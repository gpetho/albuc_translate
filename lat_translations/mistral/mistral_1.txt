Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have completed this book for you, my sons, which is the last one concerning knowledge in medicine with its supplement, and after I have reached the end of it through explanations and declarations of the same, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise, which constitutes a part of operation or surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since operation with the hand is laid low in our region and is completely absent at our time; until perhaps the knowledge of it has perished and its trace has vanished; and only minor descriptions of it remain in old books, which have been altered by hands; and errors and hesitations occurred until the intentions were closed and the force waned: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise according to the way of positioning, declaring, and abbreviating; and that I should come with patterns of iron instruments of Cautery and other tools of work; which is done by adding declarations and by properating what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a good craftsman with his hand is not found in this our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy as narrated by Galen, until he knows the means of limbs, their shapes, their connections and disconnections, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number, their origin, the pulse vessels, and the quiet ones, and the locations of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And because of this, Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 We have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Since he who is not knowing what we have said about anatomy, will already fall into error, in which people are killed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed from this science and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 I saw a foolish surgeon cut an aposteme on the neck of a woman and accidentally cut some arteries in her neck. Consequently, blood flowed from the woman until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 I also saw another surgeon who presumptuously attempted to extract a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore it came to him, and he extracted the stone with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Therefore, the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 I myself had already been called to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the weakness of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 I saw another surgeon who was receiving a fee from one of our land's dukes on account of medicine; and a black eunuch who was with him suffered a fracture near his heel; and the surgeon, in his ignorance, tightened the fracture over the wound with splints, pulley irons, and strong bands; and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he closed it according to his own devices.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Afterwards he released him after a few days and ordered him not to undo the bandage; and it remained like that until an aposteme formed on his leg and his foot, and he came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 I was called to him; and I hastened to undo the bandage; and calmness came upon him, and he was relieved of his pain.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 But the corruption had already been confirmed in the limb; and I could not prevent it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Stop the corruption from spreading through the limb until it perishes.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous boil; and it was opened after days, until the wickedness of it with its master (the cancer) was revealed.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Because when a cancer is pure from black bile, then it should not be reached with iron at all unless it is in a member that can bear it, so the entire thing may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And because of that which is said in the Gospel, "You shall know them by their fruits," it is necessary for you to know that the operation is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation that brings salvation; and the operation, with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already warned in every place of this book where the operation comes that has fear and terror.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore it is necessary for you to be careful about it and separate it from itself so that fools do not find a way to speak and disgrace themselves.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Therefore receive the measurement with care and protection, and treat your weak ones with ease and firmness, and use the better way that leads by the grace of God to salvation and praiseworthy success; and abandon the terrible ailments difficult to heal; and free your souls from what makes you fear, so hesitation in faith and comfort enters over you.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to the quantities of yours.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not heal the evil ailment; lest you be called evil physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters. ¶
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On Cautery with fire and with sharp medicine, Chapter arranged, and ordered from head to foot, and forms of instruments and iron tools of Cautery; and all that is necessary for the operation. ¶
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter second.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 On incision and perforation, bloodletting and ulcers, and wounds; and on the removal of arrows and similar things; and on the entire chapter, arranged according to the forms of instruments. ¶
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 On restoration and dislocation, and treatment of twisting and similar conditions; the chapter arranged from head to foot, and according to the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be the glory.

Pars I.	 Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 On the remedy and harm of cautery; on which conditions it is applicable, and at what time; and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 Before I remind you of the operation with him, it is necessary that I say the quality of his remedies and his harmful effects, and in what composition they are presented.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 I say therefore, that the discourse on the quality of the cautery, and its harmful effects, is a long, subtle, learned discourse, full of secrets and hidden things.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Moreover, a multitude of wise men spoke about it and disagreed on it: and to me, their discourses are enough, fearing protraction.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 I say therefore, that the cautery applies universally to every composition, whether with matter or without matter; except for two compositions, which are the hot composition without matter, and the dry composition without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 In the hot and dry composition with matter they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 For some, it was said that the cautery is beneficial in the hot and dry composition with matter.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others said the opposite of this, namely that the cautery is not suitable for the disease which is from heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat, and it is inconvenient to heal from a disease of heat and dryness with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who says the opposite of this said that by the cautery there is benefit in every disease of heat and dryness which happens in human bodies; because when you compare a man's body and his humidity to the composition of fire, you find a man's body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I myself say through his discourse; because it has often been proven to me that.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 Nevertheless, it is not necessary for it to be brought up unless he who has already been proven and has been exercised in the chapter of cautery exercise at the end, and knows the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of diseases within themselves, and the causes of them, and their characteristics, and the space of time of them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 From the remaining humors, there is no fear for you; and especially in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For indeed, all physicians have agreed upon them (the cauteries), and they have not disagreed about using the cautery with them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, my sons, that from the secret of cure through cautery with fire and its goodness upon the cautery with medicine burning, because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the part being cauterized; and it does not harm another member joined with it unless slightly.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 But the action of burning medicine reaches to that which is separated from the limbs; and perhaps it causes difficulty in healing the disease in the member, and perhaps it kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 Fire however, because of its subtlety and goodness, does not do that unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 But indeed that has been made known to us by experiment, because of the length of service and study with art, and steadfastness on truth; and because of that I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not, because it is not permitted for this book of mine to disclose the secret hidden in fire and the quality of its operation on bodies in expelling diseases, which I would demonstrate through a philosophical discourse that would become clear to your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, my sons, that they themselves disagree on the time when a cautery should be made, and place the better time in truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that a cautery is suitable at all times; therefore, any harm resulting from time is submerged in the benefit attracted by the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if a cautery is for pain resulting from necessary pains, strong, sharp ones which cannot tolerate delay; therefore, it is feared that an evil greater than slight harm may occur through the passage of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let that thought not slip from your minds, O sons, that which is not deemed true except by the vulgar and foolish physicians, namely that there is no return for the sickness that is cured by cautery; and they set forth this consequence, but it is not so as they think: because cauterization is only in place of medicine, which alters complexion, and expels the humidities that are the causes, why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 Nevertheless, cauterization is unnecessary over medicine due to the swiftness of its own vitality and the efficacy of its operation, and the intensity of its dominion: it is possible that sickness may return at some hour according to the constitution of the sick person, the location of his sickness, and the potency of his illness; and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities within him; and what comes to him through consumption of food and similar things due to the causes, unless there arises a sickness in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle sickness in a member of few superfluities and humidities, such as cauterization of the tooth, due to pain and similar things, it is possible that that pain will not return in him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But this happens in rare cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 But indeed the speech of the vulgar is correct again, that cauterization is the last medicine: it is not intended for what they intend in this matter; because they believe that there is no cure that is given with medicine nor with anything after the disappearance of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 But it is indeed the opposite of theirs and their intention that cauterization is the last medicine; this is not so except when we administer modes of cure for a sickness and those remedies do not confer; then at the end of the matter, we apply cauterization and it confers; then it follows that cauterization is the last medicine, but not according to the intention which the vulgar and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 The ancients said that a cautery with gold is better than a cautery with iron; and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the loftiness of its substance; and they said that it does not cause pus in the place of the cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 This is not always true; because I have already proven that it does not do this in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And a cautery with it (gold) is good and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However, when you apply fire to cauterize it (gold) in fire from gold, it is not made clear to you when it burns according to the quantity you wish, due to the redness of gold; and when it approaches the same cold, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire and turns into layers.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore, the craftsman falls into it (gold) in confusion; and because of this, we make a cautery with iron among us more quickly and closer to the operation, for its rightness.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And I myself have now arranged this chapter on cautery, according to the chapters; and I have arranged it from head to foot so that those who seek something from it find what they want.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing at the junction of the skull (coronal suture).
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 Here is the cauterization for mastery over humidity and coldness on the brain: these two are the causes of soda, and the abundance of flow of humors from the head to the parts of eyes and ears, and the abundance of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain; and universally all illness that occurs due to coldness, such as paralysis, sodae, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ones due to illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is to instruct the sick person: to evacuate firstly with purifying medicine for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then instruct him to rub his head with a sponge (or soft cloth).
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then make him sit facing your hands, so that he has placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that place with a charcoal (or other non-burning substance).
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then heat the cautery oil: whose shape is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it on the marked place with charcoal, and you gradually press your hand down, and turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then lift your hand quickly and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that a piece of bone or wood has come out from the skull, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, continue to press with the iron itself, or with another one if it becomes cold; until the bones that I told you are seen.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and immerse the cloth in it, and place it on the place; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place upon him a cloth soaked in butter, and let it remain until the burn is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with four-ingredient ointment, until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 It has been said that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus it discharges; therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 Some have said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone; and hold the cautery until it burns something of the thickness of the bone.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then scrape off the burned part of the bone after that, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 Some say that when the cautery is reached to the bone, it should be pressed onto the bone for as long as an impression of a knife blade is made, so that the bone falls away, forming a hole like a scar: or the instrument which women put in place, filled with vinegar: and they think that vapors from the head escape through this place, and leave the wound open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then treat it until it is healed and solidified.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 But I do not see these two types of cautery at all, except in some people, according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And leave it alone, in my opinion, it is better for its own sake.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For the head becomes weak from the solution of its own continuity; just as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head is naturally weak; and the first species of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it: operate therefore with it for the benefit.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	 Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When there is a chronic pain throughout the head and it persists in a weak person, and they use warm things, and poultices, and sweating, and oils, and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 If already cauterized with one cautery, as we have said, and adds nothing of those [other substances]: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head of the sick person is strong by nature and not weak, and it finds a very intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery slightly under that one.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize it on top of all the horns of its own head with another cautery, so that the skin is not pierced and the quantity of bone exposed, as we have said.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 Then cauterize it with one cautery on the occiput of its own head, in the place which is called 'vas': and this is the place where the sinus is placed: and grind your oil in that, and do not expose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For the sick person finds an intense pain there, different from the pain of all other cauteries of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I say this Cautery in its place: it is necessary that it be a cautery for the horns of the head and the occiput more delicately with the cautery for the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for hemicrania, both with hot medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When there is pain and swelling on a part of the head or it extends to the eye, and the head is treated with cleansing medications, and the rest of the treatment is given as I said in the divisions of diseases, but it does not help completely: then cauterization is done in that according to two methods: either cauterization with a burning medication: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The cautery with a burning medication is as follows: take one tooth from an almond and grind it, and cut off the ends of it from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then cut open the place of pain at the time with a large lancet, until there is a space under the skin where a tooth can be taken.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Introduce it into the same place under the skin until it is covered; then bind it on top with a small bandage of appropriate tension, and leave it for fifteen hours; then dissolve it, extract the garlic, and leave it for two or three days; afterward place a warm cloth soaked in butter over it, until a pus forms; then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to do this with some burning medicines mentioned in my treatise on Medieval Remedies, the Twelfth Book.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 Cauterization of it with iron, is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 Fire-cauterization, whose form is as follows.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 It is called Clavilus: because the head of it is like a nail, in which there is something hard and in the middle of it is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the location and hold your hand; and you turn the iron slowly with speed; and let the quantity that is heated be according to the thickness of the skin, as much as half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And lift your hand, so that the artery which is below is not burned, and let there be a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then soak the cloth in salt water, and place it on the location, and leave it for three days; then put the cloth with butter; afterwards care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this half-cranium with the tip of a second cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 Caution: avoid cutting the artery in this half-cranium, not an old one properly.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in an old half-cranium.
Caput V.	 Head V. (The Latin numeral 'V' indicates the fifth head or section.)
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you treat a hemicrania, as we said in the previous treatment and what we said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not improve: and if you observe from the disease that what we said with the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is insufficient, then it is necessary to heat the cauterium with a small knife (cultellare), until it becomes white after marking the place of pain with a line, whose length should be half a finger, or about that: and place your hand on one side, and tighten it so that you can cut through the artery, and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, you must be careful not to burn the jawbone, which moves during chewing, so as not to burn the side or the nerve that moves it, thereby causing a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And take care, and be cautious about bleeding from the artery that has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 Indeed, fear of this (bleeding) is great, and especially for those who are unaware of what it does, and not diligent or experienced: and they abandon the operation first with it.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I will come again when reminded of the regulation for controlling bleeding from an artery according to its method and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you observe from the disease that this cautery is insufficient and if you see a weak body tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head as we said, treat the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you wish, administer the cautery as we said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cautery having two small knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 For this reason, cauterization is better and more effective in this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing ear pain.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When pain occurs in the ear due to coldness and is treated with solvents, and with the remaining treatment as we said in the division, and the pain does not go away, then cauterize it with fire (Cautery). This is what is called a Punctum, whose form is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then the puncture points, after its ignition around the entire ear, as it is revolved; or around both, if the pain is on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And move the cautery slightly from the root of the ear after you have marked the places with wax; and let the amount of cautery be ten punctures in every ear, and approximately so.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then care for the places until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 \ paragraph on the method of cauterization in Torture.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 Torture that is treated with cauterization, is not other than those afflictions that occur due to phlegm, as we said in the division of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And avoid cauterization for the species that occurs due to exhaustion and spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When you treat this species of torture with hyssop, purges, gargarisms, and your treatment does not improve, then it is necessary to cauterize the weak one with three Cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little below the eardrum, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your cautery on the weaker side.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Because softening does not occur unless on the healthy part.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the form of cauterization is to cauterize itself with the cautery on the edge of the upper part of the ear, slightly below the horn of the head; and another one at the eardrum; whose length should be according to the length of a thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 Place your hand with the cautery until it burns to a depth of half the thickness of the skin.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 This is the form of a cautery and it is of the type of scissors, whose shape is as follows: nevertheless, it should not be too delicate, as you see; and it is necessary that the scissors are in it of only slightly excessive thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the places with it, until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When apoplexy occurs and your care and the medicine I mentioned do not help, and the patient does not have fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as described before, and another cautery at the back of the head, according to what was described earlier: and the method of cauterization should be as described earlier.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Also cauterize with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is more of an emergency measure.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then care for it with what was described earlier.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then shave the head of the sick person entirely, and place on his head an ointment made from syrup described in the book of ointments; put it there several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For this is the method of cautery; make it according to the same order as I have said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If he recovers through that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not: then perform three cauteries on the back of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; place between each cautery a thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then care for the cautery, as with that which has come before.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If you wish an additional treatment, and the sick person can bear it: then perform a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 And if you wish an additional treatment: then cauterize him over two horns [temporal regions].
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then care for him until he is cured; let the cautery be anointed according to the form that has been given.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Then scrape the head of the sick person; afterwards, cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over all the horns of the head, and with a cautery over the back part of it, and with three over the spondyles of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If however you need softening for the disease of the body with more of those [medicines], and the person is weak, and the disease is strong: then cauterize it with four cauteries over the spondyles of the back, and the last one with a cautery, until it is burned through most of its skin, and loosen your hand.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse the brain of him (the patient), especially during hyers (feverish conditions), and with the rest of the treatment as we have said in the division: when the sick person is severe or endures well in the administration of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If (the patient) is a child who cannot endure medicines, then gargarisma (a solution or ointment) and cleansing chewing substances for the brain are given before many days with good food provisions.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with a single cautery on the middle of the head, as has been described before; and cauterize again on the nape of his neck, and over all the horn (of the skull) with cautery.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of decline towards melancholy and the body is wet, then give him to drink what purifies his brain, as was said in the division: then shave the head of the sick person, and make afterwards a well-centered plaster made from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it in the middle of the head: and the sick person sitting squarely should be held from all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then bring the linen.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 It is more appropriate from ancient sheep's butter.

Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	 Then evacuate it in the middle of his head in a circle and let it go until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	 Do this to the sick person once a week with the rest of his good regimen, until he is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	 Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures on him, in addition to holding the cautery in your hand: let it be fragrant.

When the beginning of water appearing in the eye is shown to you through the signs that I said in the division, then begin and give the sick person something to drink, with what cleans his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 Keep him away from all moistness, and have him sit in a bath, for several days of fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then cauterize him on two temples with two cauteries, if there is blockage of water flow in both eyes at the same time; or from one side, if there is blockage of water in one eye: and cut with the cautery all veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in width equal to the temples: and avoid bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see something coming out of him, then immediately cut it off with any medicine that is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off and caution against bleeding.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 If the tears of the eyes are old and persistent, and are above veins and arteries that are clearly visible on the outside of the head, it is verified that this is due to excess cold phlegm: then cauterize with the same cautery as I described in the blockage of water flow, cauterize in the middle of the head, and on two temples with two cauteries, and in the neck under two bones with two cauteries.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if it requires additional treatment, then cauterize him on all sides of the eye carefully, near the outer edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if you wish, cauterize it over the two eyebrows slightly in every place with two cauteries; and they should extend from the two temples; and let the length of all the cautery be, according to the length of the eyebrows; and do not bring your hand with the cautery to the ends, but rather according to the quantity that is burned by the third eyelash.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing an eyelid when the hairs turn and pierce the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The cautery is used in this in two ways: either with fire, or with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 In the cautery with fire, command the sick person to let go of his hairs, if he is one who combs them, until they are extended and evened out.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If they pierce him at his origin: then bind the eyes with adhesive so that they do not move until they grow out.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When therefore they are born and have equalized, then place the head of the sick in your lap: afterwards mark on the eyelids of his eyes with hot wax, mark what is in the shape of a myrtle leaf; let the beginning of the mark be near hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then put a wet cloth on cow's milk or slippery elm on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then heat an iron for cauterization, which has this shape.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize step by step on the spots marked in many places until the surface of the skin burns entirely like the shape of a myrtle leaf, appearing completely.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And your mark of healing is: if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting and hairs rising at the spot of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then lift up your hand at that time; and let it go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then put a wet cloth with butter on it over him until the wound heals.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with ointment until he is well.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If any hair comes back from the hairs after an hour and the eyelid softens: then repeat the cauterization on that spot as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If however there are hairs below it: then cauterize that spot until the hair is raised to its own natural position and it becomes equal so that the hairs do not touch the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 You must command the sick to shave his head until they grow and become equal.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make from paper in linen the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from soap known and uncooked lime from one pound each or similar; then grind them well with a good pestle and make it quickly so that it does not cool down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then take a piece from that [substance] and place it on the cloth you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and put it on one or both eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And place under the eye a cotton soaked in egg white; let the head of the sick person be in your bosom.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 Place your index finger on the medicine and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 You should move [the medicine] whenever the sick person feels the bite of the medicine, because its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While the pain persists that he finds, then release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the pain subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 Then observe if the eyelid rises, as it does when contracted by fire or incision, that is good; and if not, then apply more medicine to the place where the medicine does not press, and does not discolor, until your work is equalized and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then place cotton with butter on it until the skin burns are removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with diaphinicon ointment or another until he is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 And it is necessary for you during the operation to keep the last guard, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid becomes soft after days and something from hairs falls into the eye, then apply more medicine to the place that becomes soft from the eyelid, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him until he is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that human eyes differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore your consideration should be according to this: and the straight path for which there is interest in this art should not be hidden.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 On the method of cauterizing in the lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	 De modo cauterizandi in fistula lachrymalis.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you treat a Fistula, and your treatment does not alleviate the condition as I have described in the divisions of diseases: then, it is necessary that you cauterize it in this manner.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Command the sick man to place his head in your lap, and let him hold his own head by his hands thusly, so that he does not move or shake it with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place a cotton soaked in warm oil or psyllium poultice on his eye; then cauterize it with the iron of this shape.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Let it be concave, like the shape of a goose feather quill from one end, for making a cautery; and if you wish it to penetrate to another end, and if you wish it to extend upward in this way.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and draw out the pus from it, and cut it; and if it is not open, then open it and draw out its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place on it the cautery which has been heated very well.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand near the cautery for a moment at the eye, at the nose part, so that your hand does not wander or the sick man is disturbed; and you will place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If, therefore, you reach the beginning of your cautery up to the bone, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, as needed; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place cotton with butter on it, and treat it with an ointment of resorcinol until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If it exceeds forty days and does not heal: then place a sharp, corrosive medicine on it until the bone appears; and shave it according to what comes under its own chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another method of cautery for fistula, which some of the first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Apply to the location of the fistula, and find it; then place upon it a fine cannula, that is, a fine tube, whose shape this is [diagram].
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 Pour into it [the cannula] a quantity of drachmae of melted lead, and hold your hand with good retention of the tube, and let the weak one not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And it is necessary that you place over the weak one's eye a cloth soaked with infused oil, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the location of the fistula and heals it by marvelous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula is healed along with what we said from cautery, and cure, it is good [outcome].
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 If not, then it is necessary to make an opening in the nose and lead the fistula back to the flow of the nose, according to where it will come out for itself [in its proper place].
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in fissures of the lips.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX [chapter number twenty].
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	 It frequently happens that fissures occur in the lip, which are called Pilae, and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, when you treat these fissures, along with what we said in the division of diseases, and cure does not help, then apply small hot cautery in the shape of a knife, according to this form [diagram].
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let its concavity be according to the fineness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place it quickly into the fissures, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with caerote until it is healed [or cured].
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in a fistula of the mouth.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When an abscess happens at the root of the gum or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and bursts; afterwards it becomes old, and pus runs and becomes a fistula; then take care of it, and do not apply treatment to it, if then it does not heal, it is necessary that fire cauterize it according to its size, which can enter the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then introduce the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then take care of it afterwards with what I said about treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If the pus separates and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove the corrupt bone according to what comes to its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	 § On the way of cauterizing in softened gums and teeth.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 When the gums become soft due to moisture and the teeth move, and treatment with medicine does not help; then place the head of the weak person on your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then apply fire cautery whose form will come later; it should be so that you place the reed on the tooth; and insert the heated cautery into it quickly: and hold your hand briefly, until the weak person feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And lift your hand; then apply the cautery again as often as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then the weak person should fill his own tooth with brine water and hold it for an hour; then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 The tooth moves and hardens, and the softened gums tighten and dry up the corrupted moisture.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 On the method of cauterizing tooth pain.
Caput XXIII.	 Caput means chapter or heading, and here it refers to Chapter 23. So, the translation is: Chapter 23: On the method of cauterizing tooth pain.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When tooth pain is due to coldness, or there is coldness itself, or worms, and cure with medicine does not help: then cautery in it should be done according to two methods: either cautery with butter; or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The cautery with butter is as follows: take butter and boil it in an iron cauldron or in a copper one.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then dip the instrument in it and apply it to the affected area.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse the instrument in boiling butter and place it quickly on the painful tooth and hold it until it cools down; then repeat this process several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 If you prefer, immerse linen or a cloth in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth; then place hot iron on top of it until the heat reaches deep into the tooth socket.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 The cautery with fire is as follows: prepare an iron or steel tube (canula).
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 Make sure the tube has a certain thickness so that the heat does not reach the weak bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then apply the heated cautery to the tooth and hold it until it cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Repeat this process several times as pain will disappear either on the same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 It is necessary to fill the hole left by cautery with good butter and keep it for an hour; then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Apply cautery with any suitable tip according to your convenience; and this is the shape of the tube (cannula).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	 Method of cauterization in ulcers.
Caput XXIIII.	 Of the Cautery.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 When sutures are covered in phlegm and cold moistness, and are not obeying digestion through medicines, and desire swift digestion: then, to a concave Cautery of fire, whose form is as follows.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open ends so that the smoke may exit at the Cautery from one end; and place it heated upon the ulcer once, and again, if needed, until it reaches the depth of the ulcer.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the ulcer is small: then place the Cautery according to the size of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a hot cloth soaked in butter until what the fire has burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Then take care of it with tooth ointment until the hole heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	 Method of cauterizing in the hoarseness of voice and constriction of breath.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When wetness collects on the windpipe and especially when it is accompanied by cold complexion, then the sick person should be evacuated first with dissolving medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 Then cauterize it at the neck near the root of the throat at a depressed place; and beware, do not reach the throat with the Cautery or skin, unless something of the latter is there.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then cauterize it with another Cautery at the junction of the neck and the last rib of that juncture; and let the Cautery be a nail according to the method described earlier.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with what was described before until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 Method of cauterizing in diseases of the lungs and coughing.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	 When coughing and lung disease are from cold moistness, and the sick person does not have fever or consumption, and the illness is old: then cauterize it with two Cauteries above the clavicle in depressed, smooth, open places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between two breasts: and let the cautery be a cannula as described before.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 And if your cautery is to be puncturing with a cautery called "Punctum", whose shape was described before in the treatment of ear pain: and let them be punctures from thirty punctures as far as necessary.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then, treat this with what was mentioned before until it heals.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 And let the cautery have three branches as described before.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Because the cauterization should be performed with it when you use a single cautery instead of three.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in a dislocated shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the shoulder is dislocated due to the cause of moisture and does not return within an hour from its own dislocation, until it becomes a habit of returning, then it should be dislocated again by a slight movement, as we have already testified, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the patient lies on his back or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then you peel off the skin that is inside the shoulder joint towards the upper part with your left hand fingers, and if the dislocation is towards the inner side.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Then take a hot cautery with two points.
Cuius forma est haec.	 Its shape is as follows:
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the figure of cauterization will come with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And when cauterization is done with a caution having three prongs, then the figure of cauterization will be six cauteries: and there are prongs according to the fineness of the skin touched.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 And this is the form of the caution having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 And sometimes an additional one is added to this method, hence there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 Then place over the caution crushed turnips with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 Then make the sick person rest in a calm state, so that a limb is not moved at any time, until it recovers.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 And if a dislocation is towards the upper part, and it rarely happens, then cauterize it on the shoulder with an iron caution or many cauteries poking.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	 For fusion strengthens [the area] and removes moisture; and the sick person recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 When cold and many humidities occur in the stomach until it expels itself from its composition and multiplies catarrhs on it, and continuous methods of treatment are not effective; then the sick person must be placed on his back, stretch his legs, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then cauterize with three cauteries: an iron caution the size of a finger's knuckle under the pulley of the chest and an iron caution, and two cauteries below the sides of one caution until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And stretch them apart so that they do not join when pus forms.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 And the depth of the caution should be the thickness of two thirds of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 And the figure of the cauteries should be in this form without addition: and if you want to cauterize with a large caution in the middle of the stomach according to this form, then the caution used for this cauterization should be one according to the circular form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 And the stomach is to be cauterized by puncturing it in one who is fearful of the cautery: and it is that signs are placed on the stomach according to the amount that you wish with encaustum: then cauterize it with the cautery at the point: then care for it with a cure which preceded until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 On the method of cauterizing the epihris, cold.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 When pain from the epihris occurs due to coldness and dampness, or thick wind that has not yet passed out through its natural passage and discharge, and the sick person is not cured as we have said: then it is necessary for the sick person to lie on their back on their neck, and marks with encaustum are made with three cauteries according to this shape, and the same size at a location below the hypocondria, where the arm of a man reaches; and let the space between each cauterium be as wide as a finger's thickness; and let the cautery be as long as the straight body; and do not press your hand with the cauterium too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the quantity of that which is burned be according to the thickness of the skin, without adding the middle part; and let the sick person stand on their own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has extended his legs and lifted up his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the shape of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a surgical cautery when you have subtlety and wisdom in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 And be careful not to rush into cauterizing, and let the thickness of the skin be burned entirely, for the body is being burned altogether, and it will reach the intestines; because the skin there is delicate, therefore you know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 On the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Caput XXX.	 De modo cauterizandi ulcera epaticorum.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 When there is an eruption, and you want to know if that abscess is in the liver flesh or its membrane: then, if it is in the liver flesh, a weak pain and heaviness without sharpness occurs: and if it is in the liver membrane, with pain there is vehement sharpness: and you see now that its treatment has tired the physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore, the patient must lean on his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then mark the place of the abscess with a hot iron: then heat the cautery similar to a rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And cauterize it with the cautery until the entire skin is burned and reaches the pus, until all pus is expelled: then cure it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it is not appropriate to use this method of cautery, unless one's passion for medicine is prolonged: and through whose hands these diseases often coincide with experience: then dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But rather, let it be expelled by itself, in my opinion, it is better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said that the cautery with roots of Aristolochia should be applied to cold pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is to receive from the dry roots of Aristolochia a root that is longer than the others, which is found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil: and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize with one cautery where the continuation of the collarbone is with the neck, and with two small cauteries near the side that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two cauteries also in the place between the fifth and sixth ribs towards the back a little bit: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three cauteries from the rear: one in that which is between two spatulas; and with two cauteries from both sides of the chest, the lower cautery which is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not proper that you press your hand with the cautery, rather let it be evidently smelling of skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And some of the ancients have said that there are men who use the cautery similar to a rod of iron; and they burn it, and insert it inside where the ribs are, until it reaches the same as the abscess, and the pus comes out: just as we said in the abscess of Epate.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this puncture with the cautery there is fear because either a weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs at that place which does not heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII. On the method of cauterizing the Spleen Head.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you treat the disease of the spleen, as we said in the treatment of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery should be used on it according to three modes, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One of them is that you make three or four cauteries along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauteries of Epate, whose figure precedes this.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let the thickness between each cautery be the size of a finger or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 And the method of the cautery, as we said in the cautery of Epate, should be equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the weak person lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 And another method of cauterization is: to burn the cautery with two points, as we said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus; and peel off the skin that is directly over the spleen, where the arm of the weak person reaches; and your peeling should be such as you peel the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two hot wires, until they penetrate the skin from the other side: then extract the cautery; thus there are four cauteries made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery, take three wires.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then care for the cautery after you release it for several days; for it is more beneficial than the other treatments that preceded it in the healing process.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in hydropisis.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 The cautery does not fall into hydropisis except for the true scrotum.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you cure a hydropisis with the methods of treatment mentioned in the division, and healing does not occur, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, another on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back between the spine bones, and one directly over the chest, and another directly over the stomach. The depth of the cautery should be about the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then release the open cautery to emit pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not evacuate the sick person from treatment after cauterization with it; for two intentions should be united to him: and healing will hasten towards it with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The shape of the cautery when the abdomen is cauterized should be claw-like; according to its previous form. And the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When they are incised in Hydropico and filled with citrine water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot at the nocturnal, which is between auricularem and anularem; and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then lift your hand; and do not return to it entirely.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 The citrine water will drip out, and let the cautery be in this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be with the tip of the lancet-like cautery; and let the cautery be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another lower than that, about half the length of the leg; and over the whole hip make two cauteries; and leave the open cautery without long healing time; so that some water drips out from it; then heal it with the rest as I said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in the solution of the Abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the solution of the abdomen is due to cold and moistness, until it weakens the powers retained and digested, which are in the stomach and intestines; and it is cured with methods of treatment, but does not heal; and you see a person who can tolerate an abundant cautery, then cauterize it with a large cautery on its own stomach, according to what has been previously mentioned in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle clavicular cautery; and with a large cautery on the alcatin above the loins, or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you see excessive moistness and the person can tolerate it, then cauterize it with a cautery on the sternum and on the whole loin; and perhaps you may add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 The progress of treatment is indeed beneficial, and its aid does not wander.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they are of thick cold or corrupted humors, and they are treated as we said in the division, then the cure does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries over the lower part of the loin slightly triangularly below the almeidate, and with a cautery beneath the navel as if by two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If you think that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face is purplish, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, as was mentioned before: and cauterize over his Epar, and another over his Spleen, with a cautery claw: and leave the open cautery for some time: then care for him until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 On the method of cauterizing althelul after their removal.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you remove althelul, then heat the cautery which resembles a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then insert the heated cautery into the removed althelul: and at the end of your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows, let this be done once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If therefore there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with a cautery as was said before.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them, with that which helps them from ointments, until they are cured.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over the ulcer, it is more of help in healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the sick person does not obey cutting and operation as was mentioned in its place, and fears it, perhaps he is cured with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 When therefore a Fistula occurs and suppurates, pus runs out from it, and its humors are corrupted.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 It is necessary therefore, as far as possible, to test it with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then recognize the depth of its quantity by means of a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then heat the cautery which is like a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then introduce yourself heated into the very Fistula and the depth to which the probe enters.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeatedly apply the cautery on it until all the corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And guard yourself from the burn of the nerve or great vein: or if the Fistula is directed towards the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestines, then guard yourself from these places altogether.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not perform this, unless when the Fistula is in a fleshy place: and remember that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If however the place is sealed and the matter is removed from it and remains for a long time in this state: then you know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 If however the matter is not removed from it, then you know that it is a penetrating fistula or that its depth contains rotten bone or something of this kind: whose memory will come to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 Section on the method of cauterizing Kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from thick distention and it weakens the body due to this illness of the loins, then it is necessary that you cauterize it above the navel on both the kidneys with a cautery over the entire kidney with a cautery claw, whose reminder has preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we cauterize it (the pain) for the second time in the same navel area.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Therefore, three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, it will be more beneficial in the end.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture so that it cannot hold urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the abdomen below the area where the hair of the beard begins, on the bladder, from the right side of the abdomen, and from the left with another one: and let the length of this cauterization be as wide as the knuckle of a thumb: and cauterize it with an inferior back cautery, or with two cauteries if necessary: and let it be according to what has preceded the cautery claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When cold and moisture occur in the uterus and it prevents pregnancy due to this illness, and its menstruation is corrupted and their induction is delayed, and pain occurs near the time of their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and a cautery below the lower back or with two cauteries: and let it be a cautery claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the anus in displacement.
Caput XLII.	 Head, XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When the moistness of the mucous membrane drains to the Ancha bladder plaster and causes it to leave its place, and this is a sign when they are applied opposite each other, that the leg is prolonged on one side; and there is found a void spot in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the weak one on the bladder plaster of Ancha with a similar cautery circle; after you mark with hot iron around the bladder, as it is customary; and so that the bladder falls into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let the cautery be of the same form that was used in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large oil-soaked cautery; and let the depth be made according to the thickness of the skin in its entirety.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 On the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Head, XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in the bladder plaster of Ancha and the cause is coldness and moistness; and the weak one is cared for with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it worsens; then it is necessary to dissolve the weak one from the thick humors with foul pills or artificial pills, or similar.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of cauterization in this is according to two methods; or cauterization with medications coming forth, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 Cauterization with fire, is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of them is that you cauterize on the bladder plaster of Ancha with three triangular cauteries in this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make for them a good depth, or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 Let the space be which is between every cautery of its quantity be the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be to be oiled.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle on top of the head of the anus itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 If you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded it in the cauterization of anus displacement, one: so that the circle contains the entire anus.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 Burn away the thickness of the skin entirely.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the method of cauterization for sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the anus itself, and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, on the place where the patient indicates, in which is the pain, and your cautery four fingers from the part of the buttock a little bit: and let the cautery be sharp.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 Let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the patient indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, then cauterize it there where the patient indicates with a puncture cautery, three, or four, or more if needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 If he indicates that the pain is under the knee turned towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a sharp cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And beware of yourself in all your cauterizations, that you do not burn the nerve or a large artery with the cautery, and draw harm to the patient by this, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 And I myself have already seen one and another, from those who cauterized above the buttock, and burned in their cauterization, and the leg swelled until the swelling reached the foot, and it was perforated completely, and the entire foot was destroyed: then followed a rupture of the abdomen, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If there is pain in two parts simultaneously, cauterize both in this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 Wise men have said in the cauterization of the anus, and this is its method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a probe similar to the thumb, whose diameter is half of a palm, and it should be placed at its opening according to the size of a nutmeg or less; and within that probe, there should be another smaller probe.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let the space that is between all probes be according to the size of a knuckle; and let the probes be open at both ends; and let their height be like a nut or two nuts; and make a handle from iron suited for the probes.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it is heated in the fire until it glows and sparks; then it is placed on a dish for the weak anus lying on its healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Cauterize it therefore with three round cauteries at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then leave it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterwards apply ointments with butter; and leave the open wound for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Albucasis says, "In this form of cauterization, my sons, we have not used enough due to the appearance of it; and therefore, because few are found who will endure upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 However, for those who can endure it, it is one of the good cauterizations, and it finds its place with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 However, the cauterization with acting medicines is, that you make two probes having a perforated bracelet, into which descends the rod of its door from copper or iron, the length of the wall; whose height in them should be two nuts, or about the same size.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let the space that is between both be according to the size of a finger, and let them be open on both ends; and let it hold each other in this manner.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place her on a board with holes, lying weak on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand upon the board with holes very hard.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour water between two circles that has been warmed slightly by fire, and hold it for the space of an hour: let the weak one bear the biting of it, and his burning, for he finds healing by this biting as fire does until the biting ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then wash your hand with an instrument, and clean warm water and sweet water from the whole wound: then let it be for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And place butter over it until the soot of burning is removed: then let it be for some days, and pus will run from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 For it is the ultimate help.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat this with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain extends to the hip or leg: make a splint for it in that which contains water, according to what you did for the wound equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take alkali and unburnt lime of both parts equally, grind each one, and put them in a new pot whose lower part is pierced with a small hole, according to the quantity that enters the radish: and put another pot below it without holes: then pour alkali and lime over it from sweet water, so that they are submerged by about a finger: then press them with your hand firmly: and let the pot be until the acid water comes out of the lower part of the earthen pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then mix this water completely, and pour it over another lime: boil until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 The substance will then be very sharp for acuity, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and also in the cauterization of other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Since the fire itself performs the operation.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medications are those with which anchas are cauterized, also like tesisie, and honey of carduus, and lime with soap, in such a way that each be mixed. [Paragraph break]
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galen indeed narrates the cure of a certain man from the ancients, who was cured of the pain of an ancha and sciatic vein: and he praised it very much.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that it did not require any other cure, and because it was cured from a single visit, until he reported that perhaps the man himself entered into a bath, and left from it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it should be taken from wild seitaragi: and if it is not found green, let dry one be gathered, and grind it well with some fat, and place it on the ancha where there is pain, or the leg, or in the hip: and tie it, and leave for a quantity of three hours, or until he feels weakened by the sensation of burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then let him enter into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body becomes warm, then let him enter upon the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 Because the pain disappears and is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that no one should use cautery with these medications unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides who said that goat droppings, when used with it for the cauterization of the sciatic vein, is beneficial to him: and it is made into a cautery in this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it on a deep place, which is between the little finger of the foot, and between the heel, and closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dried goat's dung and heat it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place it on wool and let it burn out.
Deinde itera illud.	 Then repeat the process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not stop doing that until sensation reaches through the mediation to the bone and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cauterization is called a Vaccine Cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 Chapter on Cauterizing Back Pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Sometimes there is pain in the back due to various causes, either from an injury, a blow, excessive movement or similar, due to the infiltration of cold and wet matter; cauterization does not apply except in this sole case which is made by the infiltration of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after evacuation of the sick person with stinking pills and similar, three lines should be made on the back where there is pain, in accordance with the width of the hand of the same [person], after signs have been made with encaustic on every line with five or more cauterizations, according to the amount that comes from the strength of the sick person; and let the cauterization be done with the cauterization needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize three or four times with a middle nail cautery in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in the beginning of Humps.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This happens frequently to infants in small numbers. (Note: The original Arabic text uses masculine plural pronouns and nouns, which have been translated here as "infants" for clarity. Also, the word "haec aegritudo" translates to "this illness" or "this disease".)
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 The sign of its onset in children is that a constriction occurs upon him in panting at elevation, and movement; and you find at the end of the spine of the Back and its knots, which have already begun to appear above the other spines. (Note: The original Arabic text uses masculine singular pronouns and nouns, which have been translated here as "children" for clarity. Also, the phrase "et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius," translates to "and you find at the end of the spine of the Back and its knots".)
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When you see this [sign], and wish to do so, then cauterize it with a cautionery that is round in this shape. (Note: The original Arabic text uses masculine singular pronouns and nouns, which have been translated here as "it" for clarity.)
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And the cautionery should cover all parts of the spine evenly; and if you wish to cauterize around the spine with a puncture-type cautionery, use two or three lines; and let the punctures be close to each other. (Note: The original Arabic text uses masculine singular pronouns and nouns, which have been translated here as "it" for clarity.)
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then treat the area until it is healed as we have said. (Note: The original Arabic text uses masculine singular pronouns and nouns, which have been translated here as "it" for clarity.)
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And be careful not to administer the cautionery on a hump that occurs due to the spasm of the nerve.

Caput XLVI.	 Chapter XLVI. (Note: This is simply the chapter number of the original Arabic text, and does not require translation into English.)
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pains of joints are due to cold moistness that spread to any member of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom among physicians to call it gout properly. (Note: The original Arabic text uses masculine singular pronouns and nouns, which have been translated here as "it" for clarity.)
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 When, therefore, gout (Podagra) is treated for a cold cause with methods of treatment and the pain does not subside, then cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is to cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the foot, with many irons: and let the cautery be Oilvear (Arsenic trisulfide).
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you need to puncture the sole of the foot, then make it with a hot iron (cautery).
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pain rises to the knee or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it on the whole thigh with three or four irons from all sides, with this same iron called Clavil (Iron clamp).
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If you need more of this cautery, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If the pain rises to the knees and back, then administer what was said in the chapter on it.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If the pain is only in the hands, then puncture around the wrist joints, as two lines are rolled.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If the pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, on every knuckle and on the back of the hand (knuckles and back of fingers).
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If the pain rises after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 Do not evacuate a weak person due to good diet and medicine intake.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing ruptures (wounds).
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When there is a rupture in the groin and the intestine or spermatic cord descends to the testicle, which is beginning, then it is necessary to instruct a weak person to abstain from eating on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And he shall use from laxatives, so that the feces may descend from his own belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then let him sit between your hands upon his back: and command him to hold his breath, until it passes or appears, a bubble, or the intestines.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then bring him back with your fingers, and mark with a branding iron under the wound on his neck, with a sign whose end is similar to half of a circle above the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then apply the cautery iron of this shape until it becomes white, and throw shavings (of charcoal).
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then bring back the intestine or bubble to its hollow.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then let the assistant place his hand on the place, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a stone below him; and another servant is over his legs, and another over his chest, who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cautery iron on the mark above him, with your hand standing straight with the cautery iron.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 Hold him until you reach the bone with him; or follow with another tool if you have not reached the bone with it in the first attempt.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And observe carefully the exit of the intestine during your cautery, so as not to burn him and it goes over the sick person or death comes upon him or a great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, the operation is useless.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 The cautery must be subtle for children, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointments until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 The sick one lies down on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 It is necessary to place nourishment for him of the length of the time of his treatment, so that his belly may be softened, so that there will not be an exit of the intestine during attempts and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then, when he wishes to operate after forty days, then administer a correctly made ligature and hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And let him reduce workload, and filling of food and drink, and with forceful voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when using this regime, thus he is cured in a complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I say the treatment of ruptures with incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 When ruptures occur in the remaining abdomen and are beginning, and there is fear that they will not be added, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let what is heated be like the third of it from then on.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then take care of him as I said: do not add anything.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And some have said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is signed with the enkaustreum, and a line is placed which is across its width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below it.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with the clavicular cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing for pain due to injury or contusion.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When there is pain in certain limbs due to injury or contusion, and the pain persists for a long time, and no healing occurs with medicine, then it is necessary to be cauterized with the punctiform cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And the cautery for every limb should be according to its size, and its smallness, and weakness, and strength, and location of twisting, and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If he is healed by the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not (then): repeat the cautery over him (the patient).
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because it is a custom of these pains that they change from one member to another which approaches them (meaning the pain moves from one body part to another).
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore it is necessary that you follow them with the cautery until the sick person gets well.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 Section on the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX (49).
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Leprosy is sometimes benefited by cautery, with great benefit.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And primarily, the type of leprosy that arises due to corruption of phlegm and black bile: when considering the use of cautery on it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If leprosy is spreading, and you have treated it as I have said in the division, and it does not subside nor stop: and if you fear that corruption will take hold of his entire complexion; then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head known as the fontanelle (soft spot), and the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hairline, and two on the sides over the horns, and one behind over the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And place your other hand with the cautery until it makes a small impression on the bone, and the outer layers separate from it; so that the expiration of large vapors is alleviated from him, and cauterize again with the cautery over the spleen, as required by the preceding part.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 If leprosy has already spread over the weak person and is clearly visible: then it is necessary to cauterize with those cauteries that I have mentioned on the head, and with a cautery on the end of the nose, and two cauteries on the cheekbones, and two cauteries on the spondyles (vertebrae) of the neck, and six on the spondyles of the back, and one large one over the alhahosos at the buttocks and one above it, in the pubic area: and two on the ankles: namely one over each ankle, and two on the elbows, and two on the wrists, and two on the tenderness of the chest: and cauterize him over all the joints of his hands and feet, and cauterize over all the heels of his feet, and the soles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 Beware that you do not burn the nerves which are above the heel bone (calcaneus).
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes the cautery is applied to the throat (pecten), and in another place to the stomach, and in another place to the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 Know that the more you add cautery, it is more helpful and beneficial.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 Know that the sick do not find pain from cautery as the healthy ones do; for this reason because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 It is necessary that the cauteries should be in size and shape according to limbs and joints as per which they were previously made from types of iron tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the cautery with flour of a plant mixed with honey and the rest of the treatment until it heals.

Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When any member becomes numb and is treated with medicines, oils, plasters and still does not heal, then cauterize the numbed member with cauteries, according to the size of the member or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 Let your cautery enter somewhat into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 Sometimes when cauterized for numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, in the joints of the back near the nerve exits that move that member, the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But do not presume to do it unless one who is wise in the anatomy of members and the exits of nerves moving the body.

Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When Albaras is decayed and does not receive anything from the resources of medicine: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery somewhat, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears, and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with barley flour and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and the blood of a dove and the blood of a heron: each should be in equal parts: mix all these together, and apply them on a cloth, and stick to the place until it heals.

Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 The wise have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 But I do not see that: since I fear that it may burn: and I have already seen that many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 It is more correct that it [the wound] should be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said; or with many cauteries.

Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has adubelati and it slows in maturation, either due to excess causing it or due to the person's weakness with age, or when it is decrepitus pauci sanguinis, or due to time and the need to hasten in the maturation of adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then let it be released.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For itself it will hasten with maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If you wish to perform a perforation of it with a cautery, then burn the cautery with fire, which has this form:
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And place it in the middle of adubelati until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be weak, so that the flow of pus is alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in a rotting tumor.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 Corrosion is only corruption walking and destroying itself: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If you see corrosion in a place that can bear a cautery with fire, then give much cautery, small and large nails according to what suits the place where the corrosion is present.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it entirely from all sides until you have completely removed the entire corruption and there remains nothing of it beneath.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then let it rest for three days and place over the cauterized places powdered sulfur with oil until all scabs have been removed and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then treat it with ointments that stimulate the flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If after three days you see that new flesh is growing healthy without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery over what remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 And corrosion is sometimes treated with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 Indeed, it rises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 However, cautery with fire is more useful in a hurry: and I myself have said that cauterization with sharp medicine is for division: therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Chapter on how to cauterize nails and warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 It often happens in the lower parts of the feet this disease: and it is a coarse, filtered thing that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 Indeed, cautery in these cases is done in two ways: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for the one with fire, it should be done in a concave form similar to a vulture's beak: which is made of iron, according to the size that contains the nail from all sides and be thin along the edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the hot iron on the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail. And leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply balm made of forest malva, ground with salt, leave the plaster on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 It will be uprooted from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the place with a healing ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they do not turn and frequently occur on the body surface, especially on hands and feet: then apply cauterization with hot water. And it is to be noted that you should take a cannula made of brass, iron or feather quill; and place it on the nail or knuckle.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula; hold your hand and turn it with slight pressure so that the edge of the cannula touches the root of the nail, allowing the hot water to reach deep into the nail root. Let the patient endure the pain of the hot water for an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then let it go, as the nail along with its roots will be uprooted.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Do this to them one after another until you have reached all those that are present on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then take care of them once they have been uprooted with a healing ointment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for tremor.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 66.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When trembling occurs in a nerve due to cold, or quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the dorsal vertebrae, and with a cautery between each vertebra, and with a cautery on its chest, and with a cautery on its stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The trembling ceases when cauterized with oil, and health hastens from the illness caused by cold.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 On the method of cauterization, according to Albatheir.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 Sometimes, Albatheir expels filth from the body, that is, pustules which are formed from gross matter corrupted.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, in the first place, when they appear, they should be cauterized on top of every pustule with a subtle cautery along with a piece of myrtle wood, whose tip is burned with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of long-stemmed aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized with aademenul, at the beginning of its removal according to this method: and it is not increased: and the excess is broken, making them (the pustules) disappear and heal from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, it must be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 On the method of cauterization during blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Many times blood flow occurs from an artery that is cut at a wound caused externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cautery of a member, and similar things: and it is difficult to separate it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 Therefore, when that occurs to someone, then immediately put your hand on the orifice of the artery and place your index finger over it: and press very hard, until the blood is trapped under your index finger, and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place in fire small oil-filled cauteries, and many numbered ones: and blow over them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one, either small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is cut, and place the cautery on that vein, after you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is severed.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If the blood is expelled with the removal of your finger from the opening of the artery, and extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, from those prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Do not cease to do this one after the other until the blood is severed.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And beware lest you burn the nerve that is there, and further harm comes upon the weak through your carelessness.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to sever it: especially if the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery, as we said before.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or by extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is extracted, the ends of it contract and the blood is severed.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or it may be tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or medicine of the property for severing blood may be placed upon it and tightened with a decent tourniquet.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 Whoever administers the severing with a ligature and a tightening with a cloth, or by placing on it things that burn and similar items, does not greatly benefit him except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If this happens to anyone and the physician is not present nor medicine: then begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of the vein as we said before, and constrict it very tightly until the blood is besieged from above the wound, and on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 Do not remove the finger, always place cold water on it of great coldness until the blood freezes and it swells and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile consider for it what requires cautery or medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	 Chapter First Ends.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	 The Second Book of the Surgeon Albucasis.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 On incision, perforation and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 We have said in the first chapter that every sickness in which it is fitting to burn with fire and medicine, as well as its occasions, causes, instruments and forms of cautery.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And there I placed chapters from top to bottom.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same path: to clarify what is sought for him who seeks it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, my sons, it is necessary for you to know what is in this chapter from fear of that which is in the first chapter on cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And because of that it is necessary to be more cautious in this, for the operation which is in this chapter often causes evacuation with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision on an abscess, or opening of the passage, or cure of the wound, or extraction of the arrow, or incision on a stone, and similar things: from all of which are associated trembling, fear, and death occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you not to fall into that which is hesitation, for sometimes those of this art fall into it as do the weak ones.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For there is one who becomes angry with his sickness and death is light upon him because of the great danger which he finds from his weakness and the length of his misery.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when sickness is from fear, it signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And of those who give their trumpet and tell you to come with them, hoping for health, the sickness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore it is not appropriate to agree with him who comes to you from those whose way is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 Let your caution be greater than your greed and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume about anything from that, unless after certain knowledge, which is verifiable by the succession of praiseworthy outcome in you where it has arrived.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And treat all your sick with prognosis and direction to that which suitably is health for them.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For in that there is help for you in the acquisition of reputation and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 God will inspire you, O sons, with His wisdom, and not take away from you guidance and inspiration; for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And indeed I have organized this Chapter dividing it into sections, according to what came before in the chapter on Cautery, from neck to feet; so that you may be relieved of what is sought from him and what is needed by you.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 Chapter on the Treatment of Water Accumulated in Children's Heads.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 You should know that this affliction often occurs in children at childbirth, or when the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And it sometimes happens also for hidden reasons which are not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And I myself have not seen this illness in anyone other than children, and death followed all whom I saw from among them for that reason; therefore it seemed to me that the operation should be abandoned in such a case.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And I myself have seen a child whose head was full of water and his head swelled every day until he could not sit on himself due to the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And this moisture, or collects between skin and bone, or collects beneath the bone above the nose.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation on it, if there is moisture between skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then a split should be made in the middle of the head, one incision in width; and the length of the incision should be like two knuckles, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of trepanation (spatium means "hole" or "space", here referring to a surgical procedure involving drilling or sawing a hole in the skull).
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If the moisture is more increased and the abscess is larger, then place these two incisions according to this form (i.e., make a larger split in the manner described).
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and its sign is that you see openings of the skull from all sides, and water is pressed out when you press it with your hand toward the inside and it does not hide itself from you; then it should be split in the middle of the head with three incisions according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after the incision, remove all the moisture entirely.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then tie the incisions with cloths and bandages.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then anoint it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then dissolve the suture, and treat the wound with poultices and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not let the head be tightened equally.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 Feed the sick person with dry food of little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another mode of incision is to consider where it appears that the abscess is larger and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Because sometimes there is more in the head or skull, or in the right or left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore ascend with the incision where it appears to you that there is an abscess and filling of water, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe, do not cut the artery, and let not the blood flow out and the sick person die from that flow with evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 [Section on Incising Arteries after the Ears]
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When catarrh happens to someone's eyes or chest and it becomes chronic and medical treatment does not help: then the final cure is more in that, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when you are about to cut them (the arteries), let the sick one shave his own head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the sick one tighten his own neck with any of his own cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then consider where the vein pulsates.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And the places of both (arteries) are the places that are depressed behind the ears and they are rarely hidden unless in certain people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark each one with wax on both sides: and cut each one with a pair of forceps on both sides, the incision reaching to the bone: and make it in the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you wish, insert a pair of forceps under the artery and cut it above with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 And let the length of the incision be as long as two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when the vein is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which jumps to the internal parts with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 If however, the artery does not appear to sight, then it is necessary that measurements from the ear determine the length of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with wax and cut to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And what must be released from blood is six ounces, perhaps you may release more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 The whole thing should be done according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the sick one and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 If there remains any flesh on the bone in the wound, then cut it so that no abscess of heat forms: then bind the wound with linen rags.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old hemicrania or acute catarrh occurs in a man due to acidic humidities and heat in the temples, or old sores, violent and similar ones: and it is treated with the modes of cure of medicine, but it does not help: then we have experience in dealing with such diseases by extracting arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method of operation in the extraction [of the artery], is that the sick person shaves the hairs which are in the temples, and stretches to appear the artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 Indeed it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few men or in case of violent coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden to you, then the sick person should tighten his head with any cloth of his, then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or apply warmth to the place with hot water, until it appears to you in an obvious manner.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take a thin piece of metal, which I have made a little earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then remove the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then insert a hook into it and pull it out towards the top until you extract it from the skin, and make it come out from all parts of the layers beneath it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If the artery is subtle: then turn it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut off a part according to its length so that its ends can be stretched and contracted, and there is no bleeding.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 Indeed, if it is not cut and if it is not severed, the blood does not rise deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then remove six ounces of blood until the third [?].
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: then it must be tied in two places with double thread, strong, of silk, or with horsehair, so that putrefaction does not come to it before the wound heals and there is bleeding.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut off the redundancy which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this at that hour, or another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a small cautery: until its ends are cut off and it remains in place for the same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 It is a better work, unless if the patient has fever, or has been heated in composition.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because cautery is of those which help to end moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it is better aid.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the extraction of the arteries, let the place be filled with old cotton: and fine powdered charcoal be placed on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the solution, it will be cured with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with linen until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If during the operation if there is a bleeding from an artery, then hurry to cut it off with a cautery, or fill the place with wax: and press your hand until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If there is nothing from these present for you, then place your finger on it until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And bandage the place with water of intense cold, until the sharpness subsides and it is compressed as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And from what is lighter and easier to extract, the vein, it is that you cauterize with this cautery having two small blades: and the sharpness of the two blades is like a needle.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However they are much less sharp than two blades.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are as sharp as two blades, then cold is required for both of them: and they do not cut the flesh quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Since therefore there is a certain thickness in them, heat is required in them, and the flesh is cut quickly with this: when this work is better than any other, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between two knives be the size of a finger's width, after you mark two places with wax: and place both very hot ones until they reach the bone, and cut through veins in two places: to dislocate what is between its extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 They are not solidified entirely with this cautionery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the form of a cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 On the treatment of chronic sharp course of tears from eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When there are chronic tears with a course from the veins that are outside the skull of the head: and no remedy medicine is applied to them with medicines, and you see the face of the sick person turning red, and feels like a crawling sensation on his forehead, as it happens with ants: and his eyes are tired, wet, so much that the hair of their eyelashes has been corroded with corrosion: and his eyelids have been heated due to the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients used this treatment for them, and they called it the cure, with the knife.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And it is, that you instruct the sick person to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then cut three slits in the forehead, equal to each other according to its length: and the length of the fissure shall be like two fingers, and one fissure shall be equal to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second one slightly less than the movement of the arms, and the third on the other side: and be careful not to cut the arteries that are in the sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and the space of all the incisions shall be the size of three joined fingers: and prepare for yourself a piece of sponge or dry cloth with which you can absorb blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert a probang (spatula) with two sharp ends, which soon follows its form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the incision on the temple side, up to the second incision: and remove with it the entire skin that is between the two incisions, together with the sifac, which is over the eye.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then make this also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then extract this probang and insert again another tool called a sharp knife, blunt on one side and not sharp on the other side, into the first incision.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place the sharp side towards the attached flesh with skin, and the blunt side towards the bone; and push it so that it reaches the middle fissure; and cut with it all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes; except that the incision should continue up to that which appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then make this in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when the amount of blood that flows is equal, press the places from the clots of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place a linen cloth from old clothes in each fissure, and put on top of them little woolen balls soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And see to it that no abscess becomes hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day, dissolve the ligature and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of this with a basilicum ointment and the rest that are used to heal wounds; until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 [Section heading: Treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs affecting the eyes from internal parts of the head]
Caput V.	 Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When someone gets sharp, intense, persistent catarrhs; and you see their eyes weakened, small, and the vision is already diminished; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and there is intense pain deep in the head that hurts and follows sneezing: then take from these symptoms, those materials and catarrhs do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 A better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it is to be commanded the sick one to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly off-center by width, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple: let the incision go as deep as bone: and withdraw your hand from the temples that move during chewing: until when the bone is exposed: and dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with heated iron or with linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then tie up above with threads: and soak the threads with wine and oil, so that no hot abscess occurs.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you release it (the wound), and see that the hot abscess is already beginning to diminish: then it is necessary that you scrape the bone, until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then take care of it with a drying dressing that promotes the growth of flesh: as if you were taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: prepare an ointment from these, and apply it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 Section on treatment for that which falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls into the ear is one of four species: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone such as iron and ivory; or it is from a plant, such as chickpea and beans; or it is liquid, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or it is an animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When a stone falls into the ear, or anything similar to a stone that does not grow within the ear, reveal only the ear: if you see a stone, then pour something from violated oil, or sisamo into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer its extraction, and make him sneeze with a snuff, and open the nostrils near the coming of the sneeze, after you place around the ear fragments from cloths or wool, and stretch the ear towards the upper part.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 Often it goes out with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not go out, then administer its extraction with Geister, that is, fine Pizigaroli: whose form is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If it goes out with Geister, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine blind hook in small quantities several times.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If it does not go out through this, then make a tube of brass and insert the end of the tube into the ear opening very much, and open what is around the tube with softened wax with oil, so that there is no windway except the tube: then pull it out with your strong force.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 Often it goes out with what we have said.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it does not go out in this way: then take from helkalimbat or from vinegar, that is, gluten prepared like birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the end of the radius after you have placed the cotton centrally positioned: then insert it into the ear opening with ease, after you have removed the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If therefore it does not discharge with all that I have described, then hurry to cut before a hot abscess or a spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 The method of lancing is that the unwell person should first be lanced in the head: and draw out from the blood according to its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the sick person sit between your hands and turn his ear towards the upper part; lance a small fissure in the base of the ear at the fatty tissue in the depressed place there: and let the fissure be lunar shape until you reach the stone: then remove it along with it, as far as is possible for you using your tools.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then lance the fissure at your hour and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If what falls into the ear is one grain that grows and swells: then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not obey you to discharge, then take a thin, delicate instrument in this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with it the removal of that species from grains falling into the ear and do not do this when you think that the grain is already wet from earwax, until you put on many pieces: then remove them with tweezers or a delicate instrument or with suction, as we have said; for the removal of it is allayed.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 In water that enters the ear, the sick person should use sneezing with drying in the first place: and already his ear has been filled with a little hot water; and it lies above the one where there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If therefore it discharges through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if not: then take many small stones of the length of a finger, soft, warm and heat them slightly; and the sick person should insert one from these into his ear canal: and salt one foot on that side and hit with another stone on the stone in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 The translation is: "Therefore, it should not cease to be made with stone and stone, until all water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 "Thus the water comes out like this, that you take one from birchwood or from reed and insert one end into the ear; and heat the other end with fire until it burns as much as possible.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 "Then take another reed and do the same many times until all water comes out; and draw it out with a probe according to what was mentioned above in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 "In the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of small body, like a louse, and similar to what was mentioned above in division, take care of it as I said.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 "But if it is of large body, which appears to the sense; then administer the extraction of it with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier for all who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 "In the extraction of worms generated in the ear, when you care for it with what was said above in division and in the treatment of distillations, and your care does not help; then you should look at the ear in sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 "Therefore, if something from worms appears there, then draw it out with forceps or with delicate hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 "But if nothing appears there, then take a probe of this shape, narrow below and wide above; and insert the delicate end into the ear according to the size it can withstand; then suck strongly with it.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 "Do the same many times until all worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 "But if they do not obey you to come out, then put the probe of poppy seeds around the ear canal as mentioned above in stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 "But if they do not come out with what was said; then administer the distillations which the ancients have experienced in the treatment of worms; and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your discharge be oil and medicine into the ear with this tool, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see, make it from silver or brass, narrower below, with a small opening below and wider above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Therefore, let the thing that is inside the concavity of the tube be made of brass.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap its end with a fitting covering; then pour oil or juice, or whatever medicine you wish into the tube; let it be in the ear; then insert the rod with the covering on top, and press it gently with your hand, until the oil is forced into the concavity of the ear, and the sick person feels it inside; and whatever is poured into the ear, let it already be slightly heated with fire; and beware that what distills into it is not very cold; medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 Chapter on the care of an otitis external.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 When some infants come out of their mother's unperforated wombs.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it happens that otitis externa also occurs in some people from an ulcer or flesh born in the ear.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this otitis externa sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which is not visible; and sometimes it happens near the external opening of the ear canal, which is visible.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear and is not visible, is difficult to cure in many ways.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in that which is visible, you must place the sick person's ear on the sun and look into it; then if you see the otitis externa, open it with a small, thin spatula, whose shape is as follows, the tip of which should have a small hollow, part of which should be sharp; and the rest of the spatula should be made of two flat sides: so as not to harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If therefore an ulcer is born from the flesh within the ear, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it out gently but strongly, until all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If therefore the ulcer is deep within the ear, then take a fine, soft probe and heat it slightly; then insert it into the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you find that an ulcer is accompanied by weakness and heaviness of hearing, then try to open it gently; beware lest you injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place linen in the ear according to the size of the opening you made, wrapped in Egyptian ointment; do this for some days until you are assured of healing the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen and immerse it in rosewater, grind some white zinc on it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see the ear is beginning to discharge pus, then remove the linen and let it dry with another piece of linen wrapped in a cerotic that has been made with rose oil; let it sit until the hot pus settles; then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If bleeding occurs, then immerse sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear; use the remaining treatment for stopping the bleeding, which is discussed in the treatment of distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 Chapter on the cure of Althaeus (Marsh Mallow) for the eyes.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 Those Althaeus that occur in the eyelids can sometimes be moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore hold them with tweezers or a hook, and cut them out from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place white zinc on the area.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And to cauterize them (the wounds) is better after incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 For many times they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 Chapter on the care of the eyelids of Græcus (Grandius).
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Many times something occurs in the eyelids which resembles a growth like Grandius in its strength and hardness, and it is called a Grandio because it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower one.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 The operation in them (the Grandios) is to examine whether it is a Grandio that appears from the eyelid and moves to all parts, and its matter is easy to remove.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Find then a fissure above it (the Grandio) in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then scrape it from all sides with ease until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hang it with a hook and cut it off (entirely).
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 But if the removal of it (the Grandio) is not prepared for you, unless after you have pierced the eyelid with a small incision, then it may harm someone weak.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the fissure is large: Then tie it together with stitches: and take care of it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 Unguent restores it (the eyelid) and fills it up.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 If the Grandio is turned downwards towards the inner ear on the surface, then turn the eyelid inside out and hang the Grandio with a hook: besides that you will need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 If the eyelid is stretched by an incision, no harm will come to anyone from it.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then wash the eye after snow incision with salted water; and care for the place with it until the sick one heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 On the treatment of Axirnath eyelids.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 Axirnath is a growth that is generated in the upper eyelid's tunics; it mostly occurs in children; and it burdens their eyes, causing cataracts in the morning, and they cannot see the sun's light, because tears flow towards them, therefore, one sees them always lying on their faces, and sleeping on those faces, and their eyelids are constantly moist under eyebrows, which have already been inflated; and Axirnath's protrusion is visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of treatment is that the sick one should place his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a linen cloth and prepare in it a piece of linen, and make a circle from it according to the size that contains Axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place it on it and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that Axirnath is gathered in the center of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in the middle of that moisture with a thin spatula making incisions through its length, and let the incision not be larger than the one made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 Or it is necessary that you find the whole skin until you reach Axirnath, because in many dispositions Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the shape of a white adipose tissue fragment.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Therefore take it out with the cloth that you have filled between your fingers towards the outside; and you turn your hand to the right and left until it disperses; be careful not to add in the incision so as not to reach the eye with the spatula and hurt it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If the Axirnath is not apparent to you at the beginning of the wound, you shall easily introduce a little into the wound until the Axirnath appears.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with threads.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And there are some people who grind salt, and put it into the hollow of the wound, to dissolve what remains of that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If a hot abscess occurs in the place, then care for it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 Chapter on Ataxmir of the eyes, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft and falls out as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural hair growth and fall out, then they harm the eye and cause symptoms such as constant tearing, softening of the eyelid, and white film on the eye, until it becomes the cause of eye destruction.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And Ataxmir of the eyes is treated according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or with sharp medicine, as stated in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 The sentence is translated as: "It is treated (by) Ataxmir through incision and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 By cannulas, according to what I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 It is necessary that you place the head of the sick one on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If therefore it is turned (good), it is well.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if not (turned): introduce the point into it, where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and let the point pierce through the thread on top, and let this be close to the hairs themselves, that is, close to the edge of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a spatula.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find on the inner part of the eyelid, beneath the added hairs, with the probing spoon from the greater lacrimal sac to the lesser lacrimal sac.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then draw out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small ball of wool from cooked cotton or cloth; then mark on the eyelid with wax, so that it is like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it must be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: since it is varied among people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 For there are those who need to be cut from the eyelid of such size, according to the size that is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then with the probing spoon find above the two lines you marked, and start from the greater lacrimal sac to the lesser lacrimal sac, and let there be one fissure close to the natural hairs, like the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then scrape it (the fissure) all over.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then connect the two lips with suture, with a needle and fine wool thread: and clean the blood, and let that which exceeds from the threads on the eyebrows adhere, if you wish to make this (the stitching): and if not, do not treat it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then release the suture and the thread for three or four days; afterwards take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, release the wound without suture, and take care of it so that it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid is to be raised during sealing of the wound and its closure; but it will be better later on.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of healing was taught by the ancients (Ataxmire).
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 Nevertheless, it is a concern for the sick person, and it comes from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method is also in Ataxmire: and it is to mark signs on the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then lift the eyelid with three separated or united combs according to the following shape, then cut what is excess with small scissors according to this shape, with equal incisions.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If it is not possible for you to hold the comb and it does not fit: then take a needle with thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and another thread near the smaller tear duct; and gather the threads with equal tension between your fingers.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then lift your hand equally with the eyelid lift; and lift the skin where the wound is marked, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bring together two lips of the wound with a suture; and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If a boil occurs at your incision or tear: bind the boil with wax and similar materials from healing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes it happens that the eyelashes turn inside the eyelid.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to treat this as we have said in the incision; but the suture is more artificial on both sides.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 On the treatment of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 It is necessary to turn the eyelid and make an incision in the interior fissure, as I have previously explained.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then, skillfully make two canes or two thin logs whose length is the same as that of the eyelid and whose width is smaller than that of a spatula; and you have already made an incision at both ends on both sides where the sutures are held.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then gather both with finesse onto that which overflows from the eyelid of the eye and tightly bind two canes on both sides using strong binding, and release it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For the bound skin will die, darken, and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If it delays, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 When it has consolidated, lift the eyelid and do not pluck out hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the shape of two canes that you will make according to this form and size in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 On the lifting of plucked hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation is to take a fine needle and insert a thread from fine silk gently into it.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then gather the ends together, and tie them both with a very fine knot; and let the length of the threads be about one handbreadth.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then prepare another fine thread called Alinxotati under it briefly and knot the ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then let the sick man place his head in your lap and position it near the sun so that the operation is visible; since the operation is delicate or small.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the needle with Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you pull out a natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then pull the needle above the anixotatus: and introduce into the anixotatus that needle; if it is one or two or three, not more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then pull your hand with it until the needle comes out of the anixotatus along with its hair together with the natural hair from the eyelid.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If the anixotatus is pulled but the hair does not come out with it, pull the anixotatus down towards the lower part, with the thread you have inserted in it, until the anixotatus comes out through the upper opening and is visible to the eye; then pull out the anixotatus and the thread, and remove both of them. Close the eye and let it remain closed for two or three days so that the hair adheres to its place, and new flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short, then join it with a long hair from the natural hairs and lift it up together; or leave it as it is until it grows out and then pluck it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 Chapter on the care of the xastratum that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this condition occurs in the eye, it is called leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this xastratum is either natural or acquired.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 The acquired xastratum occurs due to the consolidation of a wound, a cut, a cautery, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 The method of treatment is to find this consolidation and to separate its lips, and place a linen cloth between them and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 It is not necessary to use in its treatment things that dry and constrict, for if you do this, the xastratum becomes worse than it was; rather use things that soften, such as fenugreek; and embrocation with water in which althea has been boiled, linseed seed; and an ointment of dyaquilon, which has been melted with some oil; and bathe the cloth with it and treat it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 Thy treasure of care is that thou endeavourest with all thy skill, so that it [the wound] does not become consolidated according to the form which it was first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 This operation that we have mentioned, indeed it is not but a correction of Alzharath, so that the form of the place does not return as it was completely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 Treatment of Alzharath on the lower eyelid, and it is a swelling or contraction upward towards the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This which is below, is what is truly called Alzharath.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 It is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the accidental one comes from a wound, or a crack, or cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 The method of operation in this is that thou takest a needle with double thread and dost dye it in the flesh and makest it pass from the left tear-duct to the right tear-duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then extend the flesh upwards with a needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If therefore the form of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, taketh a cautery and place it in the crack, and turn the eyelid with it; and cut two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and let them be at the extremities of the two cracks from both angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle: until when they gather together, let their shape be this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then removeth that flesh by its sharp edge which is below, from that which followeth the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then gather together the separated parts: or it with thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them with what I said regarding softening medications and linen, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 If Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, and by suturing, or cautery: then it is necessary to clean the fissure flat under the eyelashes, just as was done before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate the two lips with a linen cloth, as I said before.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 The essence of treating Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is to perform the operation on it according to how Alxatrati is prepared.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 Indeed, it (Alxatrati) comes in many various forms: and the skillful artisan prepares his craft according to whatever way is possible for him, until he makes its figure return to a natural form, or near to it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in various dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 § On the adhesion of the eyelid with conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid adheres to the white part of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, you must insert the end of the radius beneath the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a subtle spatula, which is not sharp like the edge of spatulas, but rather dulled slightly; so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation and the spatula is removed, and does not injure the eye with its sharpness; and your incision should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the adhesion heals completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Find then salt water for the eye, when cleaning it; or distill into it from distilled water dissolved with zinc.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Fold then between the eyelid and the eye with a linen cloth; place wool soaked in egg white over the eye; and after the third day use zinc and with consolidating substances until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 On the incision of the nail and the protrusion of the skin around the eyes.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail is of two kinds.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 It is nerve-like (neruosa) and similar to horn, being soft but strong.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 It is not nerve-like (non neruosa), similar to frozen white moisture, which when touched with iron or tried to pick up with a nail, breaks off and the nail does not sink into it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And neither kind begins except from the greater tear duct, until it slowly reaches the eye, covers the vision, and prevents light and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation for its cutting is: that a weak person should put his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open the eyes of the patient and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then grasp the nail with a small hammer and extend it upward.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take the needle and insert it into the nail with a horsehair or cowhair thread, and make sure the thread is strong, slightly bend the tip of the needle, and hammer it in the middle of the nail; pierce it with the needle and tie the nail with the thread and extend it upward; scrape off the side of the nail following the pupil as if you were holding it with hair to its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal with a thin spatula or with small forceps; and allow the natural flesh of the lacrimal to remain, so that it may not happen that due to the incision there is a continuous flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes the nail is extended with a single hook; or with thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it is scraped with a soft spatula, whose form is this: (it continues with a diagram)
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And beware that the spatula does not touch the horny layer and there is a break in it, and the pupil is pierced through.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, throw something of crushed salt into the eye or made from seif or zinc and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of it with what is necessary until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a probe into it or a hook cannot be fashioned in it, then this kind of nail is treated many times with medications and heals as I narrated in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you wish to cut it (the cyst), then open the eye of the sick person and take a thin, soft, weak, sharp spatula in this form:
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And scrape the nail on top with a razor with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it becomes rarefied and crushed and pressed with the razor, then drip from your hour into the eye from seif made from zinc, or from red seif, or ground salt; and cover the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat the same operation until the whole thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless a hot abscess appears in your eye; then leave it (the cyst) alone and treat the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the operation on it with the razor until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 Prominence of the tear duct if it causes great harm to the eye, should be suspended with a hook and a portion of it excised; not the extremity of the excision, so as to avoid disruption of the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then let blood or make it a purging of the tear duct, or made from zinc, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 [Section on] Incision according to Alguarid and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 There sometimes arises in certain human eyes red flesh composed or laid on top of the pupil until it covers it, approaches it or tightens over the eyelashes and possibly turns the eyelids outwards; resembling a rose-bush balustrade.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the treatment for it is to place the affected person's head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open his eyes and collect the entire flesh along with appropriate hooks; hold it with a single forceps or tweezers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh first, until the whole thing is finished with scissors.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And be careful not to hurt the eye during the operation; and make your cut in such a way as we mentioned in the incision of the nail, either with a spatula, which was described in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps, with which the asbestos is collected, according to the form it will take after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When your incision is completed and the entire Alguarid is removed, then fill the eye with pulverized salt; or pour in red powder and similar substances from corrosive medicines; place on top of the outer eye a piece of cooked linen cloth with raw egg white to protect it from hot infection.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If some Alguarid remains and a hot blood flow persists and you fear a hot abscess; then release the eye and treat the abscess with whatever remedy calms it down.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the operation upon him until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And similarly do with the added flesh that occurs in the eye of this type.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary that all weak eyes of natural growth or accidental growth be treated with iron without the introduction of your hand into any of these operations, until you see that the member can endure the operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 Chapter on the extraction of a seed from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 The arteries red [ones] that are woven over the eye, and forbid the operation of life: they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 It is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which the Sebel [artery] is, is strong, and there is no sickness other than Sebel. If so, then gather the Sebel [from that eye].
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And it should be ordered to the weak one, to place his head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend those veins with one or two needles according to your discretion: let the needle be subtle of double thickness, according to this shape, or there may be two needles graduated in one body, according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect with fine forceps those veins with delicacy, and remove the blood hour by hour until you see those veins being removed from the eye and resolved: take care not to injure the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And let your operation be at midday facing the sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then pour into the eye either green or red: so that its own sharpness corrodes what remains of Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If it is not possible for you to gather all of that in that hour, then bandage the eye with what alleviates the pain of the eye: and leave it for some days until its pain subsides: and heal it from inflammation with hot poultice: afterwards apply again on top of it according to the same method, until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the shape of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 Chapter on the reduction of Arissatum to the nose.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 Physicians call Arissatum a fistula, which they treat with cautionery or with sharp medicine burning it, according to what has preceded its narrative.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 If it does not heal, then there is no skill in that: unless you find upon the abscess at its birthplace and draw out all the moisture that is in it and pus until the bone appears.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 When the bone appears, and you see corruption or blackness within it, then grind it with an instrument of this shape.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 And it is called the head-rasp.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Make it of iron and let its head be round like a rasp, but pierced with the puncture of a file, or with the subtle puncture of aliskilfer; and place it upon the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it around between your fingers, and press your hand slightly, until you know that the corruption has been ground away; and do this frequently.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with medicines made from exccentives (dry) styptics.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place consolidates and flesh grows within it, and the flow of pus ceases; and it remains for forty days without renewing, without becoming an abscess, and no accident occurs in it: then you will know that it is healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this shape.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is to expose the bone secondly with iron or with sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take a gimlet according to this shape, with its end being triangular and iron-tipped; and let the wood of it be a pyramid extended to the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it upon the bone itself; and let it be close to the tear duct; and extend your hand slightly from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the gimlet until it penetrates the bone, and you feel it weak; by this means you will find air coming out from it when you hold your hand over its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore, then restore the place with styptic medications, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When flesh arises and the place hardens: then the matter that was flowing outward returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter upon the sick one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 On the reduction of eyelid prominence.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye bulges out completely and no harm or diminution occurs in sight, then it is necessary to loosen the patient; afterwards, bleed him; then place poultices on the neck without incision, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then place a lining over the eye that is made of acacia, aloe, myrrh, and colophony.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then tighten the eye above with plaster containing many pustules.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the method of pustules is: take soft cloths in abundance and fold all the cloth over four; make many from them; then place one on top of another according to the amount required by the eye; then tighten them over these with a hard cloth strap.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat the poultices with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the poultices and release the tightened eye during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If the bandage becomes soft again, then it is necessary to tighten it a lot; afterwards, remove the bandage after a day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If you see that the eye has returned to its original condition, that is good; and if not, repeat the plaster, pustules, straps, and poultices until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 § On the incision of the bulging eyelid.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When there is a rupture in the bulging eyelid, then it protrudes and goes outside the eyelashes as if it were a grain of sand, and disfigures the human form because of this, and the sight wants to cut it; in such a case, the operation is performed according to what I narrate: and it is to insert a needle from the root of the eyelid from below to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another needle with a double thread from the lacrimal side and make it penetrate; then release the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut a place for the filum doubli (suture), and tie it with the part of Vua in a circle, and tighten it strongly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove the needle, place warm wool on the eyeball in the white of the eye, and leave it until the suture falls with the Vua.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the eye with whatever comforts it until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes suture the Vua from all sides with a circular bandage until the eye protrudes significantly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it is pierced with a fine spatula that reaches to the depth of the eye, and the moisture in the white of the eye is drained, and the eye falls down, and enters immediately; then tie it until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 Chapter on the treatment of Alcomant (strabismus).
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This ailment called Alcomant is nothing more than pus that accumulates in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself the same as [the fluid] inside the eyeball.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method of treatment for this is to have the patient sit on a prepared chair or bench.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take the head with both your hands from two sides and shake it until you see the pus descend to the lower part of the eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it is figured and does not descend, and the vision is cleared; let the patient see as he saw before; if it does not descend lower, then you know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 If the descent of the pus is not prepared as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a fine spatula and poke it with it slightly on the horny membrane next to the conjunctiva with the cornea at the edge until pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When the pus comes out, then pour warm water into which you have mixed honey over the eye; or hot water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 On the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have already said the type of water in division and what is suitable for piercing when explaining and demonstrating, then accept the same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then it is necessary for you to make the patient sit with hands on each side of his face facing the light, near the sun; and tie down the healthy eye, and squeeze it very hard; then close the eyelid of that eye with your right hand if the water is in the left eye; or with your left hand if the water is in the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take your right hand and make a strong pinch if the eye with water is on the left; or use your left hand if it is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the fingertip near the corona [a part of the eye] on the white part of the lower eyelid; then push with force and you rotate your hand along with it until it penetrates the white part of the eye, and you feel that the finger has reached an empty area.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 It is necessary that the measurement of the finger's journey to depth be equal to the distance from the pupil to the end of the black part [iris]; and this is called the corona of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 You will see it [the corona] in the same vision of the pupil of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea layer.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place your finger at the location where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it down once after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If the water descends immediately, then the patient sees it immediately on what his vision opens and your finger in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then rest for a while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If the water descends, then remove it with another push until it comes out of the eye.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it [the instrument] is driven in and does not go up: then extract almagda easily; and you withdraw your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve something from clear salt in water: and cleanse the eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place over the whole eye a piece of camphorated wool or flax soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind the healthy eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We, as well as those of our time, place cumin ground with egg white over him [the eye].
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If almagda does not obey you in entering the eye due to its hardness, because it is from a person whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you receive spathule, which is called Alberid, whose shape is as follows.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore, bore only the conjunctiva with it [the Alberid], and not the bottom of your hand into the hole; and there is no other purpose but to make a subtle way for almagda.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then introduce almagda as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And for the conclusion of your work, prepare for the sick a bed suitably made, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house; and keep him away from all movements, and from coughing; and place food for him that softens his nature; and let him not move his head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the binding be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then dissolve it [the substance] in that dark house and test his vision; and let him see objects.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then reduce the binding until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not necessary to do it during the hour of cure or immediately after cutting; on the contrary, it should be left to others because water rises quickly through a strong wound.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary to open the eye before the seventh day; and correct that with what soothes the abscess, until it is soothed; then without looking at it, and place over its orifice whatever regulates its vision for several days, while it exists in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then gradually exit the house, and convert to your belongings.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that, in the case of the zaltea, a student is not exempted from watching (the surgery) several times; then he shall dare upon the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And indeed a certain one of those from Alayrach has come to us, who said that it was pierced with a perforation in Alayrach, through which water flows.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that; nor have I read it in any of the old books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 And these are the forms of the species from magda, to stand upon him who is ignorant of them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Make them out of copper; and let the ends of them be with this same triangular subtlety, and the end sharp.
Formae magda.	 Forms of magda.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 Chapter on the care of a born flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Sometimes various fleshes are born in the nose, among which there is something that resembles many scorpions' feet; and from it is a cancerous flesh, stone-like, of a dark color; and from it is one that is soft, not of a dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore, in that which is from these fleshes, soft, not fraudulent, nor cancerous, it is necessary to have the sick one sit opposite the sun with his face towards you, and open his nostrils, and throw a hook into those fleshes; then pull them outwards, and cut what you have taken hold of from them with a thin, sharp spatula until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If something remains from the one whose amputation is not possible: then scrape it off with one of the subtle instruments easily, until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If blood dominates you or a hot aposteme occurs: then apply to it what is necessary: or if it is from the malicious apostemas, then hurry to cauterize him until the blood is cut off and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then throw vinegar, or water, or wine into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If the nose opens and moisture goes up to the palate, then you know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If the moisture does not penetrate as it should be, then you know that there is flesh born within the upper bones of the nose, which did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then it is necessary that you insert a thread of linen with some thickness and many knots, and put between each knot a quantity equal to or less than a finger: and let the weak one do it, so he sends out one end of the thread into the nose with a ray, or with whatever he can manage after doing so similar to an awl: and draw out the smell, until it reaches the cavity and comes out on his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed often the boys in school do something similar to this Attomus: and it is easy for him who wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then put the two ends of the thread, one which comes out on the nose and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then with a saw the flesh is cut with knots on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do this until you know that the flesh and the knots of the thread are together.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then extract the thread: and put linen that you have soaked in the Egyptian ointment in the nose after draining the blood for three days or more until the entire ointment remaining from the flesh is consumed.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then put a tube made of lead at the end of the matter into the nose, for some days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If there is need for a cure that will dry it out, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 To make a purge for the head, when olive oil and other medicines are to be administered through the nose, make it of silver or brass; that it be similar in size to a small lamp, open like a shell; and its passage likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a tube.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the shell-like instrument to make a purge for the head should be filled and perforated; it should have a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when heating oil in it, or whatever liquid you wish, and fluid substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 Chapter on the care of the nose.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Often a Thelul is born at the end of the nose and it grows and becomes more prominent with days until it becomes an unpleasant sight.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And therefore it is necessary to cut it at the beginning of its appearance and to remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place on the spot, either cautery or a burning medicine in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If it is slow to be cut and grows, then consider if it is made of hard stone, dark in color, with few senses; then do not touch it with iron; because it is a cancerous ulcer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 For often I have seen that an apostema was cut open and great evil happened to the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the apostema is soft, not dark in color, and you see that a cut can be made all over it, then evacuate the weak, and cut it without fear, without fear; and care for the place with whatever it may need to dry and constrict until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 On the suture of the nose, and the lip, and the ear.
Caput XXVI.	 Sint in ore incisa quatuor partes aequales, et sine aliqua differentia: una ab orificio labii inferius ad medium labii superius, secunda a medio labii superius usque ad medium labii inferioris, tertia a medio labii inferioris ad foramen stromae; quarta a foramine stromae usque ad orificium nasi.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when a solution to continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, it makes little difference for the operation, unless in some humans.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when something happens to anyone from it (the solution), you should consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then gather together two pieces of the wound with suturing: then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if the lips of the solution are already separated and each part is healthy: then it is necessary to scrape off all the part appearing from the skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then gather together two lips with suturing and sew them up, and sprinkle powder of dragon's blood on top of the blood, and pulverized olibanum: and place above the powders a piece of emplastrum diafinicon, and some other more consolidated plaster: and let it be bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it (the solution), and change the medicine: and let it go until the threads fall off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of suturing is that you gather together the solution to continuity with a needle and thread, as we have said in the suturing of the abdomen: or gather together the solution with a needle and thread, as I told you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 Chapter on the extraction of neck nodules.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many people have hard growths like seeds of grass appearing often on the inner lips: and some of them are smaller, and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore it is necessary to turn the lip over, and cut on all sides of the node, and hang it with a hook, and scrape it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after cutting with boiled alum, until the blood is cut off.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then, it is to be washed with vinegar, and the place where there is an ulceration should be cleaned with it, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 On making an incision in the flesh of a newborn on the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Multitiimes arises on the gum flesh, which ancients called abscess.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore it is necessary that you hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root and let pus/blood flow out.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place upon the wound, powder of oxytocin or other styptic powders, drying agents.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If the flesh returns after treatment, and it often does so, then cut it again and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 Chapter on tooth extraction with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 When accumulations form on the surfaces of teeth from both inner and outer parts, and between rough gums, they become decayed, yellowish, and greenish until corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore it is necessary that you make the sick man sit between your hands, and put his head in your lap, and grind/file the molars and teeth, where the roughness appears, and remove them as sand-like particles until nothing remains of them; similarly for decayed, greenish, yellowish, citrus, and other conditions until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If the root is removed at the beginning of tooth extraction, that is good; and if not, then perform the extraction again on another day, or second, or third until you have reached your goal in what you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that teeth require different types of files for various shapes and forms; because the file used to grind the tooth from below is different than the file used between the teeth, according to their shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these files should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 On the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	 Of the extracting of teeth that have grown into one another.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary that you cure the Tooth from its pain with all your skill, and be slow in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 There is no substitute for it when it is extracted: since it is a lofty substance: until there is no excuse for its extraction, then, when the sick tooth must be extracted, it should be made firm and certified to you by the painful tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 Often deceives the sick, pain does, and thinks there is worm in the tooth and extracts it; then the pain does not cease until the sick tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists. (This sentence seems to be incomplete or out of context without knowing what "that" refers to in the previous text.)
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 When the painful tooth is certified to you by itself, then it is necessary that you lance around the tooth with a spatula, where there is something of virtue, until the gums are dissolved from all sides: then move it with your fingers, or with subtle forceps first, gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place large forceps at that spot, and hold the head of the sick tooth between your knees: which you have already tightly grasped so that it does not move: then pull the tooth in a straight line, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and introduce it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with a cloth and tie it with the end of a thin radius so as not to break it during your compression on top of it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And it is necessary that you do skillfully with the lancing around the gums from all sides much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 Maintain your strength so as not to break it, and let a part of it remain, and return upon the sick from that wickedness which is greater than his initial pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 Be careful not to do what ignorant bloodletters do out of haste and the audacity of their extraction, beyond what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For many times they bring about great diseases in men, which are difficult to break and whose roots remain intact or some of them: or they extract it with some jawbones; as we have often testified this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then, after the extraction, it is to be anointed with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If there should be bleeding from the places (for it often happens), then rub something of pigs' lard and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it, unless you have pigs' lard.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The handles of the fine forceps, which move the teeth, should be long at the ends, short at the arms, thick so as not to split when pressed on the tooth; like those of large forceps, until, when you squeeze with them, they do not bite themselves or split: short at the ends, and made from good iron or well-made steel, with pointed ends; and in their ends there should be teeth, some of which enter into others and tighten appropriately by a proper constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes the ends are like the shape of a bird's beak called a ciconia and are strong in compression.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 Chapter on the removal of teeth and extraction of broken jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When something remains at the site of tooth extraction that breaks, then you should place hot cotton over it for one or two days until the location softens; then insert algasti or forceps, whose ends resemble the beak of a bird called a ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 This form is forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 Their ends are made like a chisel inside: or scissors.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not yield with these forceps, then you must be cautious around the root and dissect all the flesh, and insert a tool called Small Plank, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 The end should be short, somewhat thick: and not dampened so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the root exits through this, it is good: and if not, help with other tools whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The form of the first triangle's end, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The form of the subtle triangle's end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also helps with this tool having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other tools and instruments which have come before for the teeth's ratio.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 Also helps with this tool resembling a large hook, whose form is this, triangle's twisted end with some thickness so that it does not break: and do not dampen it.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many tools for the teeth: and likewise, the remaining tools are not counted, and the wise craftsman, subtle in his art, discovers himself an instrument according to what the operation and illness themselves signify.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because from the illnesses there are some for which the ancient ones did not make an instrument, due to the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If the bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or rots: then examine over it in its place with that which suits it from the instruments and forceps I mentioned for root extraction, and help with this gesture, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Let there be some thickness gradually, so that it can be tightened or held with the bone, and it does not flee and move away until the bone exits: and restore the place with appropriate medications for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is a small rot in the bone, then scrape it away from the rot, and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 On the locking of protruding teeth over others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly shape arises from it; and this especially happens in women and girls, that is, in those who menstruate.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, one must reflect upon this.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth has been born after another tooth and does not settle, or its locking or grinding is possible, then pull it out; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this tool whose shape is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It resembles a small beak, and is made of iron pointed at one end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And let your cut be such that you cut it many times on account of the hardness of the tooth and so that another tooth is not disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If it protrudes to be ground down, then grind it with a file made of iron, whose shape is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 Let it be all of iron, and the handle small with numerous sharp points like a file used to make needles; with which you grind the tooth gradually over many days with ease, so that another tooth is not disturbed, and it falls out; then smooth it and finally scrape it away with certain rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is a tooth that breaks off and injures the tongue, then it must be ground down until the roughness of the fracture is removed and it is made smooth; and it should not injure the tongue or disrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 [Section title] On the filing of teeth with gold threads.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When the anterior teeth are shaken and knocked by impact or accident, and the sick person cannot hold what he eats to keep it from falling; and you have treated them with medicinal bindings but the treatment did not help; then their condition is such that they should be bound with a gold thread; because silver becomes weak and rots after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let there be a thread of medium thickness, both delicate and coarse, according to its quantity, which catches between the Teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 The shape of the rete should be such that you can take a thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then weave it with both ends of the thread between moving teeth (either one or more), until you reach the healthy tooth on the opposite side with the needle and thread.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then weave the thread repeatedly to the part from which you started; and tighten your hand with delicacy and wisdom until it is completely removed; and let your constriction be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors; bring them together and twist them; hide these under the healthy tooth and the moving tooth so as not to hurt the tongue; then release the thread until it remains tight.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it slips or is cut, tighten it with another thread and it will remain stable for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of the rete for two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes a tooth or two return after falling out in their places, and they are retained as we have said, and remain; this does not happen except by the skillful and experienced craftsman.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a tooth from the bones of the cow is fitted and made like a tooth and placed in its place, where it is reinforced and tightened as we have said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 Chapter on the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural, when a person is born with it, or accidental, from a healed wound.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 And the operation on it is to open the weak bone in his head in your pocket, and lift up his tongue; then cut that nerve ligament across, until the tongue is released from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is due to the consolidation of the wound; then throw a hook into it and bore through it across, until you reach the ligament, and the knot is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And beware, lest there be a cleft in the deep flesh, and you cut an artery there, and there be a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it is rubbed in the incision with rose water, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a flannel cloth made of linen under the tongue, which the weak one should hold all night; so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If there is a flow of blood, then place some burnt wheat on the spot.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If blood overpowers you, then cauterize the place with a freckled cautery, which is suitable for that; then take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 Chapter on the Extraction of the Salivary Gland located under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes there arises under the tongue a boil similar to a small frog, which prevents the tongue from performing its natural function; and it may swell so much that it fills the bone.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the operation on it is to open the weak one's bone before the sun: and examine the boil.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If you see it of a dark or black color, hard, in which the weak one does not feel anything; then do not touch it, because it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it is inclined towards whiteness, in which there is moisture; then throw a hook into it and cut it with a very sharp scalpel, and release it from every side.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If blood overcomes you during your operation hour, then place upon it a zegi crushed, until the blood is cut off; afterwards return to your operation until you extract it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then wash it with vinegar and salt; take care of it with appropriate cure until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Chapter on the treatment of a double abscess (boil) in the molar teeth.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Occasionally there occur in the throat, that is, glands similar to goiters, which occur outside; and they are called the two molar teeth: when you treat them with what we have said in division, but they do not heal, then consider the following.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If it is a hard abscess, of dark color, with few senses; then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is of red color and its root is thick; then do not touch it even with iron, fearing bleeding, rather let it be until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Then either you will pierce it or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin; then you should cut it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation on it is that you consider before the operation if the abscess of it has ceased to be hot and complete rest, or it has decreased somewhat by reduction; then let the patient sit facing the sun, and his head in your lap; and open his mouth, and let a servant be between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made of silver or copper, which is thin like a scalpel.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 When you press his tongue with it and the abscess is revealed to you and falls upon it; then take a hook, and pierce it into the molar tooth, and extract it as far as possible, pulling along with it something from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it with the instrument whose form follows this:
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 They are similar to the forceps, but their extremities should be curved so that each of them has an opening facing directly towards the other's sharp point; therefore, it is advisable to use iron or alfuled that has been soaked.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If such an instrument is not present, then cut it with the spatula whose form follows this:
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 It should be sharp on one side but not on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after cutting one almond, cut the other according to this same shape of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then, after the incision, the sick person should rinse his throat with cold water or vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is bleeding, he should rinse his throat with water in which have been boiled the bark of pomegranate or myrtle leaves and similar ones from willow, until the bleeding stops; then take care of him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes abscesses other than almonds arise in the throat.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Cut them, therefore, according to what I said regarding the incision of two almonds equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 I myself have treated a woman with an abscess that was born in her throat, which pulled to the side and caused few senses, which had almost closed her throat; she breathed through a narrow nostril, and food and drink had already been prohibited for her, and she had come close to death if she had remained for one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 The abscess had risen only so much that it expelled two branches until they came out through the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 I hurriedly approached and tied one of them with a hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then, I pulled it out, and a large part came out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then cut (it) where it can be grasped through the nostril opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 I made that to him which protruded from the other nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; then I attached a hook to the boil; then I cut off a part of it, and it did not run out except for a little blood; therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she received food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 I did not stop cutting from the boil for a long time; and the boil kept coming back in the place where I was cutting, until it grew too large and with her I decided to do something else.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 I devised another plan, and burned the boil in the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 Then she stopped adding (the substance); then I went away from her side, and I did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 [Section title: Incision of a boil in the throat.]
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When catarrh descends to the throat and a boil forms and is long, it is called a perpendicular; and if it is large and round in the lower part, it is called a balloon.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is treated with what I said earlier in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the boil has become warm and soft, and thin; then it is necessary to cut (it).
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And if the part that is collected is round and not long, and it is red or dark or black, and there is no sensation; then it is necessary to make an incision in it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For fear of harming the weak (person).
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore when you see it as I have said according to its whiteness and length, make the weak person sit facing the sun; then press his tongue with the instrument whose description has preceded; then attach a hook to the throat and pull it downwards; then cut (it) with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 It is necessary that you do not cut from it, unless what is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 If you cut from it more, you harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after cutting (incision), use what we have said about the incision of two amygdalas and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 But if the sick person is afraid of cutting: then it is necessary that you use your skill in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 The method of cauterization in it is not, except with sharp water: and it is to put the head of the sick person on your breast.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument which we have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take from the water which I have told you in the chapter on cauterization, and make a ladle not extinct with it, and place it not thick nor thin, but of a medium thickness, and fill the depression of this instrument with it, whose shape is as follows.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let the end of it where the medicine is placed be concave like the concavity of a cochlea (spiral shell-like structure).
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 Place the instrument with the medicine on the boil itself: and let the sick person lie on his side so that saliva runs out of his mouth from the internal medicine, so that something does not fall out of it into his throat and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you apply it to the boil for a quarter of an hour with the quantity of the half-hour until you see it already softened and calmed by the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you want to take the purge (cotum), and roll it up on the end of a rod, and pour the purge with the medicine, and insert the rod with the purge into the cannula from above until the purge adheres to the boil.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Repeat this frequently until you achieve what you desire concerning cauterization of the vein.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then release it; for it will dry up and fall off in three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you require to reapply medicine, reapply it; and after cauterization cleanse the vein with a cloth moistened in butter, and cleanse it with that which is around it from the medicine; and rub it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 Externally it shall be treated with plasters, internally with poultices, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 Therefore, this method of treatment is healthier than surgery and more distant from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the vein is treated with something more subtle than cauterization and cutting; it is treated by fumigation in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take calaminthe, hyssop, origanum, rue, asafetida, chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs; mix them all together, or some of these in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and boil them; let the pot be coated with lime; and have a hole in the middle of the pot, over which you place an instrument concave in this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 Make it of silver or copper; insert the end with a grain into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor reaches the vein through the pipe, until the vein is filled with smoke.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat over it frequently, until it dries up.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And beware, do not perform this treatment at the onset of the abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 Usually a pus forms in an abscess, and it is not appropriate to do this unless at the decline of the heat of the abscess.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If this instrument is not available to you, then take a pipe, and at the end of it prepare an oxhide layer; so that the bone of the sick person is not burned, because the oxhide prevents the vapor from burning the bone; and this is good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 On the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 In this text, it appears that we are discussing Chapter XXXVIII which deals with the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat. This was a common procedure in medieval medicine, as injuries from these objects were relatively common due to the lack of protective clothing and sanitary conditions. The Arabic original likely provided more detailed instructions on how to perform this surgery safely and effectively.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often a bone or fish spine sticks in the throat, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, it is necessary to extract what appears visible above the point where the vision falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in the sun, and when it becomes clear to you that something is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make a meal of weak vomit before the food has been digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 Perhaps the object attached will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or the weak person may swallow a fragment of ginger or radish root, or a piece of dry bread: or he may take a fragment of soft sea sponge and tie it up with a thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When it reaches the place where the thorns or bones are, and it is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not come out with what we have said: then use an instrument made of lead in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 Let it be thicker than the radius by a little, and at its end let there be a hook, which he introduces easily into the throat with facility: and itself have its head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that he does not have a cough, and drive out with it the bone or thorn, or the doctor may insert it himself with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 However, what the weak person introduces is better: because of his knowledge of the place where the object is attached: and he drives it downwards, or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all of this according to the amount that has been prepared for him until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 On the extraction of Leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	 Extrahere Sanguisugam per os.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When a leech (sanguisuga) is treated as I mentioned in the division of cure with medicines, and it does not work, then consider checking the throat of the sick person in the sun, or after pressing its tongue with the tool that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If your vision falls upon a leech (sanguisuga), extract it with a small hook or with well-placed fine tweezers.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with them (the tools): then take a hollow cannula and insert it into the sick person's throat as far as its base; then insert a hot iron into the concavity of the cannula.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this often: let the sick one refrain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take cold water treatment (uitreatum), open his mouth in it, rinse his mouth with it but do not swallow anything from it; and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For a leech (sanguisuga) immediately falls when it feels cold water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If it does not come out when we have done what I mentioned, then fumigate the sick person with fleas (cimicis), or with asa (an herb) using the tool that I told you about for fumigating the throat (uuula).
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this often, because it will fall by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of fumigation is as follows: take an earthenware pot, with live plums and fire inside it; and let the pot be covered with a lid having a hole in the middle; and insert the tip of the tool into the hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then release the fumigation, and let the sick person put his mouth at the tip of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape before you know that the fumigation has reached the leech (sanguisuga).
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 The bloodsucker falls immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 And let the sick person bear thirst, and eat salt and other things, but drink no water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore, it is necessary for him to leave with this regime.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the form of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is pulled out from the throat when it falls upon itself.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It resembles forceps, as you can see; except that there is this hook which enters the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And its end resembles the beak of a bird called ciconia, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it seizes something, it does not let go of it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 Section on the opening of abscesses, and their cutting and treatment in general.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 The species of abscesses are many, various according to the recollection of them, that is, of one kind, and of one kind in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation, and cutting of themselves in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One of them is from the species of an abscess itself, and because it encompasses moistures.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 The second method is due to places where it occurs in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Since an abscess occurring on the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring at joints: and each of them has its own judgment according to the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And from abscesses there are those that should not be opened unless after the ripening of pus in them and its completion: and there are those that must be opened while they are raw, and do not ripen according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 As abscesses which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Since when an abscess occurs near a joint and prolongs, until it putrefies what is in its vicinity perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore it is the cause closer to the contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or is an abscess near a main part of the body; since if you delay the opening of it until it ripens, it will harm either that part or through the main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus, open it while immature: and it should not be opened, an abscess which is raw, not completed digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or remain at its end, which will not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 It is necessary that you know the hour of the opening of the abscess which has ripened according to its completion; and it is in the stage of sedation of pain, recession of fever, diminution of redness, and pulse, and acuteness of headache of the abscess: and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess, and of greater projection: and the perforation should be reaching along the body length, if abscesses are in parts of hands and feet, and places of arms, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and ultimately in all places equal to which there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those which reflect, go with the perforation according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to leave its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to the completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there are many filths and foulnesses, and perhaps its lips harden and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some abscesses are to be perforated according to the width of the body for necessity; or according to that limb which requires it.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation for small abscesses, and a large perforation for large abscesses; or many cuts according to the similarity of the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And there are some abscesses in which the skin must be concaved: and it is to be cut when already made like a cloth, and become at the end that has already died; such as happens in many cases, that it breaks open, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And from these [abscesses] there are some which are to be cut by a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And from these [abscesses] it is that one is to be cut as the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 As an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And from these [abscesses] there are some in which a circular cut is administered, and a crescent-shaped cut; and similar to these from cuts.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 That which has no head, such as superficial abscesses, it is necessary to pierce it with a superficial puncture, or only plainly.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 When the abscess is large and has collected much pus, and you pierce it, so that it does not spread and pull out all the pus in that hour: rather, extract a part of it from itself.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then let the abscess be opened until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then remove something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do it often according to the degree, until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a woman pregnant, or a small child, or an old man decrepitus: for the animal spirit is often resolved with the exit of pus, and perhaps the sick one dies, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your perforation, by which you pierce the abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound: and reflect.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is plain, then administer linen cloths, or ancient bandages.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if the abscess is large, and many incisions of perforation are present, then it is necessary to insert linen cloths into each fissure until they meet.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if in the abscess you have cut off a piece of skin, or you concave it around: then it is necessary to fill it with an old bandage, or as when cloth is sewn, or shorn with linen wool without moisture: and tighten it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then throw it out, and care for that which is necessary with an ointment for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If however bleeding occurs during your operation hour, then administer cold water and vinegar, after being soaked with cloths on the place of the bleeding; and put it many times on top of the bleeding place.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer a regime, cure, and powders, which I have narrated in many places of this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 If it is during winter and the site of the abscess involves many nerves: then it is necessary to pour hot poultices with wine and oil, and place them on the site.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is in summer and the site is fleshy: then it is necessary to place cold poultices soaked in water, oil or wine and oil, and let it all be cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we said, then it is necessary to dissolve the abscess, remove it, and administer its treatment suitable for it until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 Therefore this is what is necessary in terms of the universal knowledge of treating abscesses.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the method of distinguishing, I have already said about every abscess, how the way to treat it is detailed individually for each case.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Chapter on excision of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter XL (40).
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Small abscesses occur on the skin of the head, and they are of the kinds of nodules that are contained by membranes which are like sacs: as if they were swellings caused by a hen's galls.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their appearances are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 From them some are fat, and from them some contain moisture similar to clay, and from them some contain moisture similar to plaster or powders, and others like these, and from them there are hard stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in their incision and extraction, there is no fear, provided that it does not make a contradiction with the nearby artery during their incision.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the procedure for their incision is to test it with an instrument whose shape comes after this, which is called a probe, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it is what contains moisture, then cut it through a lengthwise incision with a surface incision in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with the incision from line b to line g. Therefore when the moisture is evacuated, then cut out the cyst that contains this moisture and do not leave anything inside it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For often it recurs if something remains in it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the skin in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt, fill the wound with it and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For that which remains from the cyst will rot itself.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat over the skin with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, if necessary, until you are confident that nothing remains from the cyst; then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the abscess contains a fat nodule: then cut it in this manner, with an incision having a cross shape; and throw hooks between the folds of the incision, and remove it from all sides; and make every effort in extracting the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 If an artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you later.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And similarly do for a stone in an abscess, by cutting and the same cure, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 Cutting over a stone abscess is easier, because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 Sometimes there are such abscesses in the head of certain people in whom there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 This means that I made a cut over an abscess on an old woman's head, and found the abscess to be as hard and solid as a stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if someone struck it with a blow, he injured himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 However, in other cases of abscesses in the head, except for those abscesses that occur on children's heads and at the roots of the ears, all such cuts should be surface cuts.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or make a perforation in them always from the lower part, to divert the flow of pus towards the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then cure those with whatever is suitable for their cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Chapter on cutting Strangles in the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These abscesses often occur in the neck, under the shoulders, and groins; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 On those that occur on the neck from them, there is one type and many; and they are generated by turns; and every Strangle from them is within its own layer, like a knot or abscess in the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 The types of these Strangles are numerous.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For they are stony ones; and from them there are those that contain moisture; and there are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 In that [part] which you see among them with good disposition in touch, whose color is clearly close to the skin and moves in all parts, and it is not attached with the nerves of the neck, nor with veins, nor arteries, nor is it deep: it is necessary to separate it by a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body along line b, to line g. And peel off [the skin] from every side: and stretch two flaps of skin with a knife, or with several knives if you need it, as we have said in abscesses of the head, and gradually remove it.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And be careful not to cut a vein nor a nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 Let the spatula not be very sharp: so that it does not add your hand to the cut, or disturb the sick person, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If you cut a vein or an artery, it prohibits you from the operation, then put in the wound some zegi powder rubbed or certain powders that coagulate blood, and tie up the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound softens: or if it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 For the blood is coagulated by the scented ointment (Redi), so go back to your operation when you have finished it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then ask your index finger if there is anything left from the Straphula or other small ones: so cut and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If it is at the root of the Straphula a large vein: then it is necessary not to cut that Straphula from its root: instead, tie it up with a double strong thread and leave it until it falls out by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with old lard that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then care for yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If a whole leech bursts (expires), then gather the edges of both wounds and immediately tie it up when you see that no surplus remains.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 If you see that some surplus remains due to the size of the leech, then you must cut its root and pull it out; administer the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And those leeches which contain humidity, pierce it with a superficial puncture to reveal the ripeness of it; and place the puncture below, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply linen with ointment and similar substances after the puncture, in order to remove what remains from the corruption until you see that the wound is clean; then care for yourself with a generous ointment of flesh until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 Chapter on the Section of Epiglottis due to obstruction within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients have described this section on the Epiglottis and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; this is their writing.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 For those with synanchnia (tongue-tied), it is necessary to avoid section of the Epiglottis: as no benefit is derived by that; for all veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 But for those who have a hot abscess in the mouth or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the nostrils, it is necessary to use section of the Epiglottis, to prevent loss which occurs by suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we wish to do that, we should cut the Epiglottis under three or four circles of the Epiglottis, with a small section across its width in the area between two circles, which should be a section in siplach (cartilage), not cartilage; and this location is suitable for sectioning because it lacks flesh, and the blood vessels from it are far away.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the surgeon is afraid, then it is necessary that he spreads the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then let him find the skin until he reaches the channel (trachea): if he sees anything from them (the lungs or any fluid), let him remove the blood vessel.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then cut the carotid artery as we have mentioned, and it is signified by the escape of mucus from the trachea when it is divided, and by the separation of the voice (trachea).
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And let the open wound remain for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 When the fear of suffocation is removed, gather two lips of the wound skin, and the skin itself without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medications that cause growth of flesh until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Says Al-Zahrawi (Albucasis).
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 In conclusion of the discourse we have told, its interpretation is not given except when they see that one of these abscesses (boils) has opened the throat of a sick person: and he is raised up above death and wishes to be cut open in his suffocation: they go to cut Epiglottis so that the sick person may breathe over the place of the wound with some breath, and thus be saved from death: and for this reason they commanded to let the wound remain open until the malignancy of the disease is consumed, and its malignancy is for three days and seems like itself: then they command to sew up the wound, and care for it until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And the thing I saw by myself was that a servant girl took a knife and sent it into her own throat, and cut a part of the trachea of the lung with it.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called to treat her, and I found her groaning, as is the groan of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 I then uncovered the wound, and found that blood had come out from the wound, albeit little.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 The wound had not been incised nor lanced; and pus was discharging from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I cured it myself and dressed the wound until it healed completely; nothing happened to the maiden, except a slight hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after several days to a better state of health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Hence I say that there is no fear in cutting the Epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 Chapter on Cutting a Hernia in the Throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This swelling called a hernia of the throat is a large swelling, according to the color of the body; and it occurs more frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 And it occurs in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 Certainly there is no innate tendency to it.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The accidental one occurs in two ways; the first resembles fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the second is similar to a swelling that results from the thickening of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And there is fear associated with it; and it should not be approached with a knife without caution, unless it is small; and you should examine it and probe it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it similar to a fatty knot and it is not suspended with any veins; then cut it, just as knots are cut; and extract it along with the surrounding flesh if it is in the cavity of the throat; and if not, then examine the entire area carefully.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the location with what is required for treatment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Chapter on Cutting Across Nodes (Overview).
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many types of nodes, and I have already described all their types in the division; it is necessary to distinguish here between a node and an abscess, as there can be doubt about this matter.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 I therefore say that when heat and fever and violent pains are present until the ebullition of superfluity subsides and putrefaction is complete: then indeed fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 When the knot is not hot nor feverish, nor are there pains present, and it contains them with a bag that is specific to them, according to the color of the body: and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a grape, and it grows bigger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they are of two kinds: either fatty: or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 The colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you come to the treatment of the knot, it is necessary that you test it and investigate it first with an instrument called Introscope, according to its form as will be described in the chapter following this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 And the method of examining boils and knots is to receive this instrument (Introscope) and insert it into a moist place which you find in the boil: and you move your fingers slowly with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then, finally, place your hand upon it according to the size of the boil.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then extract the Introscope, and observe what comes out after its trace.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If moisture of any color comes out, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said about other boils.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if no moisture comes out in the trace of the Introscope, then you know that it is fatty: cut it with an incision in the shape of a cross, as I have taught you: and hang it up with hooks, and scrape off the skin from all sides with ease: and keep the bag if possible over it, so that you can draw out the healthy part along with the knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If however a cyst is ruptured during the operation and it cannot be extracted whole as it often happens, then extract it piecemeal until something remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 If some part remains, either little or much, a nodule returns most often.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it conquers you and some part remains: then fill the wound at your completion with certain corrosive powders and sharp ones; and sew up the wound, and place upon it what sits there, a hot abscess, and take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If therefore the nodule is large, then cut two lips of it and take care of it along with that which becomes incarnated.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 If it is pulsating or non-pulsating artery to you: then rush, and fill the place with boiled wine, and leave it closed for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of blood ceases; then return to cut what remains of the nodule.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 Chapter on external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 These are the forms of the instruments to be introduced and there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 Among them is a large one, among them is a medium-sized one, and among them is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Make them out of iron squares with well-centered ends so that they enter quickly into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are the forms of the Perforators and Nozzles (piercing instruments): one of them is called Beris, that is, piercing; and there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 From these there is a great one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They come together so that they may be treated by means of cauterization, excision, fistulas, and boils that are located near the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And some are round, polished, smooth, similar to large needles which have seats made of citron or brass or iron or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 The better ones among them are those that are made of citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And experience also shows that black lead is useful for treating fistulas whose concavity serves as a mirror, so that they may be treated gently with these mirrored areas.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And there are again three types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because from these come the long ones, the medium ones, and the short ones, according to the size of the fistula and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The shape of pincers is various.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because from these come the simple ones, that is to say those with a single curvature; and there are three types as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And among them there are blind pincers; and there are three types.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And among them there are pincers with two curvatures; and there are three types of these: and among them there are pincers with three curvatures, and there are three types of these: and all these are necessary in their respective places.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are the shapes of knives, with which knots and cauterizations are cut and scraped; and there are three types: because from these come the large, medium, and small ones.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 The tips of which cutting is made are sharp, the other ends are not sharp; and they are not placed thus except for assistance in scraping knots near the fear of cutting a vein or nerve; and that the weak may be healed through them, and find some temporary relief from the burning that is found during the scraping of cauterizations.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are Magda, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of brass and resemble a rod similar to how alcohol is made: at the end it has a broad hole, hidden point Spatumilis running through both inner and outer parts as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The shape of Spatumilium hidden between the fingers at the opening of abscesses: these are not felt by the sick; there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The forms of Ventosarium with which the flow of blood is cut off: there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 Make them of brass or citron, round, slightly shorter in length than you see, and refined to be delicate.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And these forms of Ventosarium should be large and small with you so that you can cut off the blood quickly in case of necessity, and when no medicine is present for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, do not use them for cutting off blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy parts: such as the arms, legs, hips, shoulders, breasts, abdomen, groin, etc., from moist fleshy parts.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 Sometimes they are made into small instruments similar to the balls of a fist, according to their shape, with which blood is cut off when it flows from the site of phlebotomy or incision of vein or artery; and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 [Chapter Title] On the treatment of male breasts resembling female breasts.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the breasts of certain men become inflamed during sleep (that is, when they begin to dream), until they resemble the breasts of women and remain as abscesses with a foul smell.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 The person who is repelled by it (the lump), it is necessary to cut through the breasts with a lunar incision, according to this shape from the line 'b' to the line 'g'. Then scrape off the entire fatty tissue.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Then fill the wound with an ointment made of pitch.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then join together two lips of the wound with a suture, and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the breast leans towards the lower part and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then it is necessary to make an incision in both upper sides of the breast, in two similar sections like a lunar shape, each one containing the other at their ends so that the larger line contains the smaller one, according to this shape from the line 'b' to the line 'g'. Then scrape off the skin between the two lips, remove the fat, and apply what was mentioned about suturing and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If you do not complete the incision that is required to be made due to the restlessness of the patient or due to bleeding: then fill the wound with a plaster submerged in a caustic ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains from the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 Chapter on Perforated Boil, which happens under the armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These boils that occur under the armpit are of the types of Strophulas which contain cysts, and there are those that contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Those that contain moisture should be cut through with a lunar incision, according to this shape from the line 'b' to the line 'g'. When everything in the boil is evacuated by pus, then fill it with an old plaster and leave it for another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the wound, and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If it is an abscess resembling a knot of swellings (boils), then cut it open as we have said regarding incisions on boils equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If the wound extends and discharges pus, then apply cautery to it, as we have said in what was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 Chapter on the incision of an abscess that occurs due to an artery and a vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery bursts and the skin above it hardens, there is often an abscess; similarly, this also occurs with veins, so that an abscess and swelling occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which one recognizes that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery or vein, are as follows: for when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long and aggregated in the depth of the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel a grating sensation.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 What concerns the Vein is round in obvious body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And the incision over this boil is a mistake, especially when it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many parts of the body; it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, its care with iron should be avoided, and what is also in the extremities or head should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Find in the skin incision, along the length, what is from the swelling of the opening of the Artery.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with scissors, subsequently the Artery; and free it from tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert the point under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the Artery with double thread at two places, according to what I taught you for the extraction of two Arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then puncture the place that is between two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then administer treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off; afterwards treat that with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If it is an abscess due to the incision of a Vein, then you should hold with your hand what is possible from the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert the point under the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let a double thread be in it until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then tie the abscess with a good ligament; according to what I told you for the ligature of the vein, with two parts and with two ends of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 If you fear that the thread is pulled out, then insert another point with a different thread under the entire abscess near the incision; press and tie your threads at four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the abscess in half through its center until what is in it comes out; then cut off the superfluity of the skin, and let what was tied from that be released.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place a poultice made with wine and oil on top of it (the abscess).
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer the treatment which is made with linens and unguents until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 On amputation that occurs due to a twist in the nerves.
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As an amputation occurs in an Artery and Vein, similarly it occurs in Nerves; what happens to them is either a blow or due to excessive labor, and similar causes; and it mostly happens at the locations of joints or heels, and in every location where the joints move; and it is a grave amputation.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 It resembles the color of the rest of the body and is without pain in many dispositions; and when it is squeezed with violence, it feels weak like numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And the amputation is not gathered deep within the body but rather under the skin, and it moves to every part, but does not extend towards the front or towards the back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 What is in the joints, therefore, should not be penetrated with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Perhaps it will happen that there is a contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 However, if what is from them is in the head or forehead, puncture the skin with a lancet.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If the amputation is small, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and strip it; then remove it, and bandage the wound with sutures; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 On the incision of an amputation that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 In some humans, amputations occur repeatedly in their bellies and in their other bodies, which are called Fungalia, similar to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Whose root is delicate, and the head of them is large, and their lips are turned over.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And it is one of them (pl.) that is small: and it is one of them (pl.) that is greatly enlarged.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 I myself have seen a man, and within his abdomen were two things similar to fungi: they were larger than other items; there was no difference between them, being white and having small roots, their lips turned inward and closed, and fluid flowed from them continually.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I weighed one of them and it was about 8 ounces, and the other one about 6 ounces. And the operation in cutting them is that you consider if the patient is weak or sick, and the gallstone is white, moist, soft, having a small root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cautionery in your presence ready in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 For many times blood is expelled during its section: therefore be careful if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a man who is weak, fearful and timid about cutting with iron, then take a well-made thread of lead, and bind it with that, using the method we have mentioned, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add to the binding of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not stop binding with lead as long as it presses against the gallstone, until it is separated and falls out by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If the gallstone is large-rooted, then there is some fear and timidity in cutting it; especially because it is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 However, it is possible to cut its half.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the wound until it heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And be careful not to cut a gallstone of dark color, few senses, foul appearance; for it is a cancerous abscess; and I will come back with the reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 Treatment for protrusion of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	 Si protruderit umbilicus, scinde huiusdem longitudinis intermediis lineis ab integumento omnis partem usque ad os pubis; si intra abscessum inveneris, recise abscessum et lavere caulem; si autem non invenieris, lavere umbilicum. Postea pone duas lineas longitudinales, una dextera, alia sinistra, usque ad os pubis, et scinde inter se perpendicularare a lineis longitudinalibus quinque partes; postea collige partes in loco ubi fuerat. Cum pectinet uterus cum foetu, si sicut est, nec sanguine infectus est, ponito manum super uterum, et scinde uterum usque ad os pubis, et recise totam membranam, quae circumdabit uterum, et dimitteto uterum e loco, cum quodam pondere, ut foetus in medium cadat; si autem sanguine infectus fuerit, ponito manum super uterum usque ad os pubis, et scinde uterum usque ad venae portas. Postea accipe catheterum ac uterum reponito in loco suo cum pondere de quodam pondere; si umbilicus fuerit mollior, ponito in umbilico aeneum catheterum et inmodicum, et sic omnis materia extinguetur. Si autem fuerit durus, ponito catheterum de plumbo et aperto, ut effundat urinam; si vero non possis accedere ad umbilicus, cum umbilico pondere, usque ad os pubis, protrudatur. Si intra abscessum inveneris, ponito manum super abscessum et scinde abscessum et lavere caulem; si autem non invenieris, ponito catheterum de auro ac uterum recide et perforare in loco ubi fuerat.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 A protrusion of the umbilicus arises from various causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 It arises either from the hernias called sifac, which are above the abdomen; or it comes out of althub (or intestines), according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 It arises either from blood flowing from a vein or an artery, as mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 It arises from the obstruction of gas within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If it is due to a hernia of the sifac and protrusion of the thirb (small intestine): then its color is similar to that of an abscess or body; it is soft, without pain; and it appears in various positions.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its position (or orientation) with respect to what we mentioned is of a more violent variation.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 Therefore when you press it with your fingers, it is concealed; then it returns and perhaps there is a sound; and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath and causes severe pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 If it is due to moisture, it is soft; then when you press it with your hand, it does not conceal itself or contract or increase in size.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood, then with these signs (swelling, hardness, and inflammation) an abscess appears on the side of the back.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 If it is due to born flesh: then the abscess is severe, large, hard and festers in one place according to its size.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If it is due to gas, then when touched, it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 The operation in this case is to determine whether the protrusion of the umbilicus is due to blood from an artery or vein, gas, or moisture; then it is necessary to refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said that abscesses are due to an artery or vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 If the projection of the navel is due to intestine or hernia: then it is necessary that you order the patient, so that he holds his breath and stands extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then mark around the navel with hot iron (encaustricum).
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Afterwards order him to lie down on his back between your hands (on his back).
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then, with a broad-bladed knife (spatulam), circle around the navel over the place which you marked with hot iron.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then stretch the midline incision upward with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind him around with strong thread or cord of silk; and let the knot be a reef-knot (alexandrine).
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open up the extended midline incision above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you find it already detached from the ligament: then pull out the reef-knot, and insert your index finger into it, and push the hernia into the abdominal cavity; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 If however, it is an artery or vein (against you): then circle it very much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert strong threads into them; and insert the needles into the circle you made around the tumor in the manner of a cross, causing them to penetrate through.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then stitch the tumor in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and let the rotten flesh extend; and when it falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes soft and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with what is necessary from ointments, until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the projection of the navel is from flesh sore or dampness on him: then make a hollow in the tumor, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And draw out blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then take care of it with what solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 On the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have already said about the species of Cancer in division, and how is its treatment with medicines; it is to be careful not to use iron in its cure as it may not ulcerate; we have said that Cancer is generated in the matrix, and caution against cautery in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients have said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated; such as Cancer which is in the breasts, or hips, and similar limbs for complete extraction; especially when it is beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 But when it grows old (or large), it should not be approached.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I was not able to heal anyone from it; nor have I seen anyone before me who has reached that point.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when placed as we have said, is to precede and loosen the weak one from black choler several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then if you find phlebotomy (or bloodletting) with clear repletion, perform it.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the weak one with a preparation where it is to be placed during the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then thrust the pincers that fit into Cancer into Cancer.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow out Cancer from all sides with skin, according to inspection, until nothing remains of its roots; let the blood flow and do not separate it quickly, but press out the places and remove thick blood completely with your hand or, if possible, there with instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if the flow of thick blood from an artery or vein opposes you; then cauterize (or tie off) the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 [Section Title: On the Treatment of Hydrophobia]
Caput LIIII.	 [Chapter IV.]
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We now narrate on the division of Hydropisis species and how the water accumulation occurs; and signs of all species, and cure of it with medications.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And that which is cured with iron, is only the species of scrotum; and it does not approach iron with the species of tympanites; nor deeply with the species of hypoascara, for it is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you are already cured from this species of Hydropisis (timpanites) with medications and the treatment did not help; then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if weakness has already come to the sick person or there is another disease apart from Hydropisis such as cough or diarrhea, and similar ones; then be careful not to treat him with iron, for it is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 But if you see the sick person with excessive strength, and there is no other disease apart from Hydropisis alone; and he is neither a child nor an old man; then there is room for operation on him. You lift the sick person standing between your hands, and the assistant follows him, pressing his stomach with his hand to drive water down to the lower part of the neck.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a pointed instrument (spatula), as shown in this figure.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 Let it be made of two sharp parts, long and having a sharp point like the spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 Nevertheless, there should be something shortened in it so that you do not pass through it during the operation to the intestine and injure it.
Deinde considera.	 Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if the generation of Hydropisis is from the part of the intestines, then it should be stretched with a section of three fingers length downwards above the neck.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 But if the generation of Hydropisis is due to liver disease; then your section should be on the left side from the navel three fingers length.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the section be on the right side: and it is not necessary that the incision should also be on the side towards which the weak will lie, so that the superfluities do not run to the fragile place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Perforate the entire skin with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert your hand into that incision and push the Spatula (or spatula-like instrument) under the skin, as if you are scraping it; let the amount scraped off be about the size of a nail or around that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then perforate the spatula (or spatula-like instrument), until it reaches the empty place; and that is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then draw out that part, and insert an instrument into the opening, of which this is its form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver, copper, brass, tin, thoroughly cleaned; in its lower part there is a small hole, and on both sides there are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side; and make the end of it slit, like the tip of a reed, as you see; at the upper end of it is a band.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water a half-hour quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Because if you evacuate more than is necessary from it, perhaps the sick person will die by resolution of his vital spirit; or it may happen to him that a syncope occurs which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 But evacuate from it according to its strength, and according to what the dispositions of the sick person indicate to you by his pulse, and by his condition.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then draw out the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 Because it is retained immediately due to the skin which retains the hole that is on the spatula (or spatula-like instrument), of which I have told you to perforate it in that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then on the second day, if you see that the patient can bear it, repeat the operation and extract a smaller amount from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Repeat the operation several times without fear, and be careful not to err until only a small amount remains in water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, then care for him with warm sand, frequent sweating in a bath and sun, and wait for thirst. And care for him with very strong medicines until he is healed. Then cauterize above the stomach, intestines, and spleen after the extraction of water, as I previously narrated.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 Chapter on the care of infants born in places where their urethras have not been pierced.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When an infant is born from the mother's womb and his head has not been pierced with a circumcision or the opening is narrow, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to pierce it immediately at birth with a very sharp spatula in the following manner.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a thin nail made of lead into the hole and tie it; hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When one wishes to void urine, remove [the nail] and mix [it].
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then bring it back [into place].
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not insert lead, it is now possible that the urine flowing over the area will not allow the hole to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 He whose hole is narrowed is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those in whom the hole is not in its proper place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 For this reason, because the hole is located at the end of the spinal column of those born, one cannot mix it towards the front until he raises the spine with his hand to higher areas.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 It is not the procreation of such [person], because semen cannot reach the uterus in the correct manner; and it is a very foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the method of operation in this case is for the sick person to lie on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend your left hand and stretch it with great force, cut the head of the spinal column from the place of priapism, with a sharp or pointed knife, similar to cutting a reed or grinding something, so that the medium comes out like the head of the spinal column; and let the hole fall in the middle as required.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And be careful during your operation not to allow bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For this often occurs.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore press the place where the blood flows and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 On Albater that occurs in the foreskin and head of the penis, on decay, blackening, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 66.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 These abscesses occur frequently in the urethra and are a prominent growth of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from this one is malignant, and another is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore it is necessary to suspend the non-malignant one with a fine hook and cut it off until you cleanse it completely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place upon it a shallow dish immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it yourself afterwards with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If the abscess is malignant and of a foul color, then it is necessary to apply cautery after its incision and its ligation.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 If the abscess is in a circumcised foreskin and part of it is inside and part outside, then remove the abscess that is inside first until it consolidates, then take care of it externally; because when you treat it at the same time, the foreskin does not heal but rather exudates.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 Also they occur in testicles, and the foreskin becomes black and corrupted.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, it is necessary to excavate completely everything that has become darkened, or what will soon be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then apply a linen cloth soaked with honey that has been beaten with wheat flour and sieved bran of grains and crushed herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If there is a flow of blood, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery according to this shape: [draws a shape]
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 Because cautery is useful for two conditions at the same time, namely for a flow of blood, and when a wound is torn.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of the urethra is torn and the whole thing collapses within an hour: then it is necessary to insert a tube made of lead into the bladder, so that the sick one urinates over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion indeed does not occur unless in him whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required for it: and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or an abscess: therefore, it is necessary to excoriate it with a blunt Spatumil until the ligament dissolves, and the head of the penis is released from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish it precisely, then it is necessary to excoriate something from the head of the penis and the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 Because the foreskin, when it is thin, may be easily perforated due to its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth that has been prepared in cold water, so they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it should be treated with wine steeped until it becomes firm.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 Section on the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that may occur to them.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a solution for continuity, as with other wounds; however, since it originates from our operation, and its use is specifically for children, it is necessary to mark an improvement in the operation and a path leading more easily towards health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore, I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books; because they do not use it in their laws, and there is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 Because I have found the majority of craftsmen and phlebotomists to use cleansing by circumcising with scissors and forceps; they use the treated, bound, and incised with a needle and knife.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and found no better cleansing with scissors, nor binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Because in cleansing with scissors, the skin often escapes (or: slips away).
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Because the prepuce has two layers of skin: perhaps the superficial skin is cut, and the lower layer is torn: therefore it is forced to make an incision again, and pain will result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with the cleansing done by alfecat, that is, by fingers, as shoemakers use it, it is not cut off at the end of the virile member, since it may enter its hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 But in cleansing with the nail, perhaps iron may come out (or: slip in), and ruin your operation; and indeed the skin of a child is short by nature, and such things often occur, which do not require cleansing; and I myself have seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 The cleansing with scissors and binding with thread was found to be a good test for me, because scissors are proportional to the incision; therefore, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate and they cut according to one operation at the same time; and it forms a compression similar in shape, containing the skin of the member with a rod from all sides, so that no error whatsoever occurs.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 The method of the operation is for you to assess, whether a child especially, if he understands a little, that you do not do, except that you tie thread on his member only; and let it be until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then let him rejoice and be happy as much as possible for you, from the fact that he receives his intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and he should not be seated; and conceal scissors in your sleeve or underfoot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into his member and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the member emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then clean that part which has accumulated dirt upon it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then bind the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Then tie lower down a smaller ligature in addition.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold it with your index finger and thumb, and press firmly on the lower ligature to maintain tension, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then peel off the skin quickly, and extract the head of the member.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better), and sprinkle flour on top; and place a cloth on top, which has been soaked with cooked mutton broth diluted in rosewater, pounded with fresh good olive oil; and leave it there until another day; and care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The shape of the scissors for cleansing is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 The two ends should be flat and curved, and no branch of the nail should project out of them; and the length of the two cutting edges should be equal to the length of two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 However, if an error occurs during cleansing, it is because the inner skin may have escaped entirely, or a part of it may remain near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you stretch it with your nail from your hour before the removal of the place; and cut it in equal parts.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a tweezers, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 If it passes beyond three days and what is beneath the belt is swollen, it is an abscess: then release it until the abscess sits down hot, and scrape it off easily, and cut it according to what is prepared for you: and be careful from the head of the belt.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 It will not harm him that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Therefore take care of it with him as consolidating the wound with the powders which we have mentioned in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut above the measure and goes to the upper parts, it will not harm him even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore take care of it with him until it heals up.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 Chapter on the extraction of a retained bladder stone.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by an overfilling made from a stone, congealed blood, pus, meat born, and similar things from those which we said are cured in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the urine is not released and you see its retention is due to a stone that has already entered the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for him to be weakened on his knees bent down.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then place his feet on top of his back, and let him extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back and tighten his breathing as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Therefore, with the neck of the bladder, he is compelled to expel the stone towards the back: whereby the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If it is not released with what was said and the strong person is overpowering the weak one: then it is necessary to administer the extraction of his bladder with an instrument called a syringe, whose shape is like S. It should be made from silver, thin, flexible, concave like a feather quill in delicacy, long like the palm of one hand and a half: at its head should be a fine cannula.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 The method of removing a worm is to take a doubled thread, tie one end of it with wool or cord, a good binding: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe: and cut off if there is any excess from the wool, but force it into the cannula as powerfully as possible, like an arrow.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and with egg white: and make the patient sit on a chair, and warm up the bladder, and anoint the worm with moist oils and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then insert the syringe into the worm gently until it reaches the root of the worm.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then fold it twice above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has reached an empty place: and this is not done according to this order unless because the passage through which it goes is twisted.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then gradually stretch out the thread with the wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 For the worm will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then draw it out and make the worm run through the urinary way: and repeat the syringe, and do not stop doing that until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 Chapter on the quality of clepsydra of the bladder.
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX (the number in Roman numerals).
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When there is an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus collects, and there is a desire to distill water and medicines into it: then make with the instrument that is called Clepshydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And in it there are three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 The hollow place where that which pushes is located should be of a size suitable for it without any addition, until when something else is drawn with it, it is attracted by humidities; and when it is pushed, it is expelled to a distance: as the balance does, which projects oil, that is, Greek fire in the wars of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 When the force is to throw humidities into a hollow, introduce the end of the balance (clepsyra) into the humidity and draw that which pushes it upwards; for humidity is attracted into the depression of the balance.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then introduce its end into a rod, as we have said in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then push the humidity with that which pushes it; for that humidity immediately reaches the bladder, so that the sick person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The form of the clyster (enema) should be subtle, with which the bladder is cleansed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Make it of silver or gold; its head should be higher, like the small albuca (syringe), and beneath it there should be a cavity in which the cord can hang.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of the ram (animal) and put into it the humidity with which you wish to cleanse the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie it between two cords with a strong knot and warm the humidity slightly over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then introduce the end of the clyster (enema) into a rod; afterwards press your hand upon the bladder with the proper amount of humidity until the sick person feels that the humidity has reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If, however, the bladder is not present, then take a piece of parchment (animal skin), make a circle out of it and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert a thread into those holes, as they are turned around.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then gather a circle, just like it is gathered with a mortar and pestle: after you place within it what you wish from moist substances, oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then tie it with an instrument, and do as you did with the bladder by squeezing it with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 Chapter on the Extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	 Chapter Sixty.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have already said about the types of stones, their treatment with medicines and the differences between a stone formed in the kidneys, bladder, and its signs in general; we have also mentioned the operation on a stone that is performed with the hand or cut out; and that stone which is specifically generated in the bladder; and that which is fixed in the urinary channel; and I am telling this with clear explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, a stone generated in the bladder, most often happens to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And among its signs is that urine comes out from the bladder like water in subtlety; and there appears white sand in it, and a sick person rubs his urinary channel, and labors with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then it rises, and comes out together with the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And the healing of children is easy until they reach fourteen years of age.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 And it is difficult in old people.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 But among young adults it is medium, because it is between that and the one whose stone is larger, healing is easier; and if small, its treatment is reversed.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 Therefore, when we reach treatment, it is first necessary to clean the sick person with an enema, which extracts all the feces that are in his intestines; because at times it prevents the discovery of a stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then take the sick person with his feet and shake him, move him downwards: so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder or jumps from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his loins, so that the bladder becomes completely inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If you therefore feel the stone in its place, then proceed immediately with cutting upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not come out with your touch at all, then you must clean the index finger with oil of the left hand if the sick person is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a man fully grown: and insert it into his anus, and examine it for the stone, until it is under your finger: and gently guide it towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press upon it with your finger, and push it out towards the outside against the place of its incision: and command the attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another attendant, to pull up the testicles with his right hand to the upper part: and with his left hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a spatula like this:
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find it where it is between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, on the left side of the boy: and make the incision over the stone, and your finger should be in the anus: and make the incision transverse, so that the incision is wider outside, and narrower inside, according to the amount by which the stone's exit from it is not larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 Perhaps the finger presses the stone that is in the anus at the incision, and comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that, because it is from a Stone which has angles and edges, its extraction becomes difficult due to that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And it is soft, like a gland, and round; therefore, its removal becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 To him who has angles and edges, add (a tool) into the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not come out in that way, then it is necessary to apply force upon it; or to tie it well when dealt with properly, the end of which should be like the moon, which ties around the stone and does not escape from there; or to insert a delicate instrument under it, having a curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If you cannot apply force upon it, then widen the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If it resists you in some way with blood, cut it off with a cautery.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 If the stone is larger than one, then push first a large one towards the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Then push a small one after that; and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, then ignorance is to cut above it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Because it happens to the sick one either with one of two things, that he dies or there is continuous urine discharge; therefore, because the place is not consolidated at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 But administer its expulsion until it comes out; or apply force upon its fracture with levers, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with turpentine, aloe, and dragon's blood; tie it up and place upon it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water; so that an abscess may be set hot.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then turn the sick one on his back upon his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When therefore you dissolve it (the substance), anoint the place with rose water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the ointment of dyafinicon and the ointment of basilicon until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If however a hot abscess occurs in the wound, add corrosives and similar substances: as when blood congeals in the bladder and urine is prevented from passing; it is known by the passage of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Insert therefore your finger into the wound and draw out that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if it remains (the congealed blood), it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then clean the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply against it every remedy that is suitable for its healing, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And it is necessary in the entire course of treatment, that you tie together both thighs and bind them, due to the reason that medicaments which are placed upon the place must be kept warm.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and it is in the neck of the bladder and it is struck (with an instrument) and the urine output is prevented: then care for it with what I have previously mentioned before you reach the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For often, after this treatment, you will be removed from the incision, since I have now proven it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And you are to take the Perforatorium from iron ladle, whose shape is triangular at one end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take thread and tie it to the bladder stick beneath the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the perforating iron into the bladder stick with ease until the Perforator reaches the stone; and turn the Perforator by hand in the very same stone gradually; and you will make the perforation of it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 Urine is released immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on the remaining stone from the outside part of the vein.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 For it breaks and is expelled with the urine, and the sick person recovers.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If this treatment is not prepared for you for some reason that prevents it: then tie a string under the stone, and another string above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut across the vein over the stone between two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then draw it out (the stone).
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Next, untie the ligature, and clean the frozen blood that forms at the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to tie a string under the stone unless it does not return to the bladder: and tie another ligature above, unless when the string below is cut after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and for that reason it is necessary for you to lift the skin above when you tie the upper string, so that it rises towards the surface, and returns to its original position, and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 Chapter on the extraction of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 A small number of stones are formed in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If a stone happens to one of them (women), then the treatment is difficult and forbidden because it involves many modes (steps).
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One such case is that the woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And secondly, because you will not find a woman who reveals herself to the doctor when she is chaste or married.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 Thirdly, because you cannot find a woman well-versed in this art, especially in the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 Fourthly, the distance from the place of the stone: why it requires deep incision and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If necessity compels [you], then it is necessary that you take a woman physician, well-versed: and she is scarcely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If you lack that [woman physician], then seek a chaste and skillful physician, and ask for a woman midwife who is well-versed in women's matters or a woman who knows the art in part: make her present, especially instructing her to do everything as you order regarding the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 Firstly, that it is to examine if a woman is a virgin: then it is necessary for the finger to be inserted into her anus and the stone to be sought.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If it is found, twist it with his finger and then order the midwife to insert her finger into the weak opening and seek for the stone after she places her left hand on the bladder and presses it well with good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If the stone is found, then it is necessary to move it gradually from the bladder opening towards the lower part with the utmost care until it reaches its root at the hip bone.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then cut above it at the opposition of the middle part of the bladder near the root of the hip bone, wherever it is prepared for him, and he feels the stone in that part: and his finger should not be moved from the stone, twisting under it: and let the incision be small in the beginning.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then insert the probe over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If he feels the stone, then let him enlarge the incision according to its size as the stone comes out from there.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know, that the shapes of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 From this, it is small and large, smooth and rough, long and round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Therefore know its shape, so that it may be indicated to you concerning the one you want.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood overcomes you (affects you), then add at the place zegi powder and hold it for an hour until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and make sure that you prepare yourself with the instruments that I have mentioned for the removal of stones in men, in order to help you during the operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If the flow of blood overcomes you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an incised artery: then place powder on the spot and tie it with suitable ligatures; do not move that, and leave the stone alone, do not remove it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps a weak woman may die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When the sharpness of blood subsides after days and the place becomes rotten, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 Chapter: On the Section of a Watery Hernia.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A watery boil is not anything other than a gathering of moisture in the albuco of white scrotum, which contains an egg; and it is called albuco.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is in the skin itself which nature has prepared for itself in the part of the egg, until it becomes ripe; this is another egg, and it is between the white scrotum and the testicle skin, as we said; and such a thing does not happen frequently.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 And indeed the generation of this [watery boil] is from a weakness that happens to testicles; therefore this matter flows towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it occurs from striking upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 For indeed it is either of a yellowish decline, or red and blood-like, or dark and foul, black, or watery white; and this is what is more common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And the signs by which it can be known where there is a gathering of water are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 For if it is in the white scrotum which we said, then the boil is round and somewhat long like the figure of an egg; and the testicle does not appear because moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if the moisture is in its own skin, then the boil is round with a part of the egg; and for this reason man crushes himself because it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it falls under suspicion.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 When one wishes to know the color of the moisture, then to examine the color of the moisture in a boil with a square probe, whose shape has been described previously.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to that which emerges from the trace of the probe, judge about that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you command the sick man, if it is possible for him, to be bled; and observe his body full [of blood].
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then he lies down on his back on a somewhat high surface, and put many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you sit on the left side of him, and command the servant to sit on his right, who will stretch out his staff to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the bladder.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a spatula wide, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle in length, up to the groin: and make the incision according to the straight line that divides the skin of the testicles, until you reach the white part enclosing it (the cord): and scrape it off and observe it, or take care not to cut it off: and your scraping should be on the side that hangs more with the egg: and scrutinize carefully with the scraping according to how much you are able.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then pierce the cord filled with water by a large hole, and drain out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with tweezers, and stretch the cord upwards without touching the skin of the testicles enclosing it: and cut the cord in any way you can, either completely or partially, especially on its subtle side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not examine carefully, there will not be safety in the incision lest the water return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 If however an egg comes out from its skin during your operation: then when you finish the incision of the cord, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then gather together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it as other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If you find a rotten egg from blackness of some other kind, then it is necessary to tie vessels that support it, fearing bleeding.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then cut off the testicle with the suspender, and remove the egg; afterwards take care of it as previously mentioned.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If water is found in two parts, then you shall know that there are two branches; therefore cut the other part equally as you did in the other one.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 If it appears to you that the operation should be one, then do so; afterwards remove blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 Insert a submerged wool in oil or rose oil; and place another wool outside which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and examine the intestines; and place double cloths on top, and there are lice; and tie them above with a ligament that has six knots according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then two cloths are taken, washed and filled with carmin; their ends are pressed with wax or wet wool; they are tied together with a bandage in the loins; one end is placed on the anus up to the back, and the other on the neck part; the two ends below are placed on the two thighs, and the other two ends on the two groins; and the bandage is gathered in the loins of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And at times this branch is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of section with iron; it is such that you take a small cautery knife and cut the skin of the testicles with it; it is ignited as previously mentioned until it exposes the white matter containing water; then take the cautery, following this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 It resembles Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then perforate it with that, and let it burn until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then stretch the sifac with forceps and scrape it with a small hot cautery, and cut into it as much as possible, until you completely excise it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 Do not let fire touch the egg.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is safer, more distant from bleeding, and better than the operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If, however, it causes you a contradiction at the hour of incision, or at the hour of cauterization, an abscess becomes hot, or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary that you care for what causes the contradiction from it, with the treatment that suits it, according to what has been mentioned.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If, however, the patient is afraid and does not wait for this operation because of its horror: then administer a perforation as I tell you that it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are informed by that which we said about the meanings, that the purgative is watery: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then perforate the abscess at the lower part of it with a broad lancet; and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until it drains all the water.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place a warm cloth on the spot; and bind it, and allow it to drain the remaining water; then care for it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If, however, the contradiction is in the exit of water at the hour when you perforate it; and it is not this only because a white membrane causes the contradiction in the opening of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of hydropic sores is extracted, whose shape preceded; or add a little in the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or approximately those.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 When it accumulates, then it is to be purged in the same way, and the patient passes his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 On the care of fleshy roots.
Caput LXIII.	 In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that, in a section upon this Ramic [bone], there is, due to fear, often leading to danger in various dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore it seems to me that its release [of the bone] would be beneficial from this [position].
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I remember the operation therein, and the appearance of the fistula.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 I say therefore that many fistulas occur in the body, from which the testicles are formed, and this happens for various reasons, such as...
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or through an excessive, sharp or acid substance that flows to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the fistula's color is according to the body's color, and it does not have pain; and it is a heavy fistula.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 Perhaps it is a stone fistula whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it occurs through a swelling of the arteries and their inflation, as already mentioned in its remembrance; or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 What then is from these through inflation of the arteries, is known by the arrangement of the fistula, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And one should not touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 However, that which occurs through the inflation of veins does not disperse anything from it upon compression with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And now it is possible for a section to be made on this appearance, and over the remaining flesh; and there is, so that the skin of the testicles may be severed.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then stretch the egg upward and remove it along with its sifach [sack] of white; and release the suspenders from the scrotum, and bind the scrotum; and cut the suspender after you have released it from every part from the parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If the egg is solidified with those born [testicles], then it should be drawn out and cut.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is adhesion between something from the intestine, or within what is between vessels: then it is necessary to release the entire adhesion and to make an incision in a circular fashion.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 If it is a birth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind (it): then it is necessary to make an incision over the entire thing and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; afterwards take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 Chapter on the Care of Branches which are with respect to the Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIV (64).
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 A tumor resembling a bunch of grapes is an aposteme enclosed by a certain enclosure, with the softness of testicles; it becomes difficult to move and exercise, and walking on it is hard.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in its treatment, there is fear due to the memory of that which preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 But we must say that the operation should be done as the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 I therefore say that it is necessary to make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then press the girdle of the testicles downward.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, and with vessels that are near the staff; let another servant hold it, and stretch it by a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then make an incision with a broad, sharp knife cut across the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then scrape away from every side, as I told you in extracting arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Afterward insert an awl with a double thread into them, and bind it at the first places where vines occur; then bind it again at the end of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut it in half at the midpoint along the length of the body, and extract what accumulates from corrupted foul humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then treat the wound along with other wounds where pus is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles fall out.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 For it is not evil through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If, however, the vein occurs in all vessels, then they should be extracted for this reason: so that the testicles are not deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and it rottens or burns, and is no help with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 Chapter on the care of intestines.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The passage of this intestine occurs from a cut which happens on the stomach extended over the inguinal part of the bladder from the right side of the abdomen.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the bladder or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 And these two types occur from many causes: either by blow, jump, shouting, lifting a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the sign is when it is due to the extension of the bladder.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It happens gradually over a long time and does not occur suddenly; it is an abscess equal to the deep-seated swelling because the bladder compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And the sign of it is when it is due to a cut in the bladder because it causes a sudden intense pain at the beginning; and it is an abscess different, appearing near the skin; and that is due to the exit of the intestine and its flow to the outside of the bladder.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it comes out with the yolk-like substance; and this is called the intestinal ramus and the yolk; and sometimes it occurs with fecal discharge.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes fecal matter runs into the intestine and is retained there; and it is with danger for the sick, because it causes great pain, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in the treatment of this type of illness with iron there is fear; therefore, one must be careful about any mishap during it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 The method of the operation is that you order the sick person to bring their intestine back with their own hand into the hollow of their cavity, if they obey the command.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then it will be laid on its back over its neck between your hands; and lift up its legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then extend the skin following the skin upward, and cut the entire skin of the scrotum along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then fix the scissors in two lips of the incision, according to what you need for opening the incision with them; and let the cut be according to the quantity, so that it is possible for the egg to come out from there.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the scrotum, and what is under the skin of the testicles until the white siphac is exposed, hard from all sides; then insert your thumb into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white siphac, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the siphacs and without the adhesion to the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move with the right hand to the internal skin of the testicles; and at the same time stretch the white siphac upwards with the left hand; and lift the egg along with the siphac to the part of the incision; and order the servant to extend the egg upward; and you solve the adhesion, which is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And examine with your fingers if there is nothing there from the intestine rolled up in the hard white siphac.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If you find anything from it, then push it down towards the lower stomach.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take the hook having a thick thread made of linen from ten threads, and insert it near the last sifach, that is, the tunica, which follows the skin of the testicles after section: then cut off the protruding ends until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Compose some of them over some with a figure in the form of a cross and tie it with alsifach, which we have mentioned, as it is the strong ligament under the skin of the testicles, until no fluid from the vessels that nourish them can pass through to them; so that a hot abscess does not occur there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place again the ligament beyond the first ligament, at least two fingers away.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligaments release from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity equal to the size of a digit: and cut the rest in a round shape and remove the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut off the skin of the lower part of the testicles with a section where blood and pus run, as we have said in that which was mentioned previously.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound and place a ligament as we have said.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes cauterize the white sifach that we have mentioned after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 This often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And release the ligament until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If the case does not heal quickly, then embrocate with hot water: and place over it what we have said until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then care for the wound with the usual treatment of wounds until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 Chapter on the inflamed ramica (the scrotum).
Caput LXVI.	 Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this Ramic case, I saw no one who dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And as we previously stated, the same thing occurs in a Ramic case that is found among fig trees.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 That is, to tie vessels after section on it with ease from below; then cut in the middle, and afterwards treat it with what opens it up itself, until the vessels fall out: and treat the wound, as we said before, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 Chapter on Dislocation that occurs in groins.
Caput LXVII.	 Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the site is evident and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is of little consequence and returns in all hours: but if it continues for a time, a tear is added in the scrotum until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And this happens from the extension of the scrotum, which is in the groins, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 Because the scrotum is extended: then it is softened, and the site is loosened, and it protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 The treatment of this is with a cautery, as its narrative has previously stated.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And at times it is treated with iron in this manner: and it is as if the weak one lies on his back upon your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut the site of the rupture and protrusion, with a cut in width, according to the length of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then tie the scrotum and what is beneath the skin until the white membrane that follows the scrotum is exposed.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take the rod and place it over the protruding site from the scrotum and press it into the deep abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then cut two protrusions at the end of the radius from the scrotum and sew them together with a suture: then extract the end of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor pull the testicle, nor anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of the intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then treat this with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 When you make sutures, clean it, and restore the wound until it is solidified.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 The scrotum contracts and no more protrusion of rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 The cautery is better in this case, because it is closer to salvation.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 On the softening of the scrotal skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 Many times the scrotal skin is softened in certain men, on account of which the flesh between them becomes soft, and its appearance is made ugly.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary for him who is asked to cure it, that he makes the weak one lie on his back and cuts through all the softened skin over the normal skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then he brings together the two folds with suture: and if you wish, or rather excess of softened skin, three sutures, or four, and a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then care for the healing of the other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	 Chapter on castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Know that castration is forbidden by our law: and on account of this it would be permissible for me not to mention it in my book; and its mention is not necessary, unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One reason is that this should be known to a physician when he is asked about it; and so that he may know the cure for him whom it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And another method is that we often need castration of certain animals, for our use from it, such as sheep, goats, and cats, and similar ones from the animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore, that castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by splitting and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 But in that which is done by attrition, the way of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and become limp and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer noticeable under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In castration by splitting and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then tie the suspender and cut above all the egg on one section until when two eggs come out: then cut where each of them has been shelled and do not leave anything beyond the shell except the shell which is on the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than that by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something from the testicles, therefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Chapter on the treatment of Hermaphroditus in two methods.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 Hermaphroditus is from men according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is because there is a space or skin of the testicles where it is between two testicles, with a female-like figure, in which hair grows; and sometimes it runs urine from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 But in women there is one species and it is a small female figure on the ridge like the small testicles of a man projecting to the outside; one of them is like a priapus of a man, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the cure of three kinds, two from men, and one from women, is: because it is necessary to make incisions in the added flesh, until the impression of them escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then, the treatment for these wounds is the treatment of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 Moreover, in the second kind from men, from which urine comes out, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is any cure for it at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 § On the incision of tentigo and protruding flesh on women's ulcers.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 Tentigo may be added supernaturally, until it becomes foul and ugly to look at; and sometimes it is greatly enlarged in certain women so much that it expands like in men and reaches coitus.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hold back the excess of tentigo with the hand or with a pair of scissors and to make an incision; not to the end in the incision, especially in the deep roots, lest there be bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then, it is cured by treating the wound itself until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 Flesh that comes out is the flesh that is born in the opening of the matrix, until it fills itself; and possibly it goes out to the exterior like the tail, and therefore some call the illness 'caudate'.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it is necessary to make an incision in it as we do with tentigo and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 § On the treatment of alratic ulcer, which is a woman's unperforated ulcer.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 Alratic ulcer is an ulcer in a woman which is not perforated or has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it may be natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 Accidental ulcer is caused by an illness that has preceded it; and this ulcer itself may be formed from added flesh, or subcutaneous tissue, or from the spissus; and it may be in the deep of the matrix, or its sides, or on top of it, or below it; and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and possibly menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 The recognition (of it) is made by the obstetrician's observation, if the opening is apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the opening is from the scrotum (sifach) fine and near two lips (labia): then approach it, and tear it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And (it is) so that you place small pieces on the two lips (labia).
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then put your thumbs of both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then spread the two lips forcefully until the fine scrotum (sifach) tears and the opening is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take wool, and dip it in oil, and put it on the place: let the woman do this every day so that the place does not heal over with something else.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If the scrotum (sifach) is thick and swollen: then it is necessary to cut it with a broad-bladed instrument like a leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the opening is from flesh born (fistula), then suspend it with hooks and cut it: and have medicines that stop the flow of blood without bleeding, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and pitch mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a wide cannula made of lead to prevent the wound from healing quickly, hold it for several days: then administer linen cloth, dry it, then care for the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And sometimes a birth of flesh from other places occurs in the womb (matrix): it is necessary therefore to cut them according to this method: until it is not a cancerous boil, because a cancerous boil that is in the matrix should not be opposed to iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on the treatment of piles (hemorrhoids), by Athaehelil and Botheor for women.
Caput LXXIII.	 Head LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood continuously flows out from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 When hemorrhoids become ancient, they become piles: and I have already said in the division of their kinds, and the signs of them; and here I will say what receives treatment from them, and what does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment with iron for him.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those which are on the opening of the womb above which falls the sense, are those that can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then extend the pile with forceps or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then sprinkle powder over them in the flow of blood from one incision without biting: such as alum, dragon's blood, asafoetida and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then push his feet against the wall at the hour of one o'clock.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Then lay her down in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and the rind of pomegranates, and walnuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, and knead it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If the blood is cut off with it, that is good; and if not, make adhesive windbags and breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarathith, or the juice of arnoglossum, or the juice of branches of aaloulat, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and make it adhesive on the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When therefore an aposteme is quieted, then care for the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 The Albarth (pustule) is similar to red scalps of al-hawassa, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore it is necessary to cut what appears from it, as I said in thelil equally; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 Chapter on Perforation of the Afterbirth that occurs in the Womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXIIII (72)
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 Various appearances of abscesses occur in the matrix, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, boils, herpes, scabs, fistulas, hemorrhoids, ragadias, thelils, and warm abscesses.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And I myself have already said all these diseases and their appearances, their signs, and their treatments are divided: it is necessary that in this treatise I say about the warm abscess occurring in the matrix, which is one of those abscesses that collect pus, and to know how its opening with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, you should consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 If the pain of the abscess at its onset is sharp with impact, and burning sensation, and fever; and you see it reddening, if it falls upon the sense; then do not hurry with its perforation: and cure it with what helps for its maturation until the acuteness ceases.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a chair with two arms, and recline or lean against her back, and gather her feet to the lower part of the abdomen; and her thighs should be spread apart, and she places her arms under her knees, and tie both together with a suitable ligament.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the tool for opening the matrix.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 The shape comes in those that follow.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is necessary that when you wish to administer this tool, you mark with a deep rod the depth of the woman's matrix so that what enters from the instrument is not greater than the depth of the matrix and injure the weak one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the tool is larger than the depth, then it is necessary that you place pins on the cover of the depth of the matrix to prevent the entire instrument from entering into the depth of the matrix; and it is necessary that you place a rotating wheel on the upper side which holds the instrument and turns the minister wheel until the depth of the matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When it appears to be excised and is touched with the hand, and it is soft and tender: then it should be cut off at its head with a broad lancet.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When pus is evacuated, then it should be placed in the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, in which there is some styptic substance: and place the linen cloth, and extract the incision deeply into the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 Place it externally over the matrix and on top of the comb, a clean wool soaked in water in which malvae have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment suitable for that, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the matrix and wound are washed, so that they are cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the asafetida or long aristolochia has been boiled: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden inside the matrix, then it should be forbidden to treat it with iron, rather it should be treated with what I have said in the section on cauterization.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Chapter on obstetrics: how to treat living embryos that have been expelled abnormally.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter LXXXVI (86)
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for the obstetrician to first recognize the shape of a normal birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 Therefore, among the signs of this is that when you see a woman compressing towards the lower parts and desires to smell the air, and there is an urge to urinate over her as she is in labor, and she hastens the delivery of the embryo: then know that this birth is according to its natural shape, and it exits over the head and follows with it or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 If you see these signs, then the abdomen of her should be pressed to hasten the delivery of the embryo.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 When it descends upon his head, the second one also descends with it, and it is cleaned from those superfluities with a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But that which is beyond this birth is unnatural, unpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 For sometimes the fetus comes out with its feet first, and its body comes out before its head, and one of its feet or hand: or its head and one hand come out: or a belly comes out, and perhaps it turns over onto its neck, and similar unpraiseworthy shapes.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore it is necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent, skilled in all matters, and take care to avoid error and deception: and I show every figure of them, and how there is skill in it, and it is indicated by that, and it will stand above it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus comes out with its head in its natural delivery and becomes violent upon the woman and the delivery becomes difficult, and you see its strength already weakened: then have her sit on a chair, or women hold her: and heat up her belly with warm fennel water and moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the obstetrician introduces a small spatula between her fingers and separates the second one with it, and cuts it off with his nail until it flows from its moistness: and press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If it does not descend, then it is necessary to cleanse the woman with fennel mucilage and sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then command her after the cleansing to be pressed: and make her sneeze with pepper, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus come out first, you must pull them back gently and gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If (the patient) does not obey upon entering, then place the woman on a seat, and lift her feet upwards; then knock the seat on the ground; the woman must be held so that she does not fall during the blow.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies: then cut (the womb), and extract the remaining fetus; and tie the hand with cloth, and extract it equally; for it will come out by itself.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 Exit of the embryo above its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus comes out above its feet, then it should be pushed upwards; afterwards turn it gradually; finally equalize it (the position of the feet with the rest of the body).
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of his feet and stretch it out slowly.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they come out up to the hips, then command him (the patient) to press and make her sneeze with a blow; for it will come out if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not come out as we have said, then gradually bring the fetus back until you place it in a natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For it will come out then with an easy delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If it is forbidden as we have said (to perform the previous operation): then take some mastic gum, oil of sesame, and dissolved gum; and crush everything together in a mortar with good blows; afterwards smear the woman's womb with it and apply it below her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then let her sit in warm water until she becomes accustomed to it (the water).
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that her lower parts have become warm, then give her a sip of myrrh and place it (the myrrh) under her.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When an hour has passed since she drank the myrrh, then let her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeze; and pinch her mouth and nose; and press the lower part of her belly gently.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 The fever will immediately exit.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 The exit of the fetus is above the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it exits according to this shape, then he (the midwife) should insert his hands slowly.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman will lie on her back with her head down and her feet raised; she should be lying on the bed and clasp her hands together.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press gradually over the abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then draw out what is below her feet from the anus, until it is prepared at the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the fetus does not exit, then grab his feet and move them forcefully.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press gradually what is above the pelvis until the fetus rises to higher parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then insert his hands and press the fetus gradually; and command the woman to compress herself until the fetus exits.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 The exit of the fetus is hanging sideways from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 He (the midwife) should insert his hand (to help guide the fetus).
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If she cannot be guided, then turn the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 If she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed; and strike her legs with strong blows.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply the ointment that you have prepared from resins.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 If she receives delivery, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then strive to guide the hand, and press the fetus according to its natural shape; and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself until it exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The exit of the fetus is on its own head, with arms spread out, and its face towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The midwife must hold the baby's hand, then turn it gradually and gently guide it.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it [the wound] is equal [healed], then place upon it what we have previously mentioned from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then command him to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that [applied the ointment], then make her sit on a chair and command her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then command him to be pressed: and make her sneeze with pepper.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 Delivery of the fetus prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it [the fetus] descends to the opening of the matrix in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is expelled due to moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the fetus is suspended on its face and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus into the interior until you place it as necessary: and command the woman to press herself several times; for it will exit with a gentle passage.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins often give birth and sometimes three and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, that is unusual and rarely occurs.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 But five is a thing outside nature and they do not live completely; and it contains them, although the afterbirth is one for all of them; and they are separated by seifach, which distinguishes between them bound at the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they exit like a fetus exits with a natural and easy passage, and they exit with an unutterable passage as we have said.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult during childbirth and they reach what we have said with unnatural figures, then care for them as we have said: and let it be a subtle midwife, and let her do what she does with facility and slowness, and adapt herself to every figure with that which is prepared for her according to her ingenuity leading to safety.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Remember that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and they are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it is confirmed among me that a woman has expelled seven and another fifteen, all of which were formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 What was done by the measurement of the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, this entire matter should be in the knowledge of the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 Perhaps it will reach that one which is similar to his: offer him then what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you care for a dead fetus with what I said in the division of medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman is healthy in virtues, and there is no accident that causes fear of loss over her: then she should be made to lie on a bed, face down, with her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised: and a servant should hold her from two sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body does not come out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then wet the mouth of the womb with moist oils such as olive oil, marshmallow (althea), fenugreek and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the obstetrician should wet his hand with these oils and mucilages, then insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then he should look for a place where he can hook the forceps from the fetus, and places suitable for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Therefore, consider then if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then hook the forceps in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its arm pits, or near the ribs and under the hypocondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If there is a descent on his feet, then make an incision in the chest and in the middle of his ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary that he holds the hook with his right hand, and places the sore on that which is between the fingers of the left hand; and introduces (it) with his hand easily, and presses the hook into one of those places which we have said, until it reaches a hollow place.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then press another hook or the third one if necessary, to make the contraction equal and not bend towards any side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then stretch it with an equal extension and not only along the straight direction, but move it to all sides to relieve its outlet; just as is done with a tooth when extracting it.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 It is necessary that the extension (be) softened in what is between them (the hooks).
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 And if a part is retained within it, then the midwife must insert certain fingers with oil into that place, to turn (the hook) with them which is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If a part of the child comes out, then change the hooks to another higher place; do this until the whole child comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If a hand comes out before the other (parts) and it is not possible to return it because of its swelling, then cover it with a cloth.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then remove (it) until when the whole comes out, cut (the cloth) at its joint of the foot or elbow; and you must do this in both hands and feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If the head of the child is large or there is swelling at its outlet, or water has accumulated on it; then insert a pointed probe between his fingers and crush (the skull) with it, and draw out the water; or tear it apart with an instrument called Almisdac, whose shape comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Likewise, if the fetus has a large head by nature, then it is necessary to cut through the membrane: or pull it out with forceps, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then draw the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head emerges and becomes stuck at the neck, then it is split open until the moisture within the chest is expelled.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 But if it does not swell or obey to emerge: then cut the head roughly, as far as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If there is a tumor below the abdomen or it has hydropsy within it: then it must be pierced until the moisture runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 If the fetus is positioned above its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the maternal bone is simple.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If it becomes stuck in the abdomen or chest: then it must be pulled out with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand, and open the abdomen or chest until what is inside runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If the rest of the limbs are removed and the head returns: then the midwife shall insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the maternal bone is open, then insert your hand deep into the mother's cavity and seek the head with it, and pull it out with your fingers up to the maternal bone: then insert a hook or hooks and pull it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the maternal bone is stuck due to a hot tumor that has occurred there: then it is not appropriate to strain on it, but rather administer an effusion of moist substances and ointments, and sit in water that softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is on its side, it may be equalized: then administer what has been said for a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If it is not possible to do that, then make a series of shallow cuts and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And it is necessary that you leave nothing inside the second incision at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 When you have completed your operation, then administer what was said about hot boils that occur in the uterus.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If there is a flow of blood, then go down into warm water, and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 I myself have seen a woman whose womb had a dead fetus; then she became pregnant again on top of it, and afterwards another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 After a long time, an abscess appeared on her navel, which became swollen until it burst, and began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 Therefore I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 I therefore applied certain strong adhesives on it; and bone came out of the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then several days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I was amazed then, since there is no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 Therefore I thought, because the dead fetuses were made of bones.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I therefore asked for the wound, and extracted many bones from it, while the woman was in her best physical condition; and she lived in this way for a long time, and emitted only a little pus.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 And I did not hold this foreign object here unless there is knowledge and assistance for that which the medical artist administers with his hand during treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 Chapter on the shapes of essential instruments needed for fetus extraction.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Below is the shape of a Clamp, which equalizes books, having two equally positioned screws at the ends of two wooden pieces.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 The vertigo should be more delicate with a strap; and it can be made so, either from ebony or from balsa wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 The width of all the wooden parts should be about two fingers; and the edge of each is like one finger, and the length of each is a palm and half; and in the middle of the two wooden parts are two additions of the same kind of wood which are already fixed in both, whose length is half a palm and less; and the width of each is about two fingers or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 These two additions are inserted into the hinge, so that it opens with them when you rotate the two vertigos.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of the vertigo which opens the hinge.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form similar to this, but more delicate and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 It should be made from ebony or balsa wood, according to the shape of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 However, at the end of it, there should be two additions as you see here above; and the length of all the additions from these is about a palm; and the width of each is about two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 When you want to open the hinge with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, with her legs apart; and open what is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two additions together into the vagina; and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with forceps, equally according to the size of opening of the vagina that you want; until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 The form of another vertigo different from those described by the ancients, namely the impeller, by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The form of Almisdaq, by which the large head is crushed; it resembles forceps with teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it happens that it is a forceps of this shape, as you see, which has teeth like those of a saw, with which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The form of Albucasis by which a small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The form of the scoop having one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The form of the scoop having two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The shape of a forceps with saw-like teeth, by which a fetal head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The shape of the spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The shape of two broad spatulas as well.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 All these instruments are exercised, and the more their species multiply, and they are prepared by craftsmen, it is quicker for their operation, and higher among men, due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not despise from them an instrument, which should be prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 Indeed, the necessity of them is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Chapter on the second extraction (childbirth).
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the Afterbirth (Secundina) is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary to order the weak woman to retain her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with snuff: and press your hand over her mouth, and her own nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If therefore it exits through this (method), it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not: then take the pot and make a hole in the covering; and put in it herbs opening the womb, such as camomile, rue, anise, chamomile, wild carrot wood, centaurium, and hops: take all these herbs or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place the arrowhead of an reed over the hole of the pot's covering, and another end into the womb: and hold it until the vapor reaches the hollow of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze, as we said before.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For the Afterbirth will go out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If it remains after this treatment and does not go out: then order the Midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil or marsh-mallow root.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then insert (it) into the womb and search for the Afterbirth with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When you find it, then take it and slowly unfold it.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If it is attached deep within the womb, then insert the hand as we described earlier, until when you find the Afterbirth and pull it out slowly according to right direction so that it does not fall from the uterus due to violent attraction: rather, it should be moved easily from side to side: after that, add more to the amount of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 For then it will obey, and be saved, and go away from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 If the bone of the matrix is dislocated, as we have already said: treat it with stimulation, and with medication from an oil pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 If it does not come out as we have said, then beware not to tire yourself with the repetition of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 However, it is necessary that what comes out towards the bone of the matrix from there, you tie it to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then, clisterize her with the four-ingredient ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 For it will rot her after days, and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, when it rots, raise the smell of foulness to her stomach and head, and damage that weak part.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, they should administer suitable fumigations for that purpose.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already been experienced with fumigation using nasturtium and figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The shape of the instrument used for fumigation during the retention of the second birth and periods.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make it similar to an alms basin or a dish; and place its broad end over the fire; let the fumigation be placed on plums; hold it until that fumigation is consumed; then repeat another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 Chapter on the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born, and their anus are not perforated, whom a subtle siphak has already cauterized.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, the midwife must perforate that siphak with her finger; and if she cannot, let her perforate it with the sharp spatula, and let her be careful not to touch the muscle.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place upon him a linen cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If one fears that he will burst, then place a lead pipe into the opening for many days, and let it be removed when the boy wishes to pass urine.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 Moreover, anus bursting also happens due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, that consolidation must be cut, then treated with what I have said concerning healing and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 Chapter on the treatment of fistulas occurring in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodation and swelling that happen near the anus outside; or in a space of one part; and there is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 When that nodation becomes old, it opens up, and watery liquid white or subtle pus runs out of it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes these fistulas penetrate.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, penetrating fistulas are recognized by the evacuation and wind that occurs when one uses the bowels in an unhealthy manner; and possibly a worm may come out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And these fistulas are when they penetrate into the space up to the bladder, and up to the root of the penis.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And these fistulas penetrate up to the junction of the hip, and up to the node of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 The fistula that is recognized as penetrating the anus can also be known if you insert your index finger into the anus; and insert a probe of thin metal or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is a twist [in the surgical site], then introduce into it a thin probe made of lead or a horsehair [bundle], until you feel the probe, or a hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it completely, and nothing is expelled from the incision or a gas discharge or worms as I said: then you will know that it is impenetrable; therefore proceed to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the Fistula (tube) penetrates to the bladder or the meat of urine: then its sign is the discharge of urine from it, and the prevention of it by this means that the location should be made firm with medicine.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 But if it penetrates to the joint of the hip or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches it, if there is no twist up to the bone; and the finding of pain around the part, and that pus always discharges from it; and that medicine does not work in it, nor does it become firm with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and the treatment of them is labor and futility for him, over whom it is formed [the disease], from foolish physicians.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 In the one which is not penetrating, and not ancient, hope of healing with a knife; according to what I tell you, and I have already proven: and it is, that it lies weak under your hands on its back; and lift its legs up to its own hips, and its hips should be inclined towards the abdomen of itself.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then introduce a probe made of lead or air, if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where the probe has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 But if the weak person feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you introduce your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If therefore you feel that it has already pierced through your finger by itself, which is evident to you, and you also feel something between the finger and the bone or flesh: then you will certainly know that it penetrates; do not labor on it, because there is no healing in it, as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They say that the flesh heals in some people and there is benefit from the medication applied to it, so heat a cautery of fine size according to the width of the fistula, as mentioned before, and introduce it into the fistula while burning until it reaches the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then do this twice or three times until you know that all the added flesh surrounding it, which is similar to a bird's feather pen, has been burned off.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then treat it with linen bandages soaked in butter until the burned flesh comes out; then treat it with ointments that generate and solidify skin.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 If it emerges and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or bone between the piercing and the wound: and you see that the fistula follows the skin surface; then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula and you cut with the piercing as it goes into the fistula until the incision reaches where the tip of the piercing ends, and the piercing is released and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean the burned flesh that resembles a bird's feather quill, so that nothing remains from it.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If blood defeats you and dissolves the flesh between you and your operation so that the burned flesh remains: then it is better to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Since cautery with fire brings good conditions, burning of those added tissues, removal of blood and drying up of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then treat that with swaddled linens in butter, or boiled leeks, until the place emits pus, and the burned tissues come out into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then treat the wound with hardening ointments, which produce tough flesh; there are some medicines that contain styptic and drying agents.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when it is being healed, then it is already healed; do not fear repeated treatments.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 If the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus and extends beyond the body's excess: then insert your finger into the anus and examine it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 If you feel a tentative swelling, and there is a membrane of sheep's skin or flesh between you and it, and it is near to penetrating: then the operation should not be performed on it, unless it is done by way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 That is because one of three methods is administered in it: either to cauterize the very thing itself, as we have said; or to excise it until you follow the concavity of it, so that it may be possible for you to insert linens and treatment from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed much with the excision, lest you cut the muscle containing the anus, and there occurs a bad discharge of excrement without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then treat that as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 Perhaps it will heal; or stretch the membrane itself, and clean it after you have cut it near the anus, as we have said, either with a swelling or with another sharp tool at the end.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then clean those fleshy parts that are cut, until you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with a section, and at the superior part where it is consolidated: and a fistula remains open in the internal part of the anus, and it will be lighter on the weak.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes a Fistula is cauterized in this manner: and it is when you insert the probe into the Fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus: then take a perforated probe, which is like an aleskef, that is, prepared leather, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a rolled thread of five strands, and about that size.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the probe with the thread into the Fistula until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it penetrates into the internal margin of the anus, then remove the thread from that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus and withdraw the end of the thread, and tie both ends together: and tighten each one and leave it for one or two days: and as much as the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those tissues that are between the two ends of the thread fall off and fall away: then care for the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If, however, the opening of the Fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrable in any way that you can prepare yourself, except if it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For you do not have the ability to do this for the sake of the arm, so as not to cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then do as I said until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The shape of the Spatulis spini for finding a Fistula, whose sharpness is very strong and one part is not sharp, so as not to cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 On stitching hemorrhoids, from which blood flows upon their incision; and on treating fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Or they are within the anus, like black lentils or prunes; or they resemble the seeds of apples.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And some are small, and others large; and blood flows from them continually, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 Those outside the anus and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those which are outside the anus, are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows citron water or a little blood with continuous flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And the treatment of that which is within the anus, is to advise the patient to sit in warm water; and it is expressed, until it comes out of the anus, and appears to you as athelia.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, and fasten them with hooks; or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then incise them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If they cannot be held in place with hooks due to their moisture and softening; then take them with a rough cloth or a glove made of double wool, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then incise them, and sprinkle some hot powders on them after the incision, so that they remain in place with a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or cauterize them according to what was stated in the previous chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not obey excretion, then enema the patient with a little purgative enema so that he may be washed out of what is in his anus, and quickly comply with excretion when he purges himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If the athelils are external from the anus, then their condition is light and easy; it is as if you capture them with your nail, or capture them with a tweezers, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them with what I said until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And for one who shuns the incision with iron, then it is necessary to administer suture in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a rolled thread and insert it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then extract the athelil towards above and make it penetrate with the point into its root on the other side; and roll the ends of the thread around the tip of the needle, and let them be wide; and tighten the athelil strongly with a strong suture.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then knot the thread, and extract the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all the athelils, and leave one out; do not tie yourself up with it, so that excess blood may drain away from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or pitch on the anus and put it on the anus; and tell the sick man to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then release him until he falls asleep.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When the athelils fall out, take care of them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 Chapter on the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For it often happens due to removal of feces and constriction by nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 When they have become chronic and medicine does not work for them; then it is necessary to shave with punctated spatula or with your nail until they become moist, and the superficial layer which prevents consolidation is removed from them.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then take care of them until they consolidate as required.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If they do not consolidate; then repeat the treatment with a more vigorous shaving than before, until they bleed much and are opened up again; then take care of them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 "On the treatment of inverted sores, and not of normal ones: and of Athelil's wounds, and ants.
Caput LXXXII.	 "Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 "Know that Almirmar is not but a round nodule similar to the color of the body and resembling a nail head; it occurs throughout the body, particularly in the lower parts of the feet and fingers, and pain arises during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 "Therefore it should be cut off that which is around the nail, held with forceps or a tweezers, and uprooted from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 "Next, treat it thus: and if you wish to cauterize it as mentioned in the previous chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 "From Athelil's wounds, one is a small, rough, filtered outgrowth, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 "And they often occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 "And its treatment is to stretch out Athelil, and to cut it open; or to sew it with silk thread; or with hair until it falls off."\]
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 "And if you wish to cauterize it as mentioned before with fire or sharp medicine, it is now uprooted Athelil, both inverted and not inverted with the tool I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 "Formica is also a small, filtered outgrowth, coarse on the surface of the body, extending deeply; when it is found cold, it feels similar to an ant bite and occurs throughout the body; it often appears most in the hands."\]
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 "And its treatment is to take a reed from a goose's feather or a strong bird's feather; and place the reed on Formica until it forms a ring around it.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 "Next, rotate your hand with the reed until you cut off what is around Formica; and insert it deep into the flesh and uproot Formica from its root."\]
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do it with an air cannula or iron cannula, in this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Place the upper end of the cannula so that it stretches to its limit and encloses the ear, so as to soften its grasp and its return.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish, cauterize the ant in the manner described for cauterizing Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Chapter on the shapes of instruments used for enema treatment in diseases of the anus, and solutions of the stomach, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 When an enema is made of silver, or gold, or brass melted, or beaten.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes it is made with these small and large instruments, according to the ones used for administration.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore, what is administered for the treatment of small children should be small; and for those with weak or painful anus, the enema should also be small.
Clistere magnum.	 Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The upper part of the cannula, that is, where the uterus is attached, should be wide according to this method; and it should have a division so that the uterus can be tied as you see, and the lower end, which enters the anus, should be closed, that is, not open, soft, very fine, stretching to subtlety; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the ray, and less thick than a little finger, and it should contain the medicine from an animal bladder; or from the membrane of an egg, which is shaped like a small syringe: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And it should be perforated with many holes as it rotates, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into those holes a thread made of raw silk, which is from ten threads, or about that number, and bind it together like asphaltum.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When placed within the uterus, a cataplasm made of strong purge is to be tightly wound around its head with two distinct constrictions.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then apply the purgative.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the circle form here depicted and its holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of the purgative to be applied with it is as follows: fill the bladder or the bag made of medicine that has been warmed according to the tolerance of the sick person; and take care that it is not too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the sick person lies on his back and raises his legs towards the top; and place under him a sheepskin or a cloth, that is, the covering people lie upon.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the end of the purgative with oil, or with white goose grease, or with mucilage of fenugreek, or something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then the servant takes the bladder with both hands and squeezes it forcefully until everything contained within the purgative is expelled into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the purgative, and the sick person raises his legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine forces it out, then hold it as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps with this all night, it is more helpful for his recovery.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If the purgative is used on him for diseases of the abdomen and he quickly expels it; then apply the purgative again until he recovers.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or sores wounding in the anus; then the purgative should be very soft and gentle, like those used to purge children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And let this be the form of the subtle plaster for a closed wound.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 On the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Head LXXXIIII.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 In the Treatise on Wounds, as I have previously stated, it is appropriate to speak of their treatment by hand and with medicine; here, I will describe their treatment according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, wounds are distinguished according to the cause by which they occur, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Therefore, wounds are often caused by the following: a thrown stone, or a cut from a sword, or a knife; or a thrust with a spear, or wood, or an arrow; and similar occurrences of various objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that occur in different parts of the body are as follows: a wound on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or back; and similar wounds on other body parts.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I will describe the treatment of some wounds, so that I may provide reasoning and a rule for treating other wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I will begin with simple head wounds, because the composition of remedies is discussed at the beginning of Chapter Three.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When a simple head wound occurs and no bone is broken, consider whether it was caused by a thrown stone or something similar, and if only the skin has been broken; if the wound is large and there is a concern about postematic abscesses forming, then apply hot poultices immediately. Do not delay this procedure and extract from his blood according to the strength of its virtue; if nothing prohibits phlebotomy, particularly if the blood flowing from the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let phlebotomy be performed on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And be careful to avoid filling himself with food or drink of poor quality.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If something forbids a decrease (minution), then it should be reduced from food, and it should not approach flesh nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And place on the wound if it happens to have a hot abscess, boiled vinegar infused in rose oil only, or with wine in which there is a sticky substance.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If you are free from a hot abscess, then place on the wound if it is recent with its own blood and has not changed the air around it; and if the air around it has already changed, then place certain ointments on it until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the wound is large or from a sword cut and similar ones: and its edges should not be joined together by blisters, then join them with stitching, as I will tell you about in abdominal wounds regarding their stitching.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If the wound has already been exposed by bone and hangs, and there is no retention of it unless in a small suspending device: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then take care of the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh to it where the skin is, and instruct the sick person to eat coarse foods in which there is thickness, such as heads (of animals) and boiled wheat, until it becomes soft; and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 And if you find putrefaction (rot) in the skin that does not adhere to bone: then cut out the entire rotten part and throw it away; then care for it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows, and it cannot be separated by medicines, then seek over the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you find it not cut, then cut it with a spatula or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 And if necessity compels when that which was said cannot be conferred, then cauterize it until the blood separates.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If those wounds are small and simple, their condition is easy and light: in such a way that one may sprinkle upon them this powder: for it consolidates them before the air changes.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Method of applying powder to heal wounds.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime: grind it thoroughly and sieve it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it well until it adheres well to the surface, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then bind it on top with small pieces, and leave it, do not remove it until it has healed completely so that it does not open up again.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For the medicine shall not be removed from him until he is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And at times lime alone performs this function, when you do not currently have olibanum and dragon's blood as well. It also does the same operation for many large wounds, when it is to be placed upon them and bound, and the wounds are recent with their own blood which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If the air has already altered the wound through some change, particularly in the time of summer, then this powder is not suitable for it: so cure it with what I said before, by placing certain ointments upon them: or place on them poultices made from barley flour, mixed with water and honey, until pus is emitted.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then continue to treat the remaining parts until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 If it happens that the wound is a fracture of a bone, and it is small, then extract it with a forceps: and I will now say the treatment for fractures of the skull which will follow.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 Chapter on neck wounds.
Caput LXXXV.	 Head LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment compared to a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the nerve or artery of the neck has been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in its treatment except to divert the care from it, as with sinnum, zygomatic bone, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because nerves cause harm and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of nerves is cold and its continuity is with the brain, which is higher than organs; let it be treated with warm remedies such as lime mixed with sweet water several times infused with oil, or rose oil, and turpentine, when cleaned even with sweet water; and other mineral stones, according to this method, and moist unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If the wound is large, then administer suture; or apply oiled strips of linen with threads.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If the wound has depth or if a cavity occurs in its lower part, where pus accumulates, then pierce it at a deeper location in that place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If the artery has been cut in the wound and there is a flow of blood from it: then separate, or cut and tie it; or cauterize it if necessity requires it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If the trachea has been cut or the whole has been saved and larynges have been saved: then apply the lips of the skin with suture on top of the throat, and do not touch the throat; instead, lift it and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then tie it up with a suitable ligature, and let it be for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments containing styptic properties and drying agents until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has made an impression on the bone, then examine it carefully; if there are fragments of bone within it, remove them all or as many as you can; and whatever cannot be prepared at that time, let it putrefy, and allow the discharge from the wound to separate and subside.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle powder over it as I have mentioned.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If it appears that there is bone in the wound and a fistula forms: then treat it with what has been described in its respective chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Chapter on Wounds in Spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound made by a lance or knife, and its depth can be seen, then examine it carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If a wound discharges pus when the sick person is breathing heavily, then know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If the wound is not deep and is fresh with its own blood, then do not apply powder immediately or tie it up to prevent the blood from remaining deep inside and returning to the heart and killing the sick person; instead, place an attracting ointment on it and change it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If you do not have ointment at hand, then place a heated, old brick over the wound to dry out the discharge; and make the sick person lie on the wound so that what is accumulating in it can run off.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If three or more days have passed since the wound occurred and there is no spasm, no bad heart tremor, no constriction during breathing, and the other aspects of the wound appear good, then know that the wound is well.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Treat yourself and with linen cloths, and the rest of the treatment, until you are healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If it is cut open (of the wound) and healing begins again, then know that it has become a Fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Treat it from its own (source).
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and it is simple on the chest or back surface, then treat it with what came before (the first treatment) if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 If (the wound) has made an impression on the bone and cut off fragments from it: then inspect the wound, and hurry to remove those fragments if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 If they (the fragments) are not separated, then leave them until the wound rots, because it is easier to remove them when the wound has rotted.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 For other wounds caused by accidents on other limbs, the judgment for treatment is the same as we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 Chapter on Wounds of the Abdomen, and exit of the Intestines, and their exits.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 Rupture that happens to the abdomen is great, middle, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 From a great rupture, it sometimes exits the intestine, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Therefore, their introduction and sewing is forced and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 A small rupture is also difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore, its reduction is more difficult if you do not hurry to introduce it to its place immediately; because it swells, opens up, and becomes enlarged; which makes the entry more difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore, a medium rupture is better because when it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is more difficult in these two types (great and small).
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 You should know that stitching of the vein is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two stitches commonly join in the stitching of the abdomen, and in the stitching of other wounds on the body; and two other stitches properly belong to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 Nevertheless, they are more proper for the stitching of the abdomen; and I tell you one by one with an explanation and a declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 I say therefore, that when a wound is small and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it back; then that is for one of the two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said; or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 When it is like this, then it is necessary that you heat it, so that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or boil in water of squills, and cyperus, and spike, and wormwood with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes it makes wine in which there is bitterness; and that is better than water alone for the resolution of inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When you see that the inflation has already been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which wormwood or mallow was boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For this reason, it opens the opening of it when the injury is small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If, however, there is an exit again after this treatment; then sew up the rupture with a tool that is used to cut hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than cutting; and there is no need to force it to cut after necessity and lack of tools.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Make one part of it twisted, sharp, and another not sharp, and the end should not be delicate like spatula, but rather blunter; and that is similar to a thong, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that its reduction should be according to its own natural shape in its own proper place, if possible on top of it; because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When the wound is wide at the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary to make the patient lie on his back and put his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is at the upper part of the abdomen, then put the patient's head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly, if the wound is at one of the two parts of the abdomen, then direct your attention and consider that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 Therefore, you must insert it into large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 In small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then let a faithful servant be present among your hands who will hold the entire wound with his hand and bring the edges together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then cut something from that which follows for suture material; this is the common method of suturing one thing.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is to take a needle or a number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then take a finger's breadth from the end of the wound, that is to say, the doctor's; and insert one needle beyond which you will introduce thread into both sides of the skin, with both ends of the suture that is beneath the skin from inside, until it penetrates from the other side, and you have already brought together the two edges of the skin and the two ends of the suture; and there are four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then sew with double thread around the needle several times at both edges together until the two lips of the wound are joined with a proper stitching.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then release the thickness of the digit and also fix another point in them; afterwards draw it straight with thread, as you did with the first point.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Do not cease to do that with the points required from the needles, until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 Let the points be of medium thickness between coarseness and finesse; because very fine needles deeply pierce the flesh quickly, and coarse ones are difficult to enter the skin; therefore it is necessary that they should be of medium thickness both in finesse and coarseness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 It is not advisable for the needle to be bent at the ends close to the skin much; so that the flesh is not pierced quickly and the wound opened before its consolidation, and in order that they do not elongate even when sutured, preventing consolidation of the wound.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the tips of the needles so as not to injure a weak person in his sleep; and place small pieces of cloth from all sides on them, which will hold the ends of the needles; and release them until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And this kind of suturing with needles in such a way is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because it is sufficient for their suturing one or two needles, or about as many.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second suture is the common one, so that you gather with the suture the ends of four: the ends of two skins and the ends of two threads in place of one, with a needle in which there is a thread wound equally fine and coarse.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then, when you pierce with the needle these four ends, pull back the needle from the part from which you started so that the thread, retained at the top of the wound, falls out; so that the suture is like the suture of cloth where clothes are sewn together, and place between every stitch a quantity equal to the thickness of a small finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 This suture they know (humans).
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this suture, I myself sewed up the wound of a man in his belly, who had been wounded by a knife, and the wound was larger than one palm: and out came from the intestines about two palms of the middle intestine, and the rupture was in the midst of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I therefore brought it back after the intestine of his remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound was therefore consolidated in a space that was about fifteen days: and I healed it, and it became well: and he lived after that for many years, converted to his customs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the physicians had judged, that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And by a miracle, I did not heal (it) with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in a place where no ointment was found nor any medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 I therefore put warm cloth on the wound twice a day, and I was attending to its cleansing with water of honey until it became well.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 I will however say two types of suture according to the narrative of speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it is, that you begin with sharp suture: and thrust a needle from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle penetrates into the skin and goes through according to the length and width of the entire body: then release the end of the suture on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate into another end from the inside to outside in the other extreme.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you make it penetrate (again), then make it penetrate according to this in the same extreme from outside to inside: and release the end of the suture which is on that side, and make the needle penetrate into another end from the inside to outside: and make it penetrate with your thrust as you are making it penetrate in the other end of the suture, which is in that part, until it penetrates through all.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then also begin from the same side, and take it along with its extremity, which is from sifac in another side, and extract the point that has penetrated the skin.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Reduce it to the same skin, and take it along with its sifac extremity, which is on the other side, together with this extremity of mirach: extract it from the skin on that side, do the same for the other side: and do it alternately until you have completely extracted it according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 The sum of this suture is that the sutures of the skin are more superficial than those of the flesh: thus, one of the sifacs should be sewn with the extremity of the skin on one side, and release it with the other side until you have completed.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second species of suture mentioned by Galenus.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This speech is said to be like the method used by some physicians, so that they gather together all parts fitting by nature and bring them together: and apply the extremity of the sifac to another extremity, and the extremity of mirach to another extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And this is done as I have told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 It is necessary that you fix the point of the mirach on its extremity that is near to you on the outside, and make it penetrate to the interior in that alone, and release the two extremities of the sifacs.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the point, and make it penetrate from the outside to the interior in both extremities of the sifacs.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both and also make both penetrate from the inside to the outside, in the two extremities of the other mirachs that are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of suture is better than the common and easy one, and is the suture of which the preceding recollection was mentioned.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 This is therefore the discourse of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And certain ones said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The stitching of the abdomen is to be adjusted with two points.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 It is to insert one thread into each of them: and begin with the introduction of the needle, from what is with you, and make it pass through to the other side, according to the stitching of those who sew skin equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when a rupture is in the middle of the abdomen: then the stitching of it is more difficult than in any other place of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment of the medicine for a wound, is the judgment for other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 It is that when you catch a new wound with its own blood, before it changes by air: and reduce the intestine and suture it and prepare it: then place it on a bed of powdered meat.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If air has already changed the wound: then place on it some ointments that are present with you, so that they make pus: and let the threads fall out, and be tied together with sifak, and covered with mirach.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it as is the treatment for other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 If there are no medicines present with you, then place on it immediately, as soon as it begins to emit pus, old bread: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need other medicines when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 If you fear that the wound may communicate with principal limbs on injury, then it is necessary to immerse a soft wool in warm oil or rose oil: and place it around the area of the loins and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then cleanse him with a mixture of stiptic wine, black, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and an opening has been made penetrating to the depth of its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal, and that which is from the small intestine is harder to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine which is called Jejunum, does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from veins, and the size of them, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of the proximity of its nature to nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If what comes out from the wound is pus, and you grasp it fresh: return it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 But if space has passed and it has already become green or black: then you should stitch it with thread above the place that has become blackened, so that there is no bleeding.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in pus there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the thread hanging from below on the lower part of the wound outside it: so as to be relieved of its attraction towards you, and extraction of it in case of pus discharge, and emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Reminder for a wound that occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a break in the intestine and it is small: then it can be restored in some people: because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old: and it became a fistula, and it discharged excrement, and gas.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 I therefore carried out the treatment, until I was confident in its cure; and I did not cease to probe it (the wound), until it was healed and the location had become solid.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 When I saw the location solidified, I feared that something harmful might happen to it (the patient), lest something bad occur within him (the wound); and nothing of that sort happened to him from that (incident).
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, urinating, taking a bath, and engaging in his daily activities.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And some experimenters said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And (there are) those who take large-headed ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather together two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When it (the ant) bites on that (the wound), and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it will stick and will not be released.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing that, according to the size of the wound in total.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then reduce (the patient) and suture the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For those heads remain attached to the intestine until it is eaten, healed and no harm comes to the patient thoroughly.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And it is now possible to tie the intestine even with fine thread; which was removed from the intestine of the animal and attached to it when introduced into the point.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And (there is) that you take the end part of this thread from the intestine and scrape it much.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a fine linen thread at the end of it (the scraped intestine).
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert that thread into the point and also with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then reduce it to a rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this method of sewing with worms and the intestine, is not but according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a wound which is large and wide, especially if it is on one of the slender intestines, then there is no remedy but subtlety; nor is its healing altogether.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 Chapter on the Care of an Ulcer (Zuchemen) and Abscesses (Fistulae).
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that every wound or abscess which becomes old and turns into an ulcer and does not heal and discharges pus continuously and does not burst: then it is called universally in whatever member it may be a Fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And a Fistula is indeed according to truth a filtering knot, hard, white; with which there is no pain, but a hollow like the feather of a bird: and for this reason some call it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And there are certain hours that emit pus which is moist.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 Perhaps moisture is divided at certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 Sometimes this moisture is abundant and sometimes it is scant; it is coarse and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already mentioned the division when I said wounds; for any sore that does not heal is not born in it unless because of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 Of which one is, or because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because it is malicious; or because there is hard flesh between it and its surface, preventing the birth of flesh; or because there are many sores and pustules; or because the sore itself is putrid, and the matter that is emitted to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is inappropriate for its healing; or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of plague, or by nature, as happens in Caesaraugusta; in which the digestion of illnesses becomes difficult, and the healing of abscesses is delayed through nature; or because there is one bone, or the number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and the cures for them with medicines in the division; here it is necessary for me to make you know the cure for a fistula (fistula) and zukan (a type of abscess or ulcer), which is done by means of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Therefore you know that a fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For among them are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, nerves, or sifac; or the intestines, or bladder, or one of the ribs; or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints composed in a composition; such as the hands and feet; and among them are those that go to the proximity of the main member and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 Which of these fistulas is managed in this manner, is difficult to cure from diseases, and does not receive treatment; occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If any of these fistulas has a depth not reaching the places I mentioned and you hope for its cure, trust in it and wish to reach knowledge about it, then take the probe from air or iron if the fistula is straight; explore it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If there is a twisting in the fistula, then examine it with a probe made of soft lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Since lead, due to its softness, is bent around the twist.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the fistula has many openings, it will not be possible for you to sign over it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 So anoint the opening from its openings (with clisteria).
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For the moisture you apply as a clisterium flows through other openings and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then examine carefully according to the method that is possible for you, so that you may know whether it is bone or nerve and the fistula is a deep one, far or near; or if it is a single fistula with many openings, standing on top of everything, with all your strength, by questioning the sick person, and by feeling pain under compression with your hand at the place, and similar signs and causes of the affliction.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When you are stationed over all of it (the fistula), then go to its treatment according to your confidence; and consider whether it is a fistula near the surface, or in a distant place from the junction, from nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places mentioned to you; then cut the fistula as stated earlier in my narrative, remove what is in it from filtration, and what grows corrupt flesh, or pus, or similar things from its opening; take care of it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If a fistula is deep-seated and straight: then it is necessary to cut (or excise) it as deeply as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse it from all the corrupted flesh of it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then apply a linen cloth soaked in sharp medications and insert it up to the depth of the fistula that you have seized with an iron; do this several times, until the sharp medication corrodes all that remains in the hollow of the fistula due to corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with unguents that generate healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 But if it does not heal by this, then cauterize (it) as we have described before.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you are certain of this: then find it and cut it according to what I have told you; if it does not forbid you something from the vein, or nerve, or principal member as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If a bone is discovered and there is something corrupt and darkening (blackening) in it: then file (smooth) it until the entire corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with that which causes it to heal, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal and discharges pus as it did before: then know that you have not reached complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Discover (or examine) above it again, and excavate its cause, and cleanse it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it heals, that is good; if not, then know that the corruption is in a deep remote part of the body that you did not reach.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 You do not have skill in it, unless you abandon (it) to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If a small bone is corrupted and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps that fit it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If there are many bones, then carefully draw out all of them, do not leave anything behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If something hinders you from it due to some humidity and there is no fear or error in the incision of them: then cut those humidities and flesh, if there are any there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If you are not prepared to remove the bones from your time, then place something over the wound that rots it and let it go until it rots what is around the bone's circumference from flesh and humidity.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And keep the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And tighten the incision which you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Or place on it, if you fear, a linen cloth soaked in crushed sulfur mixed with oil, or a linen cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any green ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those (humidities) have rotted, and the bones are separated from them, the removal of them is alleviated, and the drawing out of the bones.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If there is a large bone such as the leg bone or hip bone, and what has become corrupt from it is a large part: then shave it with the final plane, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If what is in it has become corrupt and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it must be sawn and cut through entirely to the place where the corruption has come, then care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you zuken, which happens to a man in his leg: place it as an example and assistance for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 A man of about thirty years old had pain in his limb, which was caused from within his body until the matter reached his leg, and it was cut out with a large incision; and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 The time extended with the error of physicians until the abscess was opened, and many substances gathered with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 His treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulated, and many openings were made in it; all of which discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 A multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of hands until I was summoned, and I saw his leg, and the materials that were flowing from those openings in a large stream; even the entire body of the man had turned into ulcers, and his color was jaundiced.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and it reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings; and I found that they were connected to each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I advanced, and cut through one of the openings until I exposed a part of the bone; and I found it corrupted: which was already rotten, blackened, decayed, pierced, and had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 I then sawed what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I concluded that there was no part of the bone other than the corruption which I had removed and sawed off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And I had already excised it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I set the healing of the wound with consolidating medicines in a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it is not healed.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried and opened the second time above the first detection: and found continuous corruption with bone: and cut what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 I then attempted the restoration of it.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 I then opened it again, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and try its restoration: and it is not restored, until I had cut through the bone about one inch, and extracted that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 I then restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this iteration in the operation of it, and section of it, was not necessary except for the disposition of the patient's weakness, and his small tolerance, and my fear over him about death: since bad fainting frequently occurred to him at all hours due to an excess of evacuation.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 Therefore it is healed completely: and new flesh hard has grown in the place of the bone, and good was made the arrangement in his body, and his strength returned: and he turned to his dispositions: and no harm at all was done to him by walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 But if the prominent bone in the body is already broken: then it must be cut as follows: and this is: to take a ligament, and tighten it at the end of the prominent bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and place another thicker sinew ligament below the first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then bind it on the flesh that is under the bone: and extend its end so as to pull the flesh downwards: and you will open the flesh where you want to cut, so as not to wound the knife the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place wood or a board under the bone below: because when you do that, it is not forbidden to cut the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 It is necessary that the Trepan (Serratura) be above the damaged area slightly, so that the corruption of the bone does not occur in concavity: and it should not appear to the sense in its appearance, and it compels another (for its function).
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is corrupted and it is not projecting but rather continuous with another part, and the corruption is in its middle or a part of itself: then cut off all the flesh from every side.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place the lever below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Then cut with the saw from one side where there is corruption, until the lever comes to meet it from another side: and let the lever be slightly beyond the corruption, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the corruption is at a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and saw the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 But if the corruption is at a connection of two joints, then there is no remedy for it except to abrade (it).
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the corruption is at the beak of a hand or foot: then the matter is very difficult in that case.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary to investigate the nature of the corruption as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And abrade it and clean it as well as you can according to whatever position it presents to you and with whatever tool is available to you: when it does not cause you harm by the vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that the instruments for cutting and sawing these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety, their size, their smallness, their hardness, and their scarcity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to prepare every kind of instrument suitable for the operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations signify to you the type of instrument you need, when your study requires it for a long time.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	and the knowledge of the modes of this art, is evidence of the modes of diseases: for then indeed you will find what suits it from yourself, concerning all afflictions with instruments.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you shall place examples on what you cut, and proof on others.
Forma Serrae.	 Form of the Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of another Saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This form of the Saw should be well made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Let the upper part of its arc be made, and its edge from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and let it be pyramidal.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 Form of the Razor for Joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 The head of this rasp should be shaped like the head of a star-shaped nail: and its points should be shaped according to the form of pointed file nails.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 It does not suit it unless that it rubs against the heads of joints when they are broken, or a large and thick bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 Form of a larger Razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 Form of the middle Razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 Form of the wide Razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 Form of a rasp with a hollow.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 Form of another fine Razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 Form of another Razor with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 Form of the small fine rasp.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 Form of the rasp for cutting bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also, form of a large rasp.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 It resembles a saw and its end is like a rasp: it is used in many places for the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 The form of a rasp that suits for cutting it which has been pierced by bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its end is triangular and sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	 It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly, it is necessary that everything we have said be made from files, cutters, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 Section on the incision of extremities, and the setting of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Head LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 Rotten ends, either from external cause, or internal.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 When you have been treated for that corruption with medicines and the treatment does not work and you see that the corruption is spreading into a limb which has no reaction: then it is necessary to amputate that limb until the spread of corruption stops, so that the weak part can go out through it either from death or from the greater malignancy which is due to the loss of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 The mark that happens to it is what decays the limb, until it seems burned by fire, or rots after blackness: until that rot reaches the following limb and creeps through the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Approach therefore with the incision of that, and likewise if the cause of corruption is from the strike of certain venomous creatures such as marine scorpions, weasels, nettles, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If therefore the corruption, or strike is at the end of a finger, then incise the finger, and do not leave any space for the rot, so that it may reach the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it happens in the hand, then incise it from the root of the palm and do not leave any space for the rot, until it reaches the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it invades that, then incise the arm near the elbow at its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If however the rot passes through and you see him about an elbow, then it is the death of a weak man.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And beyond that in cure, is the amount of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly do with the foot when rot invades a finger, then cut it at one knuckle: and if it reaches the bone of the toe, then cut the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 If however it rises to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 If however rot has reached above the knee, then there is no remedy for it, but to release and abandon the weak to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the manner of cutting a limb, or of binding it is, to tighten the ligament at the lower part that you wish to cut and to tighten another ligament above that place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And extend one of the ligaments downwards, and extend another ligament upwards towards the top.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 Separate the flesh that is between two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then, it should be cut or tied.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary that you place a linen cloth on all parts, and not touch the healthy place with the knife; and an injury added to the weak should happen, and the abscess warm.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 If there is an internal bleeding during the operation, then quickly cauterize the place; or put some powder that absorbs blood on top of it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your medication until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament, and take care of it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same thing happens as I told you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 This is because there is blackening in his foot, with a burn resembling fire burning; and the corruption first happens in his toe, until it began to affect his entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore, the man moved himself away from it, after he saw corruption happening in his limb with great pain, which he found out through pain and burning; and he cut it off at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long period of time, the same corruption happened to him in his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that loss by placing some medicine on his hand after cleaning his body; but the loss was not recovered, and it began to affect another finger; until corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 He then called me to cut off his hand; but I did not want that, hoping for the recovery of the loss from me; and I also feared death for him at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 The virtue of a man was above his misfortune.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 After he had given up hope in me, he returned to his own land; and reached me concerning that matter, because he hastened, and fell on his whole hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 I bring this narrative only as help for that which falls under the genus of this disease; and it is a signification to be understood, and according to which it should be done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 Chapter on the cure of sinuses, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	 Chapter XC (Roman numerals).
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members and the space of the abscess extends until it collects pus; then it breaks or perforates, and what is in it exits through the pus, and leaves a vacant place as if it were a vessel; and the skin that is on top of it has become thin like a piece of cloth which has been woven fine; and it does not progress to complete corruption nor press into bone, nerve or ligament: it should be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula; however, if its space extends until corruption presses into one of these members, then it is called a Fistula or ulcer.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And its treatment is to incise the entire skin as it rolls; and especially when it has become thin, and made like a piece of cloth; and trust that it will not adhere because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If you hope that the skin will adhere, and this final corruption does not follow as a result; and if there is thickness in the skin from the flesh, then treat it with clisterium: and consider for a sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 If it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor; then clisterize it with medicine from Egypt, which is vinegar, oil, and zinziber; parts receiving equal amounts should be combined in a vessel: and boil it over fire, until the medicine turns red: and let it become thick like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take that which is necessary for you: and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema it with the mixture; and sew up its opening, and leave the medicine within for two hours quantity.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then extract it with expression: do so for days until the sinus is purified and the stench removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And when an enema with ashes of water is to be administered, if this medicine is not present at hand: and it is that you receive the ashes from vinewood or from hollywood; and cast upon her the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then cook it and give an enema with it until you are confident that the sinus is purified.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If the patient is not able to bear the Egyptian medicine or water and ashes, then give an enema with water and honey, which has already been mixed with something from crushed onions.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or give an enema with honey and wine mixed, for the property of honey is to purify and cleanse; and wine makes the sinus adhere, particularly when there is excess dryness and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you have done that several times and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has been removed: then give an enema with it which produces flesh within it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And it is that you receive dyafinicon from the plaster; and dissolve it with rose oil and stiptic wine; or give an enema with certain medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the opening of the sinus is narrow and it does not accept an enema cannula: then expand it slightly with iron; or place linen wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment within it until it expands.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And likewise, if there is also a large opening, then gather its lips with suture; and leave within it an amount for the enema to enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if there is an opening from which pus flows, it should be elevated towards the higher parts; then cut it at a lower location within itself, so that the pus can run out towards the lower parts; because when the pus is obstructed in depth, it prevents flesh from forming in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus approximately below it as you wish; then try to prepare the member with a preparation by which the pus can flow out easily according to what you are preparing yourself.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try not to retain anything from the pus at all; and receive consolidating medications that are placed on the sign, appropriate for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 And spread them on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the cloth be of such size that it allows communication of the entire Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then cut with scissors directly into the opening of the Sinus a hole larger than the opening of the Sinus itself.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread a layer of soft ointments on another cloth according to the size of the hole; and place it above it at a distance from the opening of the Sinus so as to facilitate the exit of the pus; do not remove the large cloth unless after several days, once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 The one who is above the opening of the Sinus, that is the one you should remove at any hour to let out what has accumulated in it from the pus; and so that you know whether what runs out from it is much or little, digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And again consider the location of the Sinus itself, whether it feels pain to its master or not, and whether there is a boil in it or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 When therefore your treatment is thus extended and you see the matter which comes out of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus already adheres or approaches to adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If for a long time a subtle virus comes out of the Sinus, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since there are some people who heal slowly in their wounds, and there are others who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 If for many days an undigested pus comes out of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If therefore the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed and its treatment prolonged: then add drying medicines in the process, but let the physicians do so that the medicines be in their substance humid and in their virtue dry, such as dyafinicon ointment when excess is added to it from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the last remedy to be used, it is that you take dyafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and stir it over it old wine equal in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then make a mixture of these ingredients and use the remedy.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And make a similar remedy to this, when you do not have dyafinicon ointment at hand, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use the resulting mixture.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or take myrrh, aloes, and frankincense; grind all of them together and powder it over honey while it is above the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then cover it with a cloth and press it on the Sinus: and cover it with honey that you have boiled until thickened, powder over it and place it on the cloth, and press it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And at times aristacularia longa (long caltrop), roots of the celestial lily, and the lily are administered; and wheat flour, and chicory.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use these simple remedies, or compound them, grind them and sift the powders; and powder over honey as I have said, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the ailment in the sinuses persists and is not cured by this treatment, you should know that there is corruption deep within it; or it has already made an impression on the bones, or other hard parts of the body, or ligaments; then treat it with fistula treatment, as previously mentioned.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 Chapter on the treatment of warts and the worn nails, and incisions and amputations.
Caput XCI.	 Chapter CXCI (111).
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Warts are boils that appear under the nail of the thumb or big toe; perhaps they may also grow on other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 When the wart persists and is neglected and treated with boiling water, it may rot away and emit pus until it erodes the root of the nail; perhaps it rots completely and the corruption reaches the bone, so that there is a foul smell and the tip of the finger becomes wide and turns black.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you treat the wart as I have said, and your treatment does not help; then it is necessary to cut off the entire overgrowth that remains from the nail with a knife.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 Indeed, cautery is very beneficial.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If the bone is healthy and the nail is also sound, and there are no additional overgrowths on the nail; but the flesh has become compressed beneath the nail and begins to hurt and wound it; then place a fine radium under the angle of the nail which wounds the flesh, and push it upwards; and cut the flesh easily with a knife, and apply medicines for burning, corrosive substances on what remains of the flesh until it is completely removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If pus already presses into the bone, then it is necessary to make an incision in that bone and extract it; for a bone does not heal while there remains pus-filled bone.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see pus and decay advancing towards the finger, then cut it off at a joint, according to the previously mentioned reminder of this procedure.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If there is a nail injury or blow and a violent pain occurs, then it is necessary to use leeches first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut the nail off with a sharp Spatumil, from below towards the surface.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And ensure that the incision does not reach the skin beneath the nail, for you will cause a violent pain to arise above it, and this will be the cause of the growth of new flesh at that location.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then treat the place with something that alleviates the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 The finger that is born in some human hands may be entirely fleshy; and it may have bones in some of them, and a nail in others; and it may be born at the root of the joint or its growth may occur in some of the joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 Therefore, a finger that is born at some joints does not move; and one that is born at the joint of the finger may possibly move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 The one who has flesh, therefore, can be easily cut.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 Therefore, make an incision at the root with a broad Spatumil.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 The treatment of one whose growth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, refrain from making an incision on it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 In the finger that is born at the end joint, then it is necessary to make a round incision in the flesh until the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then cut the bone with a saw that fits among those fitting to it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 Consolidation, however, which often occurs in fingers, happens either by birth, that is, it is born with it, or from consolidation of a wound, or from burns, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, one should remove that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place between them linen or gauze soaked in rose oil to prevent consolidation or separation of the fingers; or place between them a thin lead plate until the area heals as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if there is consolidation on some fingers with the palm, then remove that consolidation as appropriate and in accordance with the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 [Section title: On the vice of incision.]
Caput XCII.	 Chapter XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Ulcers are veins twisted, thick, filled with melancholic excesses that occur in many parts of the body; and their most frequent outlet is in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and laborers, and those carrying heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore, it is necessary to administer the expulsion of the body from black cholera at times by means of a strong purge.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then let the patient's vein be opened in the basilic (vein).
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 The treatment of these is with iron, according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One method is, to cauterize and draw out black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And the other method is, that the vein is raised and all (the blood) is drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The section of this (vein) is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 Anoint the leg with warm embrocation and much water until the thick, filthy blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then bind the sick person's leg from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the thigh with bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein at one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then raise (the vein), i.e., draw out the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and it is necessary that a leech be applied to the sick person first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut the fingernail down as far as necessary: until a sufficient amount of blood is expelled, and as much as the strength of the sick person can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Then tie it up: and order him to abstain from foods that cause black cholera; and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and this is harmful for the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 Raising (the vein) is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Shave the leg of the sick person if there are many hairs.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then insert it into the bath or apply embrocation on his leg with warm water until it turns red and veins swell; or exercise it by strong movement if there is no bath available, until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then dry the skin along the vein's incision lengthwise; or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then peel off the skin with combs and scrape the vein from every side until it becomes visible to touch; and at its appearance, you will see it turn from red to blackish purple.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When the vessel has been reached through the skin, you see it as white like a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert the Ray under it until it raises and comes out of the skin; hang it with a blunt comb.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then make another incision near that one with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then peel off the skin from above the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then lift it with Rays as you did before, and hang it with another comb as you did at the beginning.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then make another incision or multiple incisions if necessary for that one.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then peel off and cut the last incision at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then draw it out to the incision above that one.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you draw it out from the incision above that one or all the higher incisions, until it comes out completely; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If it does not obey you to be drawn out and lifted; then insert a sharp awl with a strong thread and tie it and draw it out itself; or insert the Ray under it and turn your hand over every part until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful not to cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it out and an injury may enter the patient from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you have extracted [it] completely, then place wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or olive oil, on the wound site, and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If it is a wound from a vine with twisting and spiraling, not straight as we have said, then you should open it completely along all its twists and the places of the spiral.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then hang it with hooks until you have extracted it entirely; beware not to cut the vein or wound while making the incision, for it will be difficult for you to extract or remove it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Therefore, exercise caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The shape of the incision for healing a wound from a vine.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The shape of the blind hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 Its not like the other hooks with sharp tips that might cut a vein; rather it is thick and curved but not too pointed. If it were delicate, it would pierce the vein through its delicacy; on the contrary, it should have unnecessary thickness as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the extraction of the leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, as Alizegi and the Arabs say, and in dry, hot lands with little softness, that is, where no plant or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 Its generation is indeed from putrefaction that occurs beneath the skin, as it does within the bodies of snakes and worms called ascaris, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of its incision is that it occurs when there is a very hot inflammation in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then let the location be bled.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal, the vein begins to come out from that bled location.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When its end appears, then it is necessary that you wind a piece of lead around it, whose weight should be one keil of a drachma, up to two drachms and knots; and let go the suspended lead from the arm.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something comes out of it towards the outside, wind it with lead and knot it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it extends a lot, then cut off its part, and wind the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut off its root before it has come out completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 Because if you cut it, it contracts and goes into the flesh; it causes an abscess to occur, and pus in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore it is necessary that it be treated gently and drawn out gradually until it comes out from the end of it, and nothing remains in the body from it; and from this vein, in some people, something comes out that is five fingers long and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has reached me, for a man of twenty palms has come out from it.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If it is cut during your treatment: then insert a probe into its opening and pierce it with a long hole, together with the body, until all that is in it from the matter is evacuated; and apply a poultice to the place with medicines for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then treat it with treatment for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 This vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or on the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore treat it as we said earlier, and with what was mentioned before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 On the section made over worms generated beneath the skin, and it is called Bouina's illness.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter CXIIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This illness is named among us Bouina's disease because it frequently happens to cows and there is a small worm born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it moves throughout the body, ascending and descending; and it is detected by the sense when walking from limb to limb until it bursts at any point where it bursts on the skin surface and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation is from the corruption of certain fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 As worms and snakes, that is to say, leeches and roundworms occur in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it is feared due to its malignancy.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it moves within the body and rises to the head and reaches the location; then possibly it opens there and comes out and destroys an eye; and this happens frequently.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 When it is desired to cure him and extract the worm itself; then this cannot be done except during its walking and the appearance of the worm to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you compress what is above it and what is below it with a strong binding.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut through it and extract him.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it is probed into the flesh and the worm cannot be found; then place a cautery over the location with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And the greater one that is feared, is its corruption which destroys the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If you see it has already reached the head near the eye; then compress above it with a good tightening band.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut through it and extract him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 And the sick person should use self-cleaning of his body, with remedies that dissolve corrupt fluids.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let them avoid foods causing putrefaction to themselves.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 On incision for the illness of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter CXV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This illness is called Nakir on our land: it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then changes from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I myself have already seen it, as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 She rolled up her arm, and I saw a swelling smaller than the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after staying for one hour, I saw a swelling crawl with a worm-like motion, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than possible: it was like liquid silver flowing from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 The pain therefore has receded from that place, and it was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then it stayed for one hour, and ran through the rest of the body, until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then he told me that he was turning all over his body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 I was therefore amazed at the speed of his change from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed, before that, I had not seen this sickness with my eyes in such a manner as it was now.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 Nevertheless, I saw many who found pain change from one limb to another; and I did not see it as I saw it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that it was anything other than because the woman was from those who are driers of bodies, detached veins; whence it appears that the windiness (ventosity) was changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and moist bodies, hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 Therefore, when you desire to cure it and the patient feels that pain; then if it appears to you as we have said, then press on top of it quickly and below it; and cut above it until the windiness compressed is expelled; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 But if you do not see it with your eyes: then cure it with the expulsion of the body, and with that which expels the windiness, and crushes them with stinking pills, and pills of mastic, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 Chapter on Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows are diversified according to their kind, and according to the places in which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 The diversity of them is because there are some that have large points and small; concave and blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And among them are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And among them are those which have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And among them are those which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 Those indeed which are among the limbs, fall according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 For indeed the limbs are hollow from principal members, such as the brain, and heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar things.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When therefore it falls among any of these limbs and the signs of death appear to you, which I will tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you turn to the extraction of this arrow, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when these signs are not evident to you and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then draw it out yourself and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 Among the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and pierces the bone and comes out from above the brain is: because strong seizures, fainting, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera can occur.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And from the wound place whiteness similar to plaster comes out.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And it comes out like a boil-like tissue from there.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and pull out the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of an arrow when it falls in the heart are: that it is close to the left breast and feels as if it is fixed in a hard place, not in a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps there is an arrow movement similar to heartbeat: and blood runs out from the wound black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And it follows that coldness of limbs, cold sweat, and fainting occurs.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Therefore, you should know for sure that death is approaching.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 The sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is that sputum comes out from the wound, and the containers following the neck should be removed, and the person's complexion becomes weak.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And it breathes out a large, deep breath and seeks cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the chest, which is in the lung: then it is close to small ribs: and a great panting occurs with very strong pain, with sighing, and all the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 And if the arrow falls into the abdomen and sticks there, something like feces comes out from the wound, or pus, or a broken intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore, there is no hope for treatment of this person or for extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out: and something proceeds to the outside, and the pain is greater than the illness: then you know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The remaining limbs, like the face, neck, throat, spatula, assistant, dorsal spine, crossbar, thigh, and similar members are saved according to several arrangements when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not venomous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you what I saw about these arrows to indicate by that for your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 That is, because a man fell with an arrow into his tear duct of the eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 So I extracted it from the other side, under his ear fat: and he was cured, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which had fallen upon him under his lower eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not find any part of it except a small portion that adhered to the wood: and the arrow was a large one from Turkish arrows with a soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 Therefore, the Jew was cured, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 The arrow was Arabic, and it had ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 I cut it then across the two wings: and it was already sunken into his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 I sharpened myself with it until I extracted it: and the Christian was cured.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I extracted another arrow from a man who fell upon it on his abdomen: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days had passed over him and nothing changed in his condition, I cut across the arrow: and I sharpened myself upon it, and extracted it: and he was cured, and no harm came to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man whose arrow fell upon his back, and the wound was healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 And I saw a woman whose arrow fell into her womb, and the wound was healed over it; and the arrow remained within her, and no change occurred in her disposition or any harm to the woman from her own natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 And I saw another man whose arrow fell upon his face; and the wound healed over it, and remained, causing him little pain; and many such things happened.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes who had it fall upon his nose in the middle, and already it had turned slightly to the right; and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 I was therefore called for his treatment until three days after the loss of the arrow.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 I found then a tightly closed wound of the arrow.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 Therefore I asked it with fine probing, and it did not feel it; but he himself found pain and a puncture on his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 Therefore I hoped that this was the wound from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I applied then the place with a plaster containing attracting and digestive properties, confident that the wound would open up and reveal the sign of the arrow so that I might cut it; but this did not happen at the place where something happened, indicating that the arrow had missed the spot.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I remained then with the plaster on him for many days; but nothing happened at the place; and the wound healed over in the meantime, and he remained weak from extraction of it until one day he felt the arrow in his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 I therefore laid an acidic medicine on the wound for many days until it was open; and when I tested it, I felt a subtle arrowhead tip which stuck to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added into the wound opening that sharp medicine until we could see clearly the arrow tip; and it passed by me with a space of about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then, when the wound was swollen, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not obey to come out; then I did not stop trying, and devising means over it with various methods, until I began on a certain day with well-made forceps, according to the shape that comes in the end of the chapter, until I pulled it out.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I healed the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 I therefore healed it, and the wound became firm and was healed with complete health; it did not harm him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of the extraction of some arrows; put this rule and meaning on what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Because the parts and distinctions of this art are not comprehended with a narration; nor does the book include it, and the skillful craftsman compares little to much; and with what is present, to what is absent; and he discovers a new operation, and a new instrument for descents of foreign things in this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 I therefore say that arrows do not come out from the members on which they are fixed, unless in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or by attraction from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Opposite part of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which goes out where it entered, is either an arrow passing through flesh and is drawn out, or it is a foreign body inserted into a cavity, such as a splinter or stone, that cannot be extracted.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not come out within the hour that it fell: then it is necessary to let it be for some days until the flesh surrounding it rots; and its attraction will decrease, and it will come out.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly, if it impales a bone and does not come out for you, then let it be also for some days; and press and move it every day until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 If it does not come out from you after days, then it is necessary to bore around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine drill, until the arrow enlarges.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then draw it out and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the arrow is fixed in the skull bone and has already penetrated one of the ventricles of the brain and some symptoms are observed that I have mentioned: then refrain from pulling the arrow and let it be until its course becomes even after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if the arrow has reached the heart, death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of a bone only, and does not penetrate to the heart; and it remains sick for some days, and nothing of those symptoms occurs to him: then apply your skill in drawing out the arrow.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 If it is firmly fixed and does not obey you to be drawn out: then administer a drill around the arrow as I have told you; then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the arrow is already concealed in a part of the body, and hidden and concealed from sensation: then search for it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If you feel it (the wound), then draw it out with certain instruments that are suitable for drawing it out.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot pull it out because of the constriction of the wound and because the arrow is deep, and there is no bone, nerve or vein there: then pierce it and let the wound swell up until it can be pulled out the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If there are ears attached to it (the arrow), then free the fixed flesh from them on all sides as much as you can, with every skill you have, and the skills, if it cannot be pulled out by force of the flesh in breaking or twisting the ears, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And when you draw out the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand with forceps in all directions until it comes out: and carefully and skillfully, so that the arrow does not break, and its drawing and extraction become difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot pull it out within an hour, then leave it for a few days until what is around it begins to rot.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then return to it: for the wound will heal itself. But if blood flow opposes you, then administer what I said in the chapter on cure: and keep your skill away from cutting a vein, nerve or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And apply all your skills in every way possible to draw out the arrow: and let it be done with ease, calmness, slowness or firmness, as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 It is necessary that when pulling out the arrow, it becomes weak in the shape it was at the time of the arrow wound.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Because it is more helpful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to the shapes (of the arrow).
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 Arrow that emerges from the opposite part of another, already proceeds to something exterior: or makes a hump at the tip of the arrow by sensation from the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it protruding: therefore cut above it, and let the section be according to the quantity so that forceps can grasp it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then draw it out; for indeed, it becomes easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 If it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow presses into the bone and swells itself: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: leave it for several days; then repeat drawing it out until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If there is wood in the arrow, then push it along with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 If the wood has fallen out, and you wish to apply pressure: then insert a concave instrument into it so that it enters the concavity of the arrow's tip; then push it along with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If the arrow is concave, then push it along with the inserted instrument.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 The arrow is held by that (thing).
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut away all the concave flesh where the poison is; if you can do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then care for it with whatever suits it (the remedy).
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow falls into the chest, or stomach, or bladder, or side: and is near that which you touch with your fingers, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut above it, and take care not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then heal the wound, if you see one, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 Extremities are similar to the beak of a bird, which have been made like iron: when they seize upon an arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 They become numerous, large, small and medium, according to the size of the arrow, its smallness, and the width and narrowness of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The shape of the projectile is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 The shape of the projectile is dull.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is a dull extremity like a radius so that it may be guided into the concave arrow and propelled with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The concavity of the projectile-extremity is concave like a bird's feather: so that it may be guided into the arrow and propelled by it.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 Chapter on Phlebotomy of Veins.

Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of bloodletting is as I have mentioned.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 It should be shaved that the head of the sick person; and it should be rubbed on the place of two veins with a rough cloth rubbing well.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the sick person should bind his neck with a bandage until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 The places [of these] are behind the ears in two depressed locations on the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Therefore, seek them with your finger and when you feel their pulse under your finger, mark that spot with hot wax.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take a lancet-shaped phlebotomy instrument, and it is called "Incisor".
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 Then insert it [the incisor] beneath the vein into the skin until the phlebotomy instrument reaches the bone.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 Then lift up your hand with the vein and skin to the top, and cut the vein along with the skin incision.

¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 Chapter on phlebotomy of two arteries in time (of illness).
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 The phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in two times [of illness], is useful for ancient migraine: and for sodom, prauvam, obtalmia assidua, and for the course of superfluidities effused acutely to the eyes.

Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 Let the sick person tighten his neck much, until two veins appear to the senses by a clear manifestation: and their pulse should be demonstrated under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then mark them with hot wax.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 Then lift up the skin over the vein to the top with your finger as an index and insert the phlebotomy instrument from below, and lift the vein to the top.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And cut it [the vein] as you did with the two other veins: and allow as much blood to come out according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 Then loosen the constriction of the patient, and place your finger on the hour vein.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then put on top of it [the wound] and the fingers, and bind it tightly from above with a strong constriction; and release it until it heals.

¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 Chapter on the vein of the forehead after the vein of the head.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.

Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the quality of its [the vein's] bloodletting is as I told you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 The patient constricts his neck with a ligature until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take the tool called Fossorium [Lancet].
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form [Description of lancet's shape].
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place the sharp point that is on the head of the Fossorium [lancet] on the vein, and strike it with a mallet or another tool in the same manner; and let the blood flow according to the amount you wish.

Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes it is opened with a wide bloodletting tool [Leech].
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it is not necessary that the bloodletter be of sharp tip, as the other bloodletters, but rather wide-tipped.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And the bloodletting is to be performed across [the vein] because the bone is close by; and perhaps the bloodletter will break it when it is sharp.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 Chapter on Bloodletting of the Veins in the Two Tear Ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 But the remedy for the two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes is for the eye with scabs and redness; and swelling in the eye, and diseases of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 And the quality of venesection [phlebotomy] is that it tightens the sick man's neck with a ligature.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then, for the venesection [phlebotomy], you shall be standing above his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 And the venesection [phlebotomy] shall be made transversely, slightly longer than usual, with a small incision, narrowly, because there is no flesh at that place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 If the venesectioner [phlebotomist] is subtle in his point, perhaps he may break it.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then, let blood run as much as you need.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 Put a bowl over them [the incisions], and tighten them at night, and untie them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 Chapter on the venesection of Nasal Veins.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 The venesection of the nasal veins is for acute fever, severe headache, facial ailments such as hemigraine and redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is chronic.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 The quality of phlebotomy in this case is to tighten the diseased neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a sharp and long phlebotomy needle; and fix it in the middle of the leper's nose, between that which distinguishes the nose according to its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Since the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And it is necessary that you should hold your hand with the phlebotomy needle a little; and let blood flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then tie [the leper's nose] up at night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it heals quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 Chapter on the phlebotomy of veins (Guidegu).
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 Guidegu's phlebotomy has two advantages: it helps in constriction of cough and onset of leprosy, melancholic diseases, impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that consume, i.e., herpes or eomenias.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 The quality of the phlebotomy for them is to tighten the diseased one under each neck with a bandage; and let the craftsman stand above the sick person's head, and the sick person be seated on a seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then the phlebotomy needle is slightly longer than usual for the vein phlebotomy.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then draw out a measured amount of blood or as much as you see is necessary for that purpose.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do the same with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Then loosen the bandage, and tighten two veins with a constriction in the middle; so that the sick person does not faint.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And let [the sick person] go until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 A wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 Chapter on the phlebotomy of veins (Algeberich).
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 Algeberich's vein phlebotomy has the advantage that it contributes to the alcohol in the mouth, and corruption of the gums; bad ulcers; cracks in the lips, and bad ulcers, even those that are in the nose, and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality of phlebotomy is that you should make the sick person sit before you; and tighten his neck with a bandage.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then roll back his lip, and look at the two veins; one is on the right side of his lip, and the second on his left; and the demonstration of each is through their blackening (or darkening).
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And that is true: because around them there are small veins, black ones.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Cut (or make an incision) therefore in both places with a cutting instrument.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If there is doubt over you and you do not know which one it is (the vein): then pay attention to the larger incision and make a more obvious one.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And similarly, do the same with the two veins that are on the upper lip; and most commonly it is done in this way; and cut the two veins which are on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 [Heading or Title:] Phlebotomy of the Vein under the Tongue after the Phlebotomy of the Head.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 But the advantage of phlebotomy for the veins under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the head (or cephalic phlebotomy) is for affections in the throat and diseases of the neck and mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person should sit between your hands before the sun; and open his mouth, and look under the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for a vein; and the color of each declines to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Cut (or make an incision) therefore both (veins); and be careful not to damage your hand while phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For there are arteries under it (the tongue), and perhaps blood will flow from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 [Heading or Title:] Three Veins on the Arm.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins that are to be cut for bleeding are found in which, and the practice of bleeding from these veins is common in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And the cutting of them (the three veins) is performed in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Or by piercing it with a wide-mouthed lancet (myrtinus): or by oiling to soften the edge of a decline: or by cutting with a small knife (cultellus), and this is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus, Alnesil is what is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from these (the three veins) there are wide and narrow forms according to the width of the veins and their constriction. The form of the lancet (myrtinus) should be wide, as you can see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it is suitable for opening hollow veins, full, extending, appearing, thick ones and those that contain coarse, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this lancet (phlebotomus) is of lesser width and sharper at the tip.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And it is suitable for the bleeding of fine veins that contain thin yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 [Section title] On Bascilica Bleeding.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 The Bascilica (one of the three veins) is beneficial for bleeding.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it draws blood from illnesses that are located under the throat and neck, since it follows the chest and abdomen, and it is suitable for the lancet (phlebotomator) to be cautious when bleeding this one, because beneath it there is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If therefore the lancet (phlebotomus) makes a mistake and adds in the puncture, it will cut the artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, the lancet (phlebotomus) must not puncture it: instead, it should be cutting with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the Basilica does not appear by clear manifestation, then it is necessary to remove it and move to another or seek one of its branches; or to use a ligature on the arm in its place.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 For indeed it is clear and when you cut it with a lancet as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If you wish to perform a phlebotomy on it, then it is necessary before the ligature of the arm, that you touch the place until you know the pulsating spot.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the spot with hot iron, afterwards cut the vein with a concave lancet as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And beware that the blow does not fall into the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see that, while you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with hot iron, then that swelling is the swelling of an artery; therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood rise at the phlebotomy, like the urine of a boy, and it is subtle, red; then know that it is from an artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Then hurry, and place your finger on it in a long space, afterwards remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then tighten the arm and release it; and let the weak avoid moving it; and beware of fearing it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move it for several days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 If the blood does not flow off and binds you; and if medicine is not present to you at the moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its ends contract and the blood flows off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig tree, and grind it; take one half portion, and tie it over the place of the vein's constriction with a ligament and piles until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	If it is cut off (the blood), it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 If not: then the care of him with that to whom it preceded is remembered at a place removing blood flow: and removal of blood from him is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the smallness of the wound location, and the possibility of binding from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 Chapter on Phlebotomy of the Vein Fusca.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The assistance of the vein Fusca for phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica, and a branch of the Cephalica, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it agrees with the phlebotomist that she (the vein) is above the fear of phlebotomy, for under her is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 If therefore it adds (in the phlebotomy) in a puncture and finds a nerve, stupor occurs in it, and the healing of it becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 If it is concealed in certain men and is subtle, and does not show itself: then one must place the phlebotomy of you with which you will phlebotomize it, section with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If the vein is between two nerves, then pierce the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 Chapter on the Vein Cephalica.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The assistance of phlebotomy of the Vein Cephalica is that it draws blood from the head and contributes to eye troubles.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And in this vein it is necessary to use olive oil or myrtle oil if you wish (to phlebotomize), because it is safer than all the veins since it is neither an artery nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 It is fitting for you during venesection (phlebotomy), that you ask the barber only to cut the arm, and seek a more lenient spot: it does not harm him if no such place is found on first striking, but he should return to the same spot with venesection several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 Perhaps a boil occurs in some people when not venesection is performed on first striking, but it does not harm him the boil in any case.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 Chapter on the utility of venesection (phlebotomy) and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The qualities and accidents of venesection (phlebotomy), and the correction of which you should consider.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 Firstly, you should know that venesection (phlebotomy) is not administered except in the conservation of health and its persistence, and with caution against the approach of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And that venesection (phlebotomy) should be performed on one of the three veins that are at the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Radial and the Median Cubital vein.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And that venesection (phlebotomy) should be performed at the beginning of spring after fasting, in summer and autumn and winter after food intake, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 And that venesection (phlebotomy) should be performed on the first or third day after passing three hours since the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 However, venesection (phlebotomy) administered for illnesses does not have a fixed hour: but when it is appropriate and necessary for that purpose, it may be done at night or day, and in every hour, and in every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 And it is not fitting to venesection children until they have reached fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 And women in childbirth should not be venesected from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Seniors are not to be bled who have passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 If anyone wishes to be bled for any reason: it is necessary that they clean their intestines before the bleeding with a soft enema, if there is much retained feces in them; so that no putrid waste from the intestines may attract during the bleeding harmful substances to the main limbs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 The patient suffering from gluttony (toctina), that is, satiety and nausea, should not be bled; nor the drunkard, nor the one who has just come out of drunkenness, until that state has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 The sick person with dropsy should not be bled.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 Care should be taken not to bleed again after a colon accident, or vomiting, or diarrhea, or increase in sexual activity, or labor, or exercise, or sleeplessness, or fasting, and all that dissolves the power of the body or an animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then, consider with subtlety the humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medications; if it can be done for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then enter a bath, if there is nothing to prevent it; or exercise in some way, so that the blood may be made more subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place the bleeding of him in the chest on the third day, as we have said; and try to have his chest evacuated by all bad animal accidents that day: such as anxiety, anger, fear; and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, punishment, excess, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And he shall have present the things with which customary use of man is accustomed from aromatics, fragrances, perfumes and similar things in quantity according to possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the phlebotomist sit on a stool higher than the phlebotomy stool; afterwards he shall draw out his arm and rub it with his hand twice or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then tie the ligature with a linen strip and wrap it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the ligature be moderated, because an uneven ligature, either by excessive tightening or by loosening, then it prevents the flow of blood; or in softening, then even it prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after ligating, it is necessary that the person being bled rubs his hands together simultaneously until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then the phlebotomist cleans the place of bleeding with a little oil, traditionally.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then he places his index finger of the left hand on that vein at the place where he wishes to make a cut, slightly; so that the vein is not driven away and the blow is cushioned.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Because the veins are as thin and elusive as strings at the place of bleeding; and from them is that which is full of wind, and when you put the lancet on it, it contracts under the lancet, and it deceives the lancet-wielder, and he does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is constricted; for this reason therefore, the lancet-wielder should be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then lay aside the lancet.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If, then, one vein is opened, that is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then do it again with the other vein at that place slightly or above it quickly; if not there.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 And if he faints or is weak, then dismiss him for a day or two; and do not tie the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Perhaps a hot abscess attracts (it).
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Do not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the wound is small and the blood flows thinly, fear that the required amount of blood will not come out: then perform another phlebotomy in the same vein according to correct procedure, and add a little more in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And perform it quickly before the abscess is removed, for in many people an abscess site is dangerous during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If therefore you see the abscess itself, then do not repeat (the procedure) over it at all, for it does not excuse anything on your part.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 Place something made of oil on top of it, because it promotes the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 It is better in this place than olive oil itself and other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And similarly administer oil ointment in every phlebotomy of yours where you phlebotomize the veins against the flow of blood: and they do this with Tyrian alfrache and sagzenea when it is placed on the site.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 Blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If a large abscess occurs at the site of phlebotomy, which often happens especially for those who are not used to phlebotomy or where there is a small wound in the vein, then hurry and place a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated slightly, on the site, and keep it on for an hour: because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 It is necessary that you do this after the blood leaves from the vein itself when it has finished, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something remains in the site after several days that is black or green, it does not harm it: and if you wish, place on top of it some aloe, myrrh dissolved, or something from the juice of mint, that is, camphor or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And indeed often occur abscesses and swellings at the venepuncture site in the Basilica (Church).
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Place your hand upon it (the swelling), then if you find a soft spot beneath your pressure, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Be careful, so that you place something on it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood of the artery may flow out from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make an ointment for it with the substance containing styptic (a substance that stops bleeding), so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 It is necessary that you draw out blood from every person according to the quantity of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears as a color spreading on top of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it flow out until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 It is necessary for the one who is full, strong and requires bloodletting, that it be done once, to increase the venepuncture of the vein, and that the bloodletter be on the side; and for the weak one, it should be the opposite.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 It is necessary that it be drawn from the veins and that the opening be narrow; and better that which is administered in venepuncture, that it be a cross-section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 This method of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And to the one who often faints upon venepuncture, it is necessary that before bloodletting he eat a little bread soaked in water of mulled honey; or if he is warm, let him drink cool water; and draw blood from three or four veins.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 If it is of cold constitution, then let it take bread soaked in honey-syrup or in scented honey-syrup with spices, or in fragrant aromatic syrup, before phlebotomy.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If it occurs that syncope happens during phlebotomy and the cause of this is excessive bleeding, then it is necessary that one drinks meat water and subtle aromatic syrup, and uses aromatics with alum and linens his chest with it, and uses the rest which we said in the division on syncope through evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 He who wishes to dislocate his arm and release blood through the second method: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for great evacuation and whose strength is weak, that he releases blood gradually by the amount of its strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 But he who wishes to dislocate his arm and release blood through the second method, and his body is strong: then let him do this after seven or nine hours following his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 He who wishes to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side of which it inclines: it is necessary that this be done on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In a body where much blood is already heated and sharpened and causes a fever: it is necessary that the blood comes out once and a large quantity is extracted from him; the opening is enlarged until syncope occurs; after which you should observe all conditions of phlebotomy; and you should place your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 For it often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and falls due to neglect.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 It is not appropriate when you wish to cut the arm, and to let out blood when the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of the blood becomes difficult, that you press strongly upon it and the bruised area is quickly extended.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 This is bad indeed, rather let it be, until it is bled again with the lancet.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Either remove with the sharpness of the lancet that which has coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place something dissolved in water over it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 Place something made of turpentine (tyriaca alfaroch) or sage (sagzenea), and place it gently on it until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if the vein is already tied off (apostemata), then let it be and do not cover it up until the tumor subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 If there is a need to let out blood by piercing again and no excuse for it, then either lance the same spot or pierce another vein on the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The ligament of the arm is lanced where Fusca and Basilica are located, and they cannot be found because they are composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the quality of lancing (phlebotomy) is that an unhealthy person should immerse his hand into hot water until it turns red, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then it should be tied with a cord of moderate tightness on top of it.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then the lance should be pierced across slightly, not widthwise or lengthwise; and the opening should be wide, and your lancing should be at a joint of the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If the flow of blood is forbidden, then immerse your hand in hot water and let the blood flow into the water until you fulfill your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 If, however, you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from the repetition of hands in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 Much more is the course of blood in hot water during winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And this vein's phlebotomy is safer than all the others, since it is not a pulsating vein and there is no nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 However, phlebotomy of the little finger on the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the quality of its phlebotomy is that you should tie the thumb with a ligature or your hand after you insert it into hot water, until the vein is inflamed and shown very clearly.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then, make an incision across it (the inflamed vein).
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you cut it entirely, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 Keep it (the instrument) so that you do not lose your hand with the phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For under it (the incision) there are exposed nerves of the fingers.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then dip your hand again in hot water and let the blood flow out in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not repeat it (the procedure) in hot water, the blood coagulates in the vein's opening and prevents its flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 Therefore, when you extract the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein to prevent it from clotting quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, it is necessary that you do this with every constricted branch (of veins).
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 However, the benefit of this phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is beneficial for spleen diseases; and do the same in its phlebotomy as you did in the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The benefit of the saphenous vein phlebotomy is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as uterine diseases, menstrual retention, kidney weaknesses, and old sores of hips and legs, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	The quality of phlebotomy is such that the unwell person should immerse his foot in warm water; and he should make friction over it until the veins swell; and tie above the joint of the foot with a ligature.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 The vein location is at the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and it branches out from there into many veins on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 So, phlebotomy should be performed in a larger vein branch or at the heel in its accumulation; because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If phlebotomy is performed on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are under it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 Place your phlebotomy instrument across [the vein], as if you want to cut it; and the phlebotomist should be named Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If the exit of blood is forbidden, then immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the phlebotomist misses a vein during the first attempt, then he should move the phlebotomy upwards a little; because it is safer and you need not fear harm from it, as long as you are careful around the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel from the forest side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 The aid for this phlebotomy is for pain in the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 The quality of this phlebotomy is that the unwell person should enter the bath and hurry; and tie his leg from the side of the ankle up to the heel with a thin, long bandage, without it being apparent except for that reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears, then perform the venesection according to whatever skill is possible for you, either by transverse or longitudinal manner: and it is better, or as if you cut it with an incision, or sever it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 Its position is safer, and it is very much hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the senses: then perform venesection on one of its branches, and that which appears on the back of the foot and turned towards the auricle: and avoid the nerves, and let the quantity of blood flow as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then dissolve the constriction, and place skin over the venesection site, and tighten the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 It heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 On Ventosection, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 They are made from horns, and from copper, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And Venosection is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With scratching and bloodletting; and the other is venosection without scratching.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this Venosection which is without scratching, is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the venosections that are administered with scratching and bloodletting are fourteen in number on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One is Ventosection of Alnocrates, and it is the last of the head; Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; ventosections of Alhagdahim, and they are two plates of the neck from both sides simultaneously; ventosections of the brain, and it is under the mandible on the lower jaw; ventosections of two spoon-like areas; ventosection of Alachosos over the end of the tail; ventosections of two faucets, and they are in the middle of two arms; ventosections of two legs; ventosections of two ankles.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And Ventosatio does not draw blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore its virtue does not fall out of them, as is the case with that accident from phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary to administer ventosatio, whether with fire or without it, in any disease that occurs due to congestion, until the whole body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity requires ventosation due to disease or custom, we administer it at the beginning, at the end, and in the middle of any month, and at any time whatsoever.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 Because there are some people who, when their blood multiplies, until it requires the extraction of it by ventosation, find in their head a heaviness and swelling.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And among them are those who find congestion and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And among them are those who find itching in their face, forehead, and darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And among them is one who scratches the place of his ventosation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And among them are those whose laughter is increased.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And among them are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth: or their tongue is pushed out, and the blood is spat out.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And among them are those whose sleep is increased.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And among them are those who see in their sleep blood and redness, and the dead, and wounds, and similar things.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When we see something from these, especially if it is during the middle of the third month: then we order ventosation to be done, after two or three hours have passed since that day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The advantage of ventosation for the neck is that it relieves heaviness in the head, and what is discharged goes to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 It is necessary for it to be afterwards, after evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And this, indeed, is a ventosus in place of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And it is not allowed to use that one who has cold constitution or where there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 For it does great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And because of that, it is not necessary to use that in old people and where there is cold illness of the head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 Whoever becomes accustomed to it, generates oblivion upon him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And because of that, you must warn the ventosator to put his hand down when performing ventosus for a moment, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Ventosation or Alkehel, is in place of phlebotomy Fusca, phlebotomy Basilica and because of that it causes coughing, constriction of breath, breathing of the instrument's crack, coughing, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it is necessary to push ventosation Alkehel for a moment, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness of the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 Ventosation alhagdahim causes accidents of pain in the head, migraine, hemigraine, perforation, and pain in the roots of teeth; and is in place of phlebotomy Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And you must warn the ventosator not to press his hand during scarification, so as not to cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Ventosation under the chin causes alcohol in the mouth, corruption of gums and similar illnesses that are in the mouth; and it is instead of phlebotomy aleierich which are on the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Ventosation of spatula causes alchafacham, which is caused by bending and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Internal cauterization of two hot irons provides assistance to phlebotomy of three veins, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica; because it draws blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh; and those small veins draw from other larger veins until the attraction reaches three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And it is necessary that you instruct the cauterizer not to proceed too much in scraping; because the place is exposed to flesh and there are nerves and arteries beneath it.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 And a Ventosa that evacuates (cauterizes) on anuses provides assistance to hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 And it is necessary that you instruct the cauterizer that the Ventosa should be large and of iron; because the place requires strong suction, and perhaps small Ventosas may break; and it should be scraped with a deep scraping.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 The cauterizations of the legs diminish by a clear reduction; because they draw blood from the entire body, and provide ancient pains in the kidneys, womb, and bladder; they induce menstruation, and provide gout and dropsy; and they are in place of phlebotomy of two saphena veins and alhorcoben.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 Nevertheless, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the aid of a Ventosa for alhorcoben is close to the aid of Ventosas for the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the positioning of Ventosas is that you place the Ventosa first in a vacant area and suck with moderate suction; and do not prolong the positioning of the Ventosas, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that humors come to the place at equal intervals; and do not stop repeating this and continuing, until you see the place already redden and swell, and the redness appears as blood; then scrape, and repeat suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in the arrangement (or disposition) of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For one who is of tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary to incise (him) once, not more; so that the place does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And order the Wind-blower (the person using a bellows) to enlarge the incision and not to penetrate too deeply; and moderate the suction in ease, speed, and gentle movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is a thickening in blood, then it is necessary to incise (him) twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 In the first (incision), the way is opened for subtle bleeding and its moisture; and in the second (incision) it is scrutinized for the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 But if the blood is very foul, then let there be an incision in the third (time); so that it may follow the last (procedure).
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And for the ultimate (purpose), when we wish to draw out blood slowly or slightly, it is sufficient for us with one incision.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we wish to extract much blood, let there be multiple incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick; then it is necessary to incise deeply; and the end equal in the incision, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 [Paragraph] What that should be administered from the oils for the position of the Bellows-blower, and what the Bellows-blower should beware of.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and the pores of it are narrow, the Bellows-blower should be anointed with oils that are opening, soothing, resolving; if it is in the summer (time), as oil of aloe, or oil of walnut, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is in the winter (time), then use oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or mustard; and similar to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If there is excessive fat, cold: then use oil of amoracchia, or oil from balsam, or white oil, or oil of anise; and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If there is much wind in the large pores of the flesh: then it must be forbidden from oil, and it must be washed those places of wind (after wounding) with rose water, or cold water, or sea water, or cucumber water, or portulaca water; and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 He whose blood is of much moisture, wash (the wound) with vinegar, or with water of myrtle and sumac; and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 He whose exudations are excessive and thick, wash (the wound) with old wine, or with juniper water, or decoction of anise, or chamomile; and similar ones.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 It must be avoided that wounding in a bath or in the foot of the bath; rather it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour or two.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And it is not allowed for anyone to sleep after wounding.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 Chapter: What must be done to regulate the wind or the lancer before wounding.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And afterwards, it must be considered firstly: if the wind or the lancer is choleric and its sharpness and inflammation prevail over the blood; then it must receive cooling agents, such as grape molasses; also a paste with vinegar and lettuce, radish, juniper, and yarrow; and similar ones.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 And place his food with chickpeas, cooked sheep meat, and preserved foods with vinegar; and similar ones.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 And if his complexion is cold, let him drink syrup made from honey or almond, or yarrow decoction made from seeds; and let him drink moderately aged wine that is between old and new; and it is prescribed that he should eat sparingly.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 Place his food with the chickens, and let it hatch; and sparrows, that is, small birds; and doves' chicks should be sprinkled upon it.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 It is necessary that the drink on the day of ventilation and phlebotomy should be more than the food; it is necessary to give something in the drink for some people in hours of tyriaca alfaroch, or medicine from musk, that is, muscata, or aleselithe before ventilation; and before or after: so that the main limbs may be strengthened, and the blood may become more subtle.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it is not necessary to take it in a heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Chapter on ventilation without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Ventosations that are without scarification are those placed on the liver, spleen, foot, and on the abdomen, umbilicus, places of kidneys, and on the groin; because these members do not bear scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 And it is not sought through them, unless by attraction of blood from one member to another; as we place ventilation on the breasts in sickness of flow of blood in the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to dispel cold and unpleasant wind from one member into another; as we place ventilation on the abdomen and umbilicus.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it rarifies the member, warms it up, and removes pain, because it dissipates that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 It is also placed on the kidneys when it happens to them obstruction, or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 By its virtue perhaps it opens obstruction, or extracts the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly when placed on the liver and spleen for bruising in them in both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 These ventosations are administered empty, excepting only with incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And at times they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And at times they are filled with warm water in cases of pleurisy: and this is for the purpose of inflating the ventosa (bladder), and it should be large, hot water alone, or water in which herbs that agree have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 Form of the ventosa administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 Its width should be two fingers open, as we have made it; and its depth should be half a palm; and on its side there should be a small hole in the middle of its length, according to the size that the needle can enter: it should be made of brass or citrine, with rounded edges, equal ones, cleaned: so as not to injure the body in its position above it; and in the middle of it, a bar transverse from brass or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now this ventosa is made large, larger than we have described, but not much smaller than that, according to the severity and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 For the ventosa for children, and for those exhausted (faint), are different from the ventosa for men and large-bodied people.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of placing this ventosa on the body with fire over it is to light a linen cloth or a small candle from wax; and place it on the middle transverse bar that is in the middle of the ventosa: so that the fire is lit below the lower part of the ventosa, so that the weak body is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then place it on the body: let the finger be over the hole that I have said, until we hold the ventosa; when we need to, remove the finger, and steam will come out of the hole, and the ventosa will immediately open.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then light a linen cloth according to its way, and repeat it if necessary.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 In Ventosa that is administered for the sickness of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod nor hole: it is not administered unless because it is filled with water and placed only on a limb.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And the size of the Ventosa, insofar as it is larger to hold much water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 Chapter on Suspension (of Sanguisugum).
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter CXIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Sanguisuge are not administered in many places except where the position of veins is not possible, due to their small size, such as lips, gums, and similar areas.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 In a body part devoid of flesh, such as fingers, nose, and similar areas.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the quality of their use is: to use venom from leeches that are in sweet clean water, free from decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they should be released day and night in sweet water until they are hungry and there remains nothing in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Afterwards, the body is bled first with phlebotomy, and then with cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then cleanse the sick part until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Then place them on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are full and fall off and there is a possibility of sucking the wound with cupping, then it is more advantageous to help: and if not, cleanse the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then with much water, rub and press.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the flow of blood persists after the removal of leeches and it needs to be stopped: then immerse a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top until the bleeding stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If there is an increase in blood, then sprinkle powdered alum or gall nuts or similar substances from poppy seeds on it until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or place half-peeled beans on the area and let them remain until the beans stick to the area; as the blood stops flowing.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And it is necessary that if the application of leeches is repeated, they should be changed when possible.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 If leeches are forbidden from suspension, then cleanse the area with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or fix a needle in the areas until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then they are placed, for they themselves feel something from the blood, and immediately adhere to it.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When you wish that they should fall, sprinkle some powder from ground aloes, or salt, or ashes upon them; and they will fall immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 Universal Discourse on the Repair, Dislocation and Healing of Twisting, and Similar Matters.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine and it is a repair of broken bones and dislocations of joints in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know ye, O sons, that fools among doctors and the common people boast about this chapter; and those who have never seen the book of the ancients, nor read a single letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And because of this reason, this method is scarce among the learned in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never found any good in it; nor have I acquired that knowledge from it except for the length of reading ancient books and diligence in understanding them until I extracted the knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I have attached myself to experience and diligence throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 Now I have described for you from that in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge; and beyond what my experience has passed over, after I abridged it for you, and freed it from the occupation of prolongation, and abridged it with the end of abridgement, and showed its end with a descent; and I have formed many forms of instruments used in it, since it is by adding to declination, as I did in two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 Summary and Collection of Fractures of Bones, from which a preliminary is necessary before we begin the remembrance of broken limbs and various ones, if any one in particular.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary, as I shall say in the preface of this Chapter, that the main points and sections, to which the understanding of the craftsman must first be directed concerning their truth: namely, that you and those quick to learn know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 I say therefore, that when a fracture, dislocation, twist or accident happens to someone, it is necessary then, first of all, to phlebotomize him and dissolve it, or both at the same time: unless something forbids it, such as weakness of virtue; or he who is affected by one of these things is a boy, an old man decrepit, or it is a time of violent heat or violent cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, beans and hare; and let wine, thick meats and filling foods be prohibited, and let the belly not be filled with them or any food that fills veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until you are secure from a warm purge and do not fear the emission of matter to the limb; then let the sick person return first to his own regimen, with which his custom has been accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary for the sick person to eat nutritious foods in abundance, thick, heavy, containing viscosity; such as food made from cooked wheat with water, rice, heads and feet of cattle, entrails of sheep, eggs, fresh fish, and thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 With this regimen, the setting of the fracture is done more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that broken bones in men who are old and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be held together and consolidated according to their own nature always, due to the drying out of their members; and they are consolidated and joined in the end of softness, like the bones of small boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 Nevertheless, nature connects something similar to glue around the broken bone from every side, which has a thickness, by which it adheres and tightens it until they are united, and bound together until it reaches the end of its strength and firmness, just as it was in the beginning, until it does not prevent anything from its operations: and for this reason, it is necessary that you place nourishment for the weak, in which there are heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And know, that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs: since a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head: and a fracture of the bone of the chest is different from a fracture of the bone of the back: and similarly all other limbs are diverse one from another: and I come with the reminder of every type of fracture exposed in its chapter distinct from the others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 And the types of bone fractures are also divided within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Since it happens that the fracture is bowed, apart from the fact that stars occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes the fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures called stars, that is, small star-like pieces, or additions extending, like in a reed when it is prepared with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not extending: and there is the fracture with wound and separation in the head: and there is a small crack-like fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And every type has its own skill or tool for restoration, according to how the memory of it will come, separated in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from this it is known that the bone fracture is twisted and its protuberance: and its appearance to the sense and sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When there is no apparent tortuosity in the location, nor does striking the bone with movement produce sound for you, nor does a weak person experience great pain: then there is no fracture there; rather, it is possible that there may be tortuosity or a small fissure. Therefore, it is not necessary to move it with your hand and compression at all; instead, place something from the medicines whose memory comes to mind on top of it for a while until the appropriate time arrives: then tighten the dressing with subtle pressure.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And you should know that when a location arches and is split into two, but except for the occurrence of satagiae, all parts are removed from their original position; then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour for its correction, applying pressure on it before a hot abscess occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If however, there arises a hot abscess, then let it be for several days until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then apply pressure on it according to whatever means possible from lenity and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And you should know that the restoration of it, and its setting, is easier than the bone in which satagiae occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then tighten it according to whatever memory comes to mind of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If there are satagiae in the bone, then it is necessary for extension of this broken member from both sides, if the hand is available or the foot; or with your hand, if the member is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And your position when placing the member over the place should be equal according to its natural shape until the parts of the broken member extend; then attempt to return those additions with all skill and in whatever way you can in their places: but be careful according to your strength, that pain or injury does not occur to the weak from your operation; and attempt according to your strength to apply one bone of the two with its companion, according to the best shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 It is necessary at that hour, that you probe and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and make it even with the measure of your force.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And beware of a violent extension, and a strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For often, through their operation, they make an abscess hot, or a contraction in the limb; as we have already seen this frequently happen from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then bind after it has been made even, and a proper operation, and a tightening of that limb; and peace, and calmness; and warn the sick person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And make him take care not to move it during his watchful hours, and sleep, at the time of its revolution, and his agitations, and during fasting, and all his movements with the last of his strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And to avoid a position of the limb that follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 That is because when he feels pain or injury in the position of a limb, then it must be moved to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And beware that the position of his is even and straight; to avoid twisting in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of the tightening of a broken limb is as I have said.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that broken limbs are classified according to their smallness, size, and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Those which are small, such as the arm, finger, foot, and similar, then it must be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 Those which are large, such as the thigh and leg, it must be a wide, hard wrapping.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Because the broad ligament connects a large member and tightens it from all sides equally, so that no spot enters into it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then begin, after your evacuation, to place the suitable poultice on it, on soft wool over the site of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin to wind the ligament over the site of the fracture with three or four layers, according to how deserving the member is; and tighten your hand slightly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then go with it to the upper part above the site of the fracture and tighten less than your previous tension, which you had applied on the fractured site.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then withdraw with the bandage from the site of the fracture slightly, and soften the tension gradually, until you take out a large amount from a healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then receive another plaster, and wind it again over the fractured site with bandages.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Then go with the bandage to the lower part below the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your operation be in the tension of the bandage and the softening of it, according to what we said in the upper bandaging.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the bandages, from soft wool or cloth, which fits the curvature of the fracture if there is any curvature; and if not, you do not put anything on it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then wind over another plaster.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Then place stars evenly on top of these bandages, immediately if there is no swelling or hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 If there is swelling or an abscess in it: then place on it what removes that abscess, and remove the swelling; and let it be for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then tighten the stars on top of it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 And let the stars be from the middle sections of a wide reed, shaved and shaped wisely; or let them be made of wood from which cribra are made, which are made from pine, yew, that is, palm branches, or calingi; and let the size of every star be according to this shape and the same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary that the Astal (clamp) placed on the tract be slightly larger and broader than the others: and the length of the Astal should be according to what is allowed by the size and smallness of the member.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then tie over the clamps with another lint, according to the first tying.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then bind above with threads properly, according to what we said about the tying: and it is, that your binding on the site of the fracture should be more: and as much as it is farther from the fracture, the binding should be less.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 It is necessary that the threads be of medium thickness and fineness, and made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 Because if the threads are thick, as I saw in the operation of foolish ones placing their threads from twisted flax ropes, there is a great mistake: because the binding falls with them outside of quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And very fine threads again do not suit: because you will not gain by the binding with them what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth between one clamp and another.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the sick person is injured by the ends of the clamps after the binding at healthy places: then put under them from soft wool or camel's wool until nothing is injured from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 When there is a fracture with wound and disruption occurs in the skin, I shall come with the discussion of it in the second chapter according to its peculiarity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken member should be bound with clamps from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 Because when the member is large, it is not necessary to place clamps on top of it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the occurrence of a hot ulcer.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is the method of plasters, which were used by the ancients, which are placed on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 Common method of emplastrum abbreviated, restoring a fracture, suitable for various temperaments, particularly women and children: because it is from that which heat does not prevail, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And is, as you receive from the flour mill, and it is the kernel of the grain that hangs on the walls of the mill near the motion of the grinder; and prepare it thus, except that sieve it with egg white; and place its mixture not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another method of emplastrum, restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Take almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath; squeeze them all with a quantity of myrrh equal to 10, and aloes from both equal to 5, and alethil 20 times; grind all of them, sift them, and mix them with water of alethil; or with egg white if the temperament of the patient is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this emplastrum.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is of good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method of emplastrum, which also benefits a fracture and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Take mugath, mess, white altea, all of them with a quantity of myrrh equal to 10, and aloes from both equal to 5; Armenian pine nuts 6 times; grind all of them thoroughly, sift them, and prepare with water, or egg white; administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another method of emplastrum for joints and bones separated from their places; it relieves the pain that occurs to them, and cuts (cure) a broken bone.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take cooked wool, immerse it in vinegar, and boil it in oil; place it on the location.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 And in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good for the sedation of a hot abscess; and it drives pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Method of the plaster that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take leaves of the deaf fig and leaves of the wild parsley; grind all of them, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Method of the quick-healing plaster for use in the restoration of a bone fracture; and whenever you wish to soften the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Take equal parts of the root of althea, chamomile, violets and dried herb flour; grind them all together and make a paste with wine if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is heated, then make that paste with coriander water or with water and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another stronger method for softening a hard abscess when there is a restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Take equal parts of the root of althea, flax seeds, balustium, lentils, vetch, samsucca, violets and chamomile; grind them all together and make a paste with willow water or sweet water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Apply it according to the heat of the member and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 But Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on a fractured member during its restoration unless it is made of wax and oil; nothing else; and he said that it should be between coarseness and finesse.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galenus, however, thought that resins should be placed on a fractured member during its restoration, in which there is an evaporation of heat, such as myrrh and aloes and frankincense and similar things from those we mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Method of Plastering for Wound and Pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Make paste with chickpeas, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, althea, and equal parts of salt. Grind them well and sieve it, then prepare plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 But the amount required so that there remains binding, then it is to be dissolved, is such that you consider if no pain occurs, nor itching, nor is the bone displaced from its place: then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If itching or pain or swelling occurs at the site: then hurry and dissolve it at that hour itself, remove the plaster from it; and take a soft cloth or sea sponge, wet it with warm water; and wash the place with it until the itching subsides and the pain is soothed.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place on top of it a piece of thin wool, soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil; and bind it over it for the night until you are sure of removing the heat from the wound, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and the pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the process for a fine binding and small plaster; do not bind it tightly with your own binding or with thin ones until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all the conditions have been completely removed; if you need plaster and binding, then repeat it as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing happens to the limb from what we said, then do not dissolve it unless after three days or four or five or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it [the fracture] is released after twenty days, according to what appears to you from the solution of the limb, as we said, until when the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh approaches it: add also then in the stricture more than your first stricture; and add also in the swelling of food for the sick, according to what preceded the remembrance of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If you see that the place of the fracture is already drying out and becoming thinner than it should be: then know that nutrition is forbidden to reach it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Apply the embrocation itself with warm water at every place where you solve it, and let it be for all three days, and alleviate the stricture slightly.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 Through this operation, nutrition flows to the limb, and it is healed quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 But what the foolish restorers do instead of restoring a fractured limb when it should not be restored first, according to what is necessary, and they restore it according to its crookedness, is an error from their operation, and there is great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said that in their books, and they would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I did not see any trace of theirs at all in that, and it is better not to do it.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 Chapter on making a fracture in the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 The species of fractures are diverse, and the forms of it many; and the causes of it are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For from a fracture is that which happens from a blow with a sword; and the blow takes away the bone completely until it reaches the saphec, which is under the bone, just as an ax does in wood; and because of this it is called this species of fracture "Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 The knife cut something of the bone and cut its face, but did not penetrate through the incision to its end; this type of fracture is called Kalan, that is, Absolute Lever.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And it is a wound of two kinds of fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And from the fracture is one that is a crushing or grinding; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this fracture is also penetrating, which approaches the cloth that is under the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone; and it is a wound of these two kinds of fractures, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And from the fracture is one that is hidden inside the bone in its subtlety (porosity); and it is a small crack; and for this reason this type of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And from these (kinds of fractures) is a fracture that occurs due to a fall or blow of a stone and similar things, which cause the bone layer to penetrate inside; and this creates a hollow: as it happens with caldrons of metal when they are struck, and part of them penetrates inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 And this occurs most often in the soft bones of the head, such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And all these types of fractures (are treated) with splints applied separately; and I will return when reminded of the whole in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 We recognize all these types of fractures by examination on it, and investigation of them with probing tools, and removal of corrupted flesh that is on top of them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The Capillary type is recognized by the fact that it protrudes from the bone and is scraped off, and is bound over it with a hot iron; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the conditions of the sick person: then, if you see among the conditions that indicate fear, such as cholera vomiting, extension, loss of intellect, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, eye discharge, redness of eyes, and similar conditions in many dispositions, there is no doubt that it will not heal: and if you see conditions that do not frighten you, and hope for recovery: then begin the treatment of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 If a wounded person comes to you, first know that it happens during the winter days: then, it is necessary for you to study the removal of bone before the fourteenth day according to all dispositions.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 And if it is during summer days, then you must hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from fat becomes rotten, and those conditions that I mentioned occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If the fracture of a bone has already reached the fat touching the brain, and it is with cracks and adhesion: then you must cut the broken and smoothed part according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And it is to shave the head of the wounded person and scrape above the bone as much as possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light on the sick one.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If blood flow or a hot abscess happens to you during the scraping of bone: then apply what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is to fill the place with soaked rags in wine and rose oil: and let the wound rest until the abscess settles down, and be safe from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin the treatment and removal of the bone.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 A method exists, to cut a bone with an incisor of a rigid blade: and this is its shape.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Another way to administer the Incisorium after the Incisors wider by a small amount, and this is its shape.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then also administer another Incisorium wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is, that there be with you a number of various Incisoriums; some of which are wider than others, and some of them shorter than others: and they should be at the end of their sharpnesses, and made of Indian iron or bronze: and use them with ease in striking on an Incisorium, so as not to strike the head, and hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If however the bone is hard: then it is necessary that you bore around its circumference before you administer Incisoria with Terebris which are not too deep; and they are not called this unless because these do not penetrate beyond the bone's marrow to that which is beyond it, because a Terebra is rounded at the top of what is under the head, sharp like an edge, similar to a small circle, preventing immersion and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it is suitable for you that you take a large number of those Terebris, each one fitting the thickness of the bone, until you have with you all Terebris of the skull: whose sharp edges' length and width should correspond to the thickness of the skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the shape of three types of Terebris or Trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of boring around a broken bone is: that you place the Terebra on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the position of the Terebra to another place and put one that is between every hole with the size of a finger or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with the incisors that which is between every opening in the bone; make this as delicate as you can above it from the edge of tenderness, as we said, until you root out the bone, either with your hand or with some other instruments which you have prepared for this purpose: such as tenaculae and subtle forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And be careful to avoid the Terebrum or the Incisorium from touching the siphac.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When you surround the bone by piercing it and it has been separated from the siphac if it is continuous with it and you pull it out, it is necessary that you root and even out the remaining extremity of it in the bone with another similar instrument like the Incisorium.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 However, it should be thin and delicate more than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If something remains of the small bones and cartilages; then take these with ease along with that which is at hand among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then care for the wound after this with linen cloths and the ointments which we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 Another method of operation is easy, entirely remote from fear; this one has been said by Galen and he praised it greatly; and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 First, it is necessary for you to begin by exposing the bone in the place where the fracture is more violent and more apparent; until when you have exposed this part, and placed under it the extremity of this curved incisor, which has this shape: lenticular.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And the lenticular part does not cut anything; and the sharp part of it goes in two sides of it in length, as you see; so that the lenticular part is attached to the siphac with the sharp end falling on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike the incisor from one side with a small hammer until you cut the whole bone easily, as it is turned; and you should be careful from the cloth that it does not happen what you fear completely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 If the physician were not the most foolish of men, and more ignorant than he should be, nor sleeping, then if something attached to the bone from a fold remained in certain places, it would strike off that part along with the lenticular incisor, and release it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It is freed without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If a bone fracture does not penetrate the flesh and what is to be cut away from the bone remains in it, then there will remain roughness and subtle protrusions; then you must smooth out that roughness, and dig out those subtle protrusions with finer scrapers which you have prepared in various quantities, so that it is possible for you to apply them more conveniently in every place according to the shape to which the operation leads and the fractured bone and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And you must administer it according to your own reasoning, in the first place scraping the bone more widely than those scrapers.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer tool after that one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not cease doing this continuously until you reach the point of administering it more narrowly and finer than all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 In each of the remaining small fissures and subtle fractures, care must be taken according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And there is a matter which does not escape the notice of any who have studied this art, and it remains over what we wrote and showed about large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If the flesh is detached when you scrape the bone, then you must take a piece of linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth: and do that as easily as possible without burdening the wound.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then apply a broad bandage over it: and do not tighten it unless in such quantity as holds the wound only: and leave it with this care for one day or two until you are assured of being free from hot suppuration.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it, and apply afterwards medicines with which excessive dryness is required: such as the roots of garlic, and the flour of herbs, and the powder of incense, and aristolochia, and similar ones: and there is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is to be sprinkled on the wound like those that are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And universally apply to it every medicine of such a property as to cleanse and not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And be careful according to your skill, that the wound during your treatment is clean: and let there be neither ointment stains nor dirt.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 And let no pus accumulate in it at all: because when pus accumulates on the brain cloth, it corrupts it and rots it, and after that a great evil happens to the sick person: and it has already happened in the head wound, when the bone is cleansed from it, particularly when the care of it is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Therefore consider then, if what we have said happens to the sick person, know that it is certainly fatal.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine that is applied to it, and this medicine has the property to cause it: then you should receive one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and clean a cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it (the instrument) on the siphac (anus); afterwards take care of it with suitable medicaments until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 On the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the nose is not fractured except when both its upper parts are fractured at once, or only one of them; this is because it has two bones above: since below it is cartilaginous and does not break, but occurs only in attrition, curvature, and deviation.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of its two parts is fractured, then it is necessary to insert a small finger into the nose opening and equalize the fracture with your index and thumb on the outside until the nose returns to its natural shape; this should be done skillfully with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And beware that the pain does not worsen as a result of your operation on the sick person.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger does not reach it; then it is necessary to equalize the extremity of the radius, where there is a slight swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture is in both parts (of the nose), then do the same (as above); and proceed with the restoration of it on the first day of the fracture if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then wait for the seventh or tenth day in a warm room with plasters.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a piece of linen from a flax cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two pieces of linen if the fracture is in both parts: and let there be enough thickness in the linen to fill the nose opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some ancient restorers have said that the linen should be soaked in butter and changed daily.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 But I do not see it that way; on the contrary, it seems necessary to me that the linen should be soaked in egg white, made with milled flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then let the sutures (or ligatures) be removed when the bone is set and the cartilage hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a feather of a goose is introduced into the nose instead of a ligature; and it is wrapped in a soft cloth over it: so that it holds the broken part of the nose more strongly, and does not prevent it from being inspired.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this matter is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you wish, do that; and if you wish, do it with a ligature.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If the nose should happen to occur again while treating a warm boil, pack the nose with beeswax or with wax soaked in rose oil, or a little with dyaquilon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 If the boil is not warm, then it is necessary to pack it with sisa flour and turmeric powder mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft wad on top of it and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If the bones of the nose are broken in a small fracture or crushed, then it is necessary to cut above them and remove them with instruments suitable for the task.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then suture it and take care of it with suitable packing or ointment until it heals.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If a wound occurs between the nose and lip, then treat it with linen cloth, and administer a lead cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Chapter on Restoring the Lower Jaw when it is Broken.
Caput V.	 Chapter V:
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is ruptured and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then observe if its fracture is only on the outside and it is not broken into two pieces and it bends toward the inside; then recognition of it is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 If the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, insert your left index finger into the weak jaw; similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, insert your right index finger; and push the swelling of the fracture towards the outside with ease using your other hand from the inner part of the bone properly, and press it evenly.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer extension from both sides according to correctness; until possible alignment can be achieved.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If it happens that the teeth have been moved or disrupted; then tie them with a thread of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place over the broken jaw a piece of lead.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place over it a double cloth and place on the cloth a large well-made awl or a piece of shoe leather equal in length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then tie it up above as you have prepared its binding and the application is appropriate until it does not break; and order the patient to rest calmly and quietly; and place his soft foods for him.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If you think that something has changed in the shape in some way; then hurry and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then rectify what has changed from it, and plaster it with flour milled powder mixed with egg white or wheat flour after you have removed the lead; and place a soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While that plaster remains attached to it, and the bone arrangement does not change, leave it be, do not remove it until it heals; or tie up the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 This fracture is tied many times during three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If a warm abscess occurs in the meantime, then administer what we have said many times for its soothing until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if there is a fracture with a wound, take note.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 But if a fragment is separated from the bone, or a cyst: then be careful in this matter, so that you remove those fragments of the cyst with what suits you for their removal from your instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If the wound's opening is narrowed, then expand it with a leech according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you have removed the cysts and nothing remains of them, or if the wound's opening is wide: and if not, place over it a plaster that suits for this purpose, and let it heal until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 [Section heading] On the repair of a Fork-bone (Furculum), when it breaks.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 The furcula (clavicle) is broken most frequently from the anterior part, and its fracture occurs in one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 It can be broken and separated into two, apart from what is known as a stump fracture: it is easier to restore this kind of fracture.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or, it can happen on the bone of the stump fracture: it is more difficult to restore this kind.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or, it can be a fracture accompanied by a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 The operation in this case, when the furcula is broken without a wound, is to have two assistants present. One should hold the broken furcula and the other should stretch out the neck towards that side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then, with your fingers, straighten the fracture so that it takes the proper shape, and there should be no prominence nor hollow in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If more extension is needed, then you must place a small ball under the weak person's pillow, made of cloth or wool; its size should be according to your need; and stretch, lift and move the furcula around the ball with your hand until the fracture is straightened, as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot pull the end of the furcula to the outside due to it reaching deep inside, then the weak person should lie on their back; and place a small wooden plank under their shoulder in size; and press the assistant's arm towards the bottom, until the furcula bone is lifted from the depth towards the top; and then straighten the fracture and align it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If you feel a stump from the furcula and it moves, then you should press on it and remove the stump easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If it is retained in the bone, then make an incision with one of the instruments you have prepared for this purpose; after placing a tool under the furcula to protect the sifach (sore or inflamed tissue); and the tool is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a snail shell without a cavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And let its width be according to the need for it based on the size of the bone and its proportions.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 The length [of the wound] should also be, as far as possible, for your operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 It has two ends, as you see: one end is broad, and the other is narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If the tear in the wound that you split when removing the sathaiatum bone is broad, and you have scissors at hand: then gather together two lips of the wound with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 If [the tear] is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and with as many sutures as the size of the wound requires.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If a hot abscess occurs, then soak cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 But the suture of a bone without a wound and without a cut is to place plaster made from milled flour with egg white on it.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 Place a soft woolen cloth over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place a bladder beneath it, if necessary.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a bloodletting instrument, that is, the Saracenic roll, which should be very long: and its width should be about the length of one palm, or approximately that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place a double suture on top of the woolen cloth and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take an awl from a thin board whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then thrust it into the cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then thrust the cloth with the awl into the place of the bleeding and the fracture.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place the bleeding on the fracture as is customary, and thrust it onto his neck, and under a healthy bladder, and under an unhealthy bladder: and pull it over all parts, and in such a way that the suture holds the fracture tightly: and this is what you must not hide from yourself, and everything, so that the awl does not move away from the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 It is necessary to look at the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Every time the bandage is softened and you see the splinter being removed, then correct it and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the sick man's sleep on his back, and put a small pillow under his head near his sleep, so that when he is awakened, help may be brought to him from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Then raise the fracture of the collarbone by elevating the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage unless it happens in a place happening due to itching, or from an abscess, for up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see his face turning towards that (the affected area).
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add to the compression, and let it remain until it is restored and healed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 The fracture of the collarbone is compressed and supported for up to twenty days; and sometimes it happens in less time in some people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 Chapter on the restoration of the fracture of the spatula (pelvis).
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 A spatula rarely breaks and at its wide place; and it is not broken from it except for its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When it breaks from that place and breaks in its middle, and it is not known except by touch; then make an attempt at the preparation of the fracture according to its shape.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And reduce it to its natural form in every possible way using your intelligence.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place on it the dust of a mill with egg white, and fine starch, and place above it a small cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place on top of it a broad awl from fine wood, according to the size of the spatula, or slightly larger than that.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If however there is a hollow under the awl on the spatula at some place, then fill that hollow with fine starch until the awl descends evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then bind it on top with long linen thread and a tight binding, and securely fix the awl until it cannot be moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And observe the binding every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever the binding becomes soft, tighten it and if the awl is moved from its place; let it lie weak on its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And indeed the spatula is restored within twenty days or within twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When this number has been completed, then loosen the binding; and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is from bones whose crushing or dissolution is not feared.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If however a piece of bone projects and pierces under the skin; then cut through it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as I said for a fracture at the neck of the clavicle from suppuration of an abscess; if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 Chapter on the restoration of a chest fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Title VIII. (direct literal translation from Latin)
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 Chest sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and it happens rarely. (direct literal translation from Latin)
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 The extremities indeed break most often, and they grind down due to accidents. (direct literal translation from Latin)
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When the middle breaks, which inclines towards the lower parts, and pain occurs to it, as well as difficulty in breathing, and a cough; and perhaps blood is vomited, and a hollow is shown in the broken bone, and it is not concealed from the sense, The restoration of this is that the weak lies on his back on his back: and place between its blades a poultice. (direct literal translation from Latin)
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press his shoulders, and join the ribs from two parts or sides with hands: and sharpen it in its equality, according to all means possible for this, until it returns to the figure of the bone, according to what is necessary. (direct literal translation from Latin)
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place upon him an emplaster and a woolen cloth, and place on top of it a star-shaped piece made from thin wood (or ivory or similar materials) on a pillow after you have wrapped it in a cloth. (direct literal translation from Latin)
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then sharpen it (the star-shaped piece) in binding it on the broken bone so that it is not removed; and go with the binding according to roundness towards the back several times, and tighten it properly with a proper ligature. (direct literal translation from Latin)
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the ligature at every hour, and whenever it becomes softened, tighten it; and if necessity arises for its solution in case of itching or corrosion that happens in the place, or pain, or abscess; then rush, and loosen it, and remove the emplaster, and correct what happened with the manner of treatment. (direct literal translation from Latin)
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then return the emplaster if you see it towards that face: and attach a ligature until it is healed. (direct literal translation from Latin)
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 On the restoration of ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	 De Cauterio et de Purgatione.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 You should know that the fracture of the collarbone does not occur except in large places following the back and from their extremities from the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 It does not happen to them (the fractures) by rubbing, unless it is because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 The knowledge of this (the fracture) is not hidden from the sense during examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And its restoration is made in such a way that the fracture is equalized with the fingers according to the possible method, until it is equal to the form as required.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then bandages (are applied) and tie the broken bone with a splint if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the fracture of the collarbone is sloping towards the inside: then it causes a severe pain to the weak, and punctures, like the puncture that occurs in one who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the pleura, and also it happens difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting blood frequently; and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancients have been skilled in this with many devices: and among them are those who say that you should give foods for the sick which produce inflammation and windiness, so that the stomach is inflamed, expanded, and pressed against the outside to move the fracture outwards.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 We (on the other hand) reject that a wound should be made quickly for making a hot abscess, unless it occurs.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If it has already occurred, then you add it (the hot abscess).
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them say: put a poultice on the place and then squeeze it with force, and it is more similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 Nevertheless, it is feared that poultices attract superfluous fluids to the place, because of its weakened condition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them say: the place should be covered with wool that has already been soaked in warm oil; and pebbles should be placed between the collarbones until it is filled up: so that the bandage is equal when it is wrapped around it according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then let the sick one be treated with a diet and medicine for pleurisy.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If the illness presses strongly upon the sick person and he cannot bear it, and the flesh is pricked with a lance or punctured by piercing, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary that we cut above the affected area and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we place upon it an instrument which is called a cauterizer, the use of which has been mentioned before: and we cut through the bone easily, and we make an incision in it itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we bring together two lips of the wound if it is large with a stitch: and let us treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If an abscess occurs meanwhile which is hot: then go quickly, and pour oil of roses into the pulules and place it on the site: and let the sick one be treated with what is suitable for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 Also at the same time let him lie down on his side upon which he sleeps until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 Chapter on the restoration of a fracture of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Fractures of the neck bones sometimes occur and rarely do they suffer abrasion; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 When that happens to someone, and he wishes to know whether it will heal or not: then consider this.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see his hands already softened and stunned and dead; and he cannot move them nor extend them nor contract them; and when you press on them with your fingers and prick them with a point, he does not feel it or feels pain in them: then you will know that it will not heal, and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If he moves them and feels their contraction with your fingers and pricking: then you will know that the neck bone is sound, and that the sick one will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If it happens with the back similar to that [symptom], and you wish to know whether it will heal or not: then consider his feet; then if you see that they have become softened, and what has happened in them is what has happened in the hands: then when it lies on its back, a discharge occurs without willingness, and hunger occurs without willingness; and when it lies on its abdomen, hunger occurs without willingness; and when it lies on its back and wishes to copulate, but cannot: then you know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Do not labor in treating it [the condition].
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 But if nothing of that kind happens to him, the case is less severe.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment of his condition that occurs from that is as follows: you should strive for cauterization with a hot emulsion; in this way, you place it upon a burnt Spondylus [fossilized vertebra] smeared with rose oil alone; or with wool soaked in goat's fat.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place it upon the same [affected area] several times a day, until when the hot cauterization is settled; then place on one of the soothing and drying plasters over that location and bind it with a bandage; and command the patient to rest quietly and tranquilly.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 Let him not sleep on the part where he found pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it happens during the rubbing of a separated saithaitum [type of bone] or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary to cut the skin over it and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with some incarnate substance, from ointments, until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 But if the last bone of the alhausos [type of bone] breaks and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the anus, and press the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible, according to what is feasible, and in a second attempt.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place it upon him, and remove it; and heal the wound with the treatment that preceded, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 On the Restoration of Anus.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Rare are the bones of anchors broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they break, then their fracture is not, unless a comminution occurs at their extremities; and they are cut in length and bend towards the interior; and it happens that a weak pain occurs at the location, and puncturing; and the limb which breaks becomes paralyzed.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And indeed its restoration is that you spread your hand over it until it comes to rest on the fracture in its shape.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only at its extremities, then adjust that fracture, according to what you prepare for yourself from the equation, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If the fracture is in length or already bends towards the interior, then make the weak one lie on his belly, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you have adjusted it, place a plaster over it; then place over it an asterisk made of wood or hide; and bind a bandage on top of it where you are not afraid of changing the fracture or removing the asterisk.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And adjust the concavity of them with it that fills it, until the bandage covers it according to the equality; and tell the weak one to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from its extension and its restoration until the hot abscess sits; and place over it what sits upon it as previously, then return to its restoration; and bind it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If a saw-bite occurs in the bone, or is comminuted, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Chapter on the restoration of the fracture of the arm (Adiutorius).
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The Adiutorium is that which is between the elbow and the head of the spatula (ulna).
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it therefore breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One of them is: take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness in the shape that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And tie two cords at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is suspended from a raised place, and the weak one should sit on a chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then throw your broken arm over the wood, until it reaches its tip, where the notch for the crack is attached to the middle of the stick.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then place something heavy above it, so that the wood extends towards the lower part.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 The physician then sets the break with his hands until it returns to its proper position.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 And another method is that the weak one lies down on his neck and suspends his hand from his neck with a cord.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then command two assistants to hold one of them above the break with their hands and for the other to hold below him, each extending to his side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 If you want the extension to be stronger, then tie something under the break with a cord and above it with another cord, and each of the two assistants should extend to his side.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If the break is close to the end of the arm, then a cord should be placed under the notch and another one facing the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly, if the break is close to the elbow, then a cord should be placed above that place and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then adjust the break easily without effort until it is aligned as required, and apply good pressure when it is so; then tie it if no warm abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 But if a warm abscess occurs, then leave the binding for seven days.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 Place a linen cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil over it until the abscess is still, then tighten it; the manner of tightening it is that you place plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then, place a new linen cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Next, lay the arm on top of this support, and place his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 Place a cloth and tighten around the support for the arm so that the arm remains in place like a star; unless he prohibits you from anything, or something from the broken bone alters above you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If you are afraid that something from the broken bone will alter above you, then use stars; it is to place over the fracture a larger and stronger star than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And place between each star a width equal to a finger; and the length of the stars should be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from all sides.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then tighten around the stars as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it is to be that your bandage around the fracture site is tighter than usual.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 The longer the fracture, the looser the bandage should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you see the placement of the stars and bandage as we have said, at the hour when you are to restore the member, then do it; if you fear a hot abscess, then release the bandage and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then, consider the ligature for three days so that itchiness, swelling, or food reaching the member does not occur due to the excess of the bandage's tightness.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore, correct everything as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If you are confident that nothing will occur from it, then do not loosen the bandage unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the weak man lie on his back and place his hands on his stomach; then put a full woolen bandage equally beneath it.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 And consider at all hours of the night or day that the figure of the broken member is not loosened, nor the ligament softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Therefore, correct it entirely with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 Place the food of the weak man according to the order which we have given, so that it is a subtle food first, until the bone begins to bind; then it is necessary to thicken his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For it is the custom of the support and the leg that it should be bound for forty days; therefore, when it has been bound, it must be loosened and administered a bath, and treated with ointments which correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the break is foul, scrape it; then do not loosen the bandage and the nails from it for fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Chapter on the restoration of the broken arm.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two ulnae.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One is small and it follows the little finger.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other one is large, and it is that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Perhaps it is broken with a mallet larger or smaller; and perhaps they are broken together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 When the mallet smaller is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the mallet below is broken, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 Worse it is, when two bones are broken together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If the bone that is broken is the mallet smaller above, then it is suitable for the doctor at its restoration, that he places an extension smaller with ease, until it matches itself.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 But if the mallet larger is what was broken: then it is necessary that he places a strong splint.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary that he places the shape of the hand at its restoration, and the extension extended over the wrist.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 And the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers; and the joint below all the fingers, or the rest: and the weak person sitting squared upon himself, and the wrist in front of him, or directly to his side, at a height, so that the weak person does not exert labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then the servant extends the arm from the lower part, or with his hand, or with a ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another servant extends above likewise.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the doctor aligns the bone until he brings it back to its best shape possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are splinters in a broken bone, then try to restore all the fragments in their place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 But if it appears that a splinter is separated and pierces the skin, and there is no hope of its restoration: then fill it over, and remove it according to the manner we have said in those which were mentioned previously.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If however a fracture is with a wound, I have already treated that chapter individually, therefore receive its cure from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then fold a cloth with wax made from rose oil, and white beeswax, with a medium thickness between thick and thin: tie the cloth over it with a fine string until when the abscess settles: then remove the wax, and place an ointment prepared from milled powder with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place a splint, and let the one placed over the fracture be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in various arrangements: or if it is a fracture in one splint, or in two splints simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place a stronger and more forceful bandage over the location of the fracture, and a little more with the bandage towards the upper part of the fracture, or towards its lower part: or place a softer bandage a little less, according to what was previously remembered in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And let the cloths that are wound over the fracture be soft, damp: and let them not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 Let the thread used for tying be of flax, medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 Consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something happens requiring correction, such as itching on a limb: then it is necessary that you warm the limb with hot embrocation until the itching subsides, and let the limb not bound until it subsides, then repeat the bandaging.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the bandage is already softened, and the bone removed, and similar things: then correct it all with your strength, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 If nourishment is prevented from reaching a member due to the excess of swelling, then it is necessary that you soften it slightly and release it for some days until it reaches the nourishment again, then tighten it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 If, however, none of what has been said occurs in the sick person, then it is not necessary that it be loosened, unless after twenty days or about this.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then the hand of the sick person shall be suspended at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let his neck be equal, and his strength be preserved from excessive movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 Make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 And know that this fracture is restored within thirty or thirty-two days; and it may perhaps be restored within twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 This entire matter is according to the dispositions of temperaments and the dispositions of powers.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 Chapter on the Restoration of Fractures (Hand).
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that the fracture of the hand with scissors and knots rarely occurs.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 It does not happen to him unless it is worn down many times.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When the fracture of the foot or the wearing down occurs, then it is necessary that the sick person sits squarely; and before him there should be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand on an extended surface.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then the assistant extends the broken bones, and the physician equalizes them until they join together well.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary that he places an ointment and a plaster if there is no hot abscess occurring.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place a pad on top according to the size of the place; and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the fracture is near the lower part, around the sole of the foot, then make something similar to a ball from cloth; and command the sick person to bend over it with his broken foot; then it should be bound with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let it be a bladder made from skin, within which there should be softness, so that the skin can be applied to the sole of the foot; and tie it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If, however, the fracture is on the outside, then it must be: that you place one bladder above and another beneath the foot; and keep your hand open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then put a splint, as the hand is rolled [into shape]; and extend it between the fingers with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If, however, there occurs a fracture in one of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, [the treatment] should be as appropriate.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then tie it with the sole [of the foot]; and if there is pain, place a straight, narrow bladder under it to lift the fracture and prevent movement.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If, however, the fracture is in the middle finger, index finger, thumb or ring finger, then it should be set and tied to the healthy finger that follows it; or all of them should be tied together according to their sequence; and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Or place a small bladder on top of it, as previously stated for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And consider in your restoration [technique], and after this arrangement of the setting [of the fracture], apply warm plasters; and oppose it as necessary when something happens from that, according to its narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 Chapter on the restoration of a hip fracture.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The head of the hip is frequently broken and exposed to sensation, because it turns towards the inner and posterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration is made in such a way that a bandage is tied above the fracture and another below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 The patient lies with his face upwards.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then extend all the bands of attachment to their respective parts equally; and this is done when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 If it is a fracture near the hip root, then let there be a ligament towards the pelvis part, so that the extension falls upward; and let there be another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly, if it is a fracture near the knee, then let there be a ligament near the knee so that the extension falls towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician reduces the bone with both his hands until he brings it back to its original shape; and joins the bone with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then, one should apply an ointment and a bandage if there is no abscess on the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess occurs there, then let it be for some days until the abscess settles down and becomes warm; then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 The bandage should be tied like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary to wrap a thick linen over the fracture, that is, a bandage; and fold it twice or thrice; and there should be an excess left from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the root of the thighbone (calcaneus at the root of the femur).
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee towards the lower parts; and let the ends of the thread come from the upper parts of both sides.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then wrap over the leg and the hip, using the excess linen from elsewhere.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place stars on the hip in the location of the fracture itself, and place one star on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the empty spaces between the leg and the hip with soft cloths, so that the bandage is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then start with a strong bandage from the middle over the location of the fracture with three or four windings.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you pull on the ligament away from the fracture site, let your bandage be smaller, softer, and looser.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then direct yourself to the two ends of the rod, which you have inserted between hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie together with three knots each of those that are above [them].
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go with the two ends of the rod to the lower parts, until you reach the ankle bone of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And tie together also the ends of the knots on the other side, so that the ligature does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then release the compression on that [area], as long as it remains, so that rot or gangrene, abscess, inflation, and similar things do not occur.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If something should happen from there.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Approach therefore with the resolution of that [issue], and correct whatever has happened there completely, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If on the other hand it is a splinter in the bone that pierces [the flesh]: then it is necessary that you equalize it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, puncture above it, and remove that [splinter]: and care for it with the remembrance of who came before [you], until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And sometimes this hip fracture is tied with these knots, apart from the addition of the knots, as we said in the help for the arm and leg.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, in restoring such a fracture, it does not happen that lame gait occurs in the weak [person].
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if only this is restored apart from applying another leg to it, then it is necessary that the weak one [person] always lame.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And know that the hip is tied for fifty days, or a little more or less: all of this depends on the diversity of complexions and other dispositions [of the body].
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 § On the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that the knee joint rarely suffers a fracture, but it often experiences repeated wear.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 If however it happens to suffer a fracture, then only either a crack or an opening in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And this is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 It stands firm upon it entirely with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 Its restoration is such that it becomes equal to what was disjointed from its parts with fingers, until it is bound and joined as much as possible according to the equality and ease, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then apply an ointment made from sesame flour or milled wheat with egg white, and place a round peg on top if needed; then bind it with a suitable strapping above.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions that we have mentioned in other fractures: such as warm abscess and similar conditions; thus you oppose every occurrence with what is suitable for it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 Chapter on the restoration of a broken limb.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that in the lower limb there are two bones, one is large and called the shin bone (Cruris), and the other is slender and called the calf bone (Focile).
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 It happens that both bones suffer the same types of fractures as two bones in the arm; and on account of this their restoration is similar to that of the arm, and the treatment is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If both bones break simultaneously, the lower limb becomes deformed in all its parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if the slender bone breaks, the lower limb bends forward.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 If the large bone breaks, you find it lower; and these are the ones that do not hide from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer extension, alignment, and pegging according to what is equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 It is necessary, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having many shards: that it should be less extended and with a gentler reduction by you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 In the operation of the leg there is something more than in the arm: and it is, that when you equalize the stars (constellations), and complete your entire operation, then take two bands from pine wood which are used in the making of solar panels that are placed under the boards: and they are made from the blades of a palm: and choose among them those with small thickness and neither from the very thin ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then fold over each cloth with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 Place one part of the leg on one side and the other part on the other side: and they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then bind the two bands in three places from both ends and in the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 Since ligature is forbidden, the leg sags to the right and left, and it stands with a good stance.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And now a cradle made of wood according to the length of the leg is to be administered and placed under it to keep it still.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 It is very important that you do this in a fracture when there is a wound properly (in the same place).
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the leg every day and study it with utmost care from swelling, or stretching, or any other conditions.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If something happens from these (conditions), then apply whatever is necessary to it until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the fracture of the bones in the feet and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter Eighteen.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 Fracture does not occur in the calcaneum (heel bone).
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 A fracture of the bones in the foot sometimes occurs, and a fracture of the fingers also happens seldomly; and it does not happen to them except through friction in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If a fracture of the bones in the foot occurs, and you see those bones rising above one another, then let the patient place his foot on the ground prepared as if he were walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then you stand there, and place your foot upon that which is raised from those bones; then press, or tread on it; and hold it even, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then apply the plaster and the wool on top of it; and place a small table under the belly of the foot, which has two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with a bandage suitable for binding, after you wrap it with linen cloths, and the other things that are required.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 Since three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find the bones evened out if they are broken, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 The operation is therefore performed as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If some fingers are broken, then restore them, and place them evenly as I told you in the treatment of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place the awl alongside your finger according to the length of the finger, and make it slightly wider; then place under the foot this table which I told you about, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If what is broken consists of two or three or more bones, then place the awl above every finger according to its size, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the table under the foot; and let it stand on one end of the table outside the belly of the foot, to hold it with a good hold.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 It is fitting for you not to forget, but to consider all that I have told you about the other fractures, concerning what we have said about accidents; and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 On the fracture of a woman's jaw, and the breastbone, and a man's long bone.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's jaw is fractured, then make her sit upright square-shaped (or in a chair with square corners).
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then tilt her towards the back of her own part a little, and she should be held backward.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then the midwife fills the woman's mouth with linen until it is full, and it should become like a sphere (or ball) in the woman's mouth.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then the woman is shaken, and her back is slightly raised.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 This linen exits until it becomes before the mouth of the woman like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a feather on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 When she wants to drink, let the linen be easily removed, then she drinks; and bring it back according to the way you inserted it first; then return to her feather first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Let this be done for seven days or approximately, because the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take the bladder of an egg, and tie a reed tube over its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her mouth.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder inflates inside the mouth, because the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then it is filled again with linen, and it remains for some days, as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 When the breastbone of a man or woman is fractured, then administer its restoration and the same method as we have said for the bone of Anchius (Ankle).
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And it is not hidden that the right [bone] is not concealed in nearby fractures, which occur little, especially for one who has some knowledge or skill.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 Understand my book much, because the fracture itself signifies to you in many dispositions a way straight in its restoration and its constriction; therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 When the penis of a man breaks, take the neck of a goose; and introduce the rod [into it].
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place upon him a covering from cloth, and let it be wrapped, and let it remain for three days or about these, and it will heal if God wishes.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 On the restoration of a fracture of bones, when it is with a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is fitting for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the thigh bone or arm bone, or similar to these, that you hasten and have the barber immediately; if they testify to you conditions of bloodletting, as we previously mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound exudes blood, then it is necessary that you hasten to its excision, so that pulverized ashes are sprinkled on it, if there is no other present.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to restore the fracture in him on that same day; and do not delay it, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If a warm abscess occurs, then let the restoration of it wait until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach him on the third and fourth day entirely, for you would cause evil accidents to happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the bone is protruding on the skin, detected; then it is necessary that you compress it and bring it back to its place with ease and little extension by your hands.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If however, the extension is not prepared, and its equalization with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And is an instrument that is made of iron, the length of which is the quantity of seven or eight fingers, and its width according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And on account of this, it is necessary for the physician to receive from them three or four according to the quantity that is needed for the cure of any type of fracture in every case.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And let it be round: and let its thickness be small, so that it does not become doubled when pressed upon it during the hour of surgery: and let it have sharp edges, to which a margin should be on its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And let it be broader at its top from the middle to the bottom.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 In this operation, its sharp end should be curved over the protruding bone's extremity, and it should be pushed with one blow until when the bone returns and is equalized by some equilibrium.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Strive therefore to equalize the fracture extremities on both sides.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the fracture's extremity is delicate and does not receive the instrument well, then it is necessary to cut the bone's extremity until the instrument can grip it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 But if you cannot reduce them with it as we have said completely, then cut it with the chisels that I mentioned, or saw it with one saw however it is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then grind what remains of the bone from its roughness and small cortices.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 When the bone is reduced and after its reduction it finds a weak spot causing strong pain, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
Fac ergo illud.	 Make that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 You confer a great remedy upon the sick one, when you complete the restoration which you make of bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then immerse the cloth in wine of cedar, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place on the wound greenish matter nor anything containing oil; so that corruption and decay does not occur in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer astilas at the hour of completion of your restoration of bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And release the wound that has been cauterized; thus, so that you cut a hole with forceps according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And be careful not to bind the wound when breaking it (fracture).
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For this has often been done by foolish physicians; and they have caused death to occur over their patients or corruption or gangrene, that is, pus.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And let your ligature be soft, gentle and diverse from the ligatures of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or large and you fear some evil accidents that we have mentioned, and find pain in the suspended place; then it is not necessary for you to place astilas on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make incisions from hard cloths at the place of astilas and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 And when it is one day or two days and you see that a wound has begun to generate pus; then remove the cloth that you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer linen and ointments according to our custom, in order to heal wounds; such as four-spice ointment (tetrapharmakon) and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 It is suitable for you to loosen the ligature.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 Pay attention to the wound every day at morning and evening until it heals and recovers.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 It is necessary that the limb should be prepared in such a way that the pus runs out from it easily towards the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If many days pass by without the wound healing and the pus is not discharged from it, then you will know that there are small pieces of bone in that place.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, you should examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 How many of those small pieces of bone are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those that are not separated and pierce the limb and cause pain, try to cut them off and remove them in any way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If a splinter or foreign body occurs in the wound, such as an insect or other corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to use for each one of them what is suitable for its cure, which was mentioned in its own chapter in the previous narrative.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And in the matter where my speech must continue and when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as the hip or scapula, or similar large bones, it is not to be presumed that you can attract it back many times, for often death occurs from this; rather leave it alone until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then care for the wound if it seems to you; and if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 Chapter on the Treatment of the Swelling in a Fracture.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 This swelling often occurs during the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Especially those that are near joints, and become disfigured from it in the shape of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Consider then if the bandage is recent: administer in it medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and helebore, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Therefore, take some of these or all of them: and boil them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them over the bandage on a cloth, and press them well over the wound.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And let the bandage be, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then unbind it, and bind another until the inflammation disappears.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or press a sheet of lead well over it.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing everything that fears from members.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the inflammation has already turned into stone, and it is tightly bound, and there is a pressing necessity to remove it: then, on its upper part, apply a poultice and cut off the excess that protrudes: or scrape it with some scrapers until it disappears; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 Chapter on treatment when the member remains weak after that, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture is restored and the limb remaining after that is subtle and weak: then it is not done except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of the reasons is that the multiplicity of the solution and its ligature is not done as required, or due to excessive tightening of the ligaments before it is prohibited for nutrients to reach the limb, or due to an excess of embrocation at an inappropriate time, or due to a lack of blood in the weakened body.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 And its treatment is to feed the weak and make his body tender until blood multiplies within it.
Et administra balneum.	 And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And pour joy and happiness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the limb: so that it attracts a large amount of nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 And continuously apply embrocation to it with warm water until the nourishment heals and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 Chapter on the treatment of bone fractures when they are restored twisted.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 If a twist or hump occurs in the restored limb after its healing, and an outgrowth of the fractured bone, or a nodule: and it disfigures the limb's shape, but the limb does not prohibit its natural operation; then you should not heed the words of him who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done this on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 And indeed, this operation is to be severely criticized, leading to death or a great fear that it may result in death.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 However, if the limp and nodule are recent: then it is necessary to apply embrocation with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves of althea, and its root, and melilotus, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And let it [the plaster] be made like a well-made plaster, such as dachelon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Take the mucilage of the marshmallow root and grind it with chicken fat or sesame oil; and apply [it as a plaster].
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Take figs (the fat ones), grind them with pigeon-dung powder and similar substances which are named as those that reduce consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes a knot is loosened by persistent, ancient, and gentle rubbing, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 Move the limb to every part in all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If, however, a tortuous condition has already occurred, and it has become strong, and has turned into a stone, and the necessity for treatment with iron has arisen; then, when cutting is necessary, the superior part of it should be cut, and the continuity of the bone should be loosened, and whatever superfluous remains from the knot or bone should be cut away with fine instruments; and ease should be administered in this case with diligence and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 Chapter on Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the departure of one joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it should be forbidden to move and it becomes deformed in appearance.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes accidents and severe pain to occur above the weak [part].
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 When there is a dislocation, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration; it should not be delayed in any way.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if it is delayed, the location becomes fixed, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore, it should not be moved or extended in the hour of its fixation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because it often causes a spasm and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 But when that happens, then it is necessary to hurry to the bloodletting of the weak [person].
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it should be allowed to rest until the abscess subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then the affected limb should be anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then it should be moved gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And all the limbs must be treated where the memory of it returns to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I myself have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, even according to what has been done previously for fractures, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 Chapter on the treatment of a dislocated lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 Rarely do both lower jaws get dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Removals from their places, even small ones, soften somewhat.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 If dislocations occur completely, they should be reduced gradually until they soften to the chest part, until the salt solution heals the sickness, and it cannot hold it or close its own mouth, and the tongue is wrapped with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When a small dislocation occurs, then it returns itself into several positions with a little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If the dislocation is complete and entire: then it should be reduced quickly, without delaying too much; and there must be someone to hold the head of the sick person; and the doctor should insert his thumb into one of the roots of the Mandible dislocation if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or insert two thumbs at once, if the dislocation is on both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And let the other fingers of his hands be outside, which are equal [to their task].
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And order the sick person to clean his Mandibles and purify them for eating all over.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The doctor presses the Mandible, and forces it back into its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction is difficult, especially if both Mandibles are at the same time: then administer vaporization with hot water and oil until it becomes easy to reduce both; do not delay the reduction of both in any case, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they return and align, and the sick person's mouth is closed, and they do not soften: then place small pillows of cloth over them, with a mixture made from wax, called ceroto; and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it should be tied loosely with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 The sick person should sleep on his back; and his head should be kept still between two small pillows, so that he does not move to the right and left; nor should he try or be forced to chew something; rather, his food should be given through a gentle syringe, until the pain subsides, and the Mandible is tied; then he can eat whatever he wants, and it should be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 The patient should not eat or drink at his mouth operation, nor speak, until the mandible heals and is cured.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of the two mandibles becomes difficult when they are dislocated at any time and do not return to their place, it often happens that fevers occur, and there is continuous vomiting. The weak stomach may dissolve and perhaps it vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 If you see that (the mandibles do not return to their place), then know that it is a loss, and the person who experiences this often dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Section on the reduction of dislocation of the collarbone and the end of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The collarbone is not dislocated from within on the side due to its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 It is sometimes dislocated towards the outside, which can be detected by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 The restoration of it (the collarbone) is that the weak person lies on his back and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then you put your hands in its place with a strong crook, because it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then apply a plaster and poultices, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 The ends of the humerus that follow the elbow joint are connected to it, they do not dislocate except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it (the humerus) is dislocated on any day: then it must be reduced and adjusted according to what we have said, and what you will prepare for yourself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then apply a plaster and poultices, and binding material.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And order the sick person to observe tranquility and rest until it is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 With this same treatment, the end of the humerus is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Section on the reduction of the dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the arm (humerus) is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One of them is that it dislocates towards the part of the deltoid muscle downwards.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second is that it dislocates towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the Humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 And it is not dislocated towards the back (part), because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it is not dislocated towards the front (part), because of nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 And indeed it is often dislocated and emerges towards the lower part, turned backward (in the direction of) the elbow; particularly in those whose flesh is scanty.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because it emerges quickly in them and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is contrary to this, namely because it emerges with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps it happens to some men that they are struck or have an accident, and the Humerus is separated by a separator heated, and it is believed because of this, since it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, one must try that out until you are certain of its (the condition's) nature, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 The dislocation is recognized when it is towards the lower part, turned backward (in the direction of) the elbow: and distinguish between a dislocated Humerus and a healthy Humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you find among them (the dislocated and healthy Humeri) a clear difference, and in the head of the Humerus you find a hollow, and below the elbow at the touched head of the Humerus it feels like an egg: and the weak cannot bring back the hand to its own ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then you find a clear touch (mark) that is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And this kind of dislocation has an easy reduction when it is recent or the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 The reduction (of the dislocated Humerus) is to raise the hand towards the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then put your thumbs below the elbow and raise the joint with force to its place: and the hand should be raised and extended towards the upper part.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then place her below, for he quickly returns.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 If he does not return as we have said, and from the beginning it is dislocation, then the sick person should be bathed in warm water, and embrocation that softens and soothes should be administered, such as if they decook roots of althea, fenugreek, and melilotus in water, and it should be administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then the sick person shall lie on his back: and place a sphere under his affected area and wool, which should be equal in softening and tightening.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the physician shall place his heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the arm with force, and draw the hand of the sick person downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another servant shall hold the head of the sick person, so that it is not moved downwards; for he quickly returns.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, bring him back in this way: and there is, that you make the present man who is taller than the sick person, to stand by his side, and insert his arm under the affected area of the sick person; and lift the affected area upwards, until the sick person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another servant shall pull the hand of the sick person towards the lower part of his stomach.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the sick person is lightweight: then it is necessary that he be suspended with something else to make him heavier; for dislocation quickly returns.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And it is also brought back in another way: and there is, that a wooden beam is shaped on the ground with its head round like a mitten of a miller; neither too thick nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then place a soft cloth beneath the sick person after the heads are placed on the wooden beam; and let the sick person stand along the length of the beam.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then extend his hand towards the lower part from one side, and extend his body from the other side with force; for the joint will return to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If the reduction is difficult using all that has been said, then use this remedy: and it is to take a piece of wood whose length is twice the size of an arm, and its width four fingers, and its thickness two fingers: whose end should be rounded, so that it may be inserted deeply, following this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then cover the rounded end with soft cloth, so as not to hurt the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then place it under the weak spot (of the patient), so that the hand or arm can be extended over the wood to its lower parts, and tie the wood to the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then place the arm on a step of a ladder at its width and extend the hand to below, and leave the rest of the body suspended from another side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For union (of fractured bones) enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 Therefore, when the opening is completed as much as possible: then it is necessary to place under the weak spot (of the patient) a sphere equal in size to it, made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place a prepared plaster made from milled powder with olibanum and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it is rolled on top of it.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then bind under the weak spot a bandage of suitable size, and roll the thread over the plaster above it; and connect the hand to the neck of the same person, and do not move the hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 It is necessary to provide a small amount of food until the limb recovers strength, because it heals more quickly in this way.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then, after seven or five days, a larger one should be placed and it should be removed with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If it is tightened and does not become soft, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If the union is dislocated many times due to moisture that happens to it or for some other reason: then it is necessary to administer cautery with three holes, according to what has been said in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If this whole procedure is carried out and the ligament is dissolved after seven days and the joint is not joined again, and the plaster and the bandage are not held together, and it falls and cannot be lifted to the upper part: then you will know that the nerves that are towards the head of the humerus have already been cut or stretched or softened; and you will know that the joint will never heal in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 For dislocation that occurs towards the chest and breast or towards the back and is reduced, it is done by pushing and stretching with hands until it returns to its place, then bandaging and caring for it remains until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If pain occurs after healing of a limb and slowness in its movement, then the sick person should use baths many times until the pain is relieved, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Chapter on the treatment of shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 You should know that the shoulder joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, but especially towards the front or towards the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And its dislocation will not be hidden from you: because it falls under sight and touch, according to whatever shape it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join the dislocated shoulder with a sound one, its displacement becomes clear to you manifestly.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 The joint will be hollowed out and the arm cannot double nor touch its own humerus.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 It is necessary that you hurry and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if a hot abscess occurs to it, the reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 It is indeed worse than all kinds of dislocations, and it causes a more violent pain; and death often accompanies it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the restoration of it, when possible, is to extend the hand with both hands; and the arm should be expanded, and the hands of the physician should be above the elbow and below it; and he himself pushes the joint with the tips of his fingers or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns like this, that he separates his hand with the other hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not obey to restoration, then administer a strong and vigorous extension; it is as if two servants extend the arm; and they should also hold him so that he is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then turn the arm in every direction after it has slipped over his hand, a cloth doubled long or a broad bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he binds it with oil; so that it is one of those things that help in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then push the joint with a strong thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After its restoration, it is necessary to place on it a plaster with styptic properties and extracting action with albumen of egg; and it should be tied with a bandage of suitable width.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 The arm is hung from the neck of the patient; let it stay for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then it is loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If the joint has been fixed in its place, then unbind it and let it be.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 If you see that the joint is not bound well, then apply another plaster, and bind it again; let it be for some days until it becomes fixed.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then dissolve it (the wound or suture).
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If it happens that there is swelling after the reduction of the joint (dislocation), and its arrangement is mobile: then administer moistening in bathing, gentle friction, and compression until it settles down, or place upon the joint, that is, the greasy lamb's wool.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then tie it (the limb), and leave it on it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it, and immerse it in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When it sweats (the limb), then gently friction the joint.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then apply to it (the limb) alum three times, at each bath entry, until it softens.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you want, place on it (the limb) cow dung, moistened and heated with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 It itself becomes soft and returns to its normal position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 Chapter on the cure of a dislocation by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 The hand of Almahassem is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 The reduction (repositioning) of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 On the contrary, other joints are more difficult to deal with.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, speed is necessary in the reduction of this dislocation within the hour it occurs before it is dislocated again; otherwise a warm abscess may occur there.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 The reduction of the dislocation in this case is such that Almahassem places his weak hand on a table, and stretches out its minister (assistant); and the physician puts his palm over the prominent joint, and pushes it until it returns to its normal position.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, it should be considered that if the palm has already withdrawn to the back of the hand: then the weak patient places his back on the table for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be facing downwards on the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table so that the physician can fall upon the prominent joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it therefore returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then tie it with a plaster while the abscess is sitting: and leave it alone, do not return to it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 If it cannot tolerate [the reduction], nor can you make another attempt on it after the days have passed, but nevertheless the connection remains according to its twisting: and nothing hurts the weak except what softens the hand, and it cannot tie anything: then you will know that the nerves have been severed or rubbed off.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 Therefore, there is no skill in it except to tie it with a cautionery near its failure.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps it does not contribute anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 Since Almahassem did not return, then place upon him a plaster as I have said.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then it is to be tied and left for five days: afterwards it is to be loosened and left, and the hand is to be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If movement is deprived from it and something of heaviness happens to it in it: then soften it with warm water and rubbing several times, until it becomes softened.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Chapter on the treatment of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated from any part of it or the finger is dislocated to the back of the palm or its joint: then stretch out the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then hold the head of the finger and suspend it turned towards the side to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then suspend it and stretch it out until it becomes straight on that day itself.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When it is night, tie it as stated before: and do not cease to untie it during the day: and exercise it with movement: and tie it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Let it be for some days until it is sutured.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And similarly do with it if the hand is displaced to the abdomen: and bind it to that part, and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And likewise do with it when it is displaced to other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 Chapter on the treatment of a dislocation of the spine.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When a person has a dislocation of the spine, either complete of the neck, or many spondyles are displaced from their places: then there is no cure in it, for death approaches the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And the sign of this is that the hunger of the sick departs without will, nor can it be held; and many times some members of his are softened from it, or two legs of himself, or two arms, or one of them; or a spondyle is displaced from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For many times it is displaced, which is often displacement to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 That which is displaced towards the backside is called hunchback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 The treatment of this is to consider it then, if the hunchback occurs from childhood; there is no cure in it, nor is healing altogether from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 In the case where it occurs due to an accident, or blow, or similar things, the ancients have already said modes of treatment in a long speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 Of this, many do not return with improvement.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 I myself have already shortened from that one who excuses little of much due to my proximity to his intention; and in my explanation which I explained it, and formed the instrument of it differently than they showed it, and explained it themselves.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, I say that in hunchback which occurs from the front part, there is no remedy, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly in this one which occurs to both sides too.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not treated from those, unless the one which occurs to the back properly, with what I mentioned earlier; and it is, that the sick one should be extended on his face upon an equal platform almost to a wall; and something wet cloth is spread under him so as not to hurt his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then place a straight stick fixed in the fire on the ground at the end of the foot, around its head; and another stick about its feet at the end of the other foot; and let a servant hold the stick, and it not be fastened in the fire.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And let another servant hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then cover the head of the sick one and around his eyelashes tie a soft binding firmly; and extend the end of the binding to the stick that is at his head and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then bind another binding above the ankles of his feet, and above his knees, and at the insteps.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the bindings together and tie them to the other stick that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then let every servant extend the binding to a part of the stick and neither move the sticks from their places where they are fixed; but they should not be fastened as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the physician shall place his hands on the shinbone with force until it returns; or he shall place a board upon it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he attaches his feet to the board until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If it does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And hollow out a hole in the wall that I mentioned next to the sick one, into which the end of the board enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle of the board on the shinbone.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And let the physician place his feet upon the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And tie it well until the shinbone is bent, and it returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then if you wish, work with the lathe that turns with your hand; and it is so that you shape on the ground at the head of the sick one two sticks, whose length is an arm each; and at his head at the other foot two more sticks.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And let the length be that which is between every stick of wood, one palm's breadth: and now a hole has been made in every place, through which runs the tourniquet; and let every stick be firmly fixed on the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And a round stick is inserted: and the tourniquet has a rope that rotates in the holes of two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at the end of it is a hole, into which a stick is fixed, whose length is one palm with what rotates; and similarly on two other sticks there are as well.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then tie the cords which you tied in the chest of the sick man to the tourniquet that is near his head; and tie the cords which you tied in his legs to the tourniquet that is near his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then let the servant stand by each tourniquet and turn his hand with a cloth, with which the tourniquet is turned; and the surgeon sets the splint, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of the tourniquet that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then, when the splint is set and the place has healed, it is necessary to apply dry plaster with the egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then, plaster.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Then place on top of the plaster a star-shaped patch from wood, whose width is three fingers, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length should be enough to cover the swelling and the healthy part of the splint.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it is tied with the cord that I said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And let the sick man be nourished with subtle food until he has recovered.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If there remains some swelling at the end of healing, it is necessary to administer medications that soften and soothe with the administration of the tablets that I have mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now, the plate of lead is applied to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 When there occurs a prominence in the last vertebra of the back: and it is believed that it is due to dislocation, and it is the bone that now projects.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, one should not make an assumption about him with this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the joints of the ankle and the joints of the shoulder do not occur except by dislocation; nor does it happen to them what happens to other joints due to slight displacement and hollowing out.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 Indeed, the ankle joint is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 Because it is dislocated towards the front and towards the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 Mostly it is dislocated towards the inside; but rarely towards the front and towards the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 The treatment for dislocation towards the inside is as follows: because when you join the weak leg with a healthy one, it is longer; and the knee of the weak person protrudes more than that of a healthy one, and the weak person cannot double his foot at the knee; and there is a place that follows the inner knee, which is pressed by the pressure of a hot poultice, because the head of the hip has already reached this place.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 The sign for one who experiences dislocation towards the outside is that his symptoms are opposite to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 The sign for one who experiences dislocation towards the front is that he stretches out a healthy leg to its full length; however, without pain in the knee, he cannot double it; and if he tries to walk on it, he cannot do so over it towards the front; and his urine retains, his inner knee is pressed, and during walking his heel is beaten upon the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of the one who suffers dislocation at the back is that he does not extend his knee nor can double it before doubling his thigh; and his leg is also shorter on the other side; and his thigh is softened, and the head of the hip is at its place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction of this dislocation's species is that one should consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already become fixed with it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then, if you administer the reduction of this [dislocation] and it remains according to its own position; then there is no treatment at all in that case.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, a presumption should not be made about him deeply.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In the one whose dislocation is recent and belongs to one of four species of dislocations; then hasten to this, so that you want to join it, and extend it towards the interior and exterior, and move it right and left; forcibly it may return, and no other care is needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If this does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong helper and to extend his leg from the lower part; either with hands or with a ligament that is tied above his knee; and another helper extends his hand above, so that he introduces his hands under the patient's fingertips.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then tie a soft ligament over the root of the hip, and hold the end of another ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And let its extension be either from the front of the thigh to the neck of the shoulder, or from the back to the middle of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And let its extension be uniform for all [parts], until the weak one is lifted with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 For this is the common species of extension for the four species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If the dislocation returns with what was said, it is good; and if not, then necessary for every species is what I will say about its own treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the reduction [of a fracture], when the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the sick one lies on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then place a bandage over the root of the hip, where it is between the head of the hip and the area under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to a higher part of the body, to the chest or neck area.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then let another strong man take hold of his arm, and cut away the swollen area of the weak hip, and stretch it out with a forceful extension towards the outside.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now, it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this method is easier than the other methods of treatment, by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If, however, the patient is pushed back and does not obey you when this method of treatment is applied to him completely: then it is necessary that two weak feet be bound together with a strong bandage, gently, on their heels and knees; and let the length of each be four finger-widths from its own comparison; and let the weak leg be stretched out more than the other by twice the length of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then the sick one is suspended over the head of a wooden post, which should be in the house; and let the length from the ground be two forearms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to bind the head of the hip; and suspend another boy with the sick one; and let a third youth push him, binding the hip firmly, for the joining will return to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 When it is a reduction towards the outside and the dislocation is there, it is necessary that the sick one lies on a bed or chair with a hump, as we have said before.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And bind the bandage over his weak leg and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two wooden posts are placed, one at his feet, and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then place a stick in the middle of the foot, fixed well: on which should be wrapped wet cloths, so as not to harm the weak: and let the stick be between his thighs, so that he is not drawn downwards during stretching.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then let every assistant go to their part, and the doctor shall equally stretch with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If it obeys in reversing, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place it on the table, and press it equally, as we said in the swelling, just as we have described before.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, the weak one must lie on the healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it should be stretched quickly: and this is according to the same story on the foot: and the doctor shall place his right palm over the weak hip.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then bend him with the other hand, and with that bending, place him stretched to the lower parts towards the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 If the dislocation is towards the back: then it is not necessary to stretch the weak one downwards and raise him above the ground: but it is necessary that he lies on a hard object, as it is also necessary if his ankle is dislocated towards the outside, according to what we said about his lying over two ankles: and it is on his face, and his limbs are extended: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also on the place where the joint departs, when the reduction is completed according to what is required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you stretch out two legs of the weak: and when you see them equal, and the weak one tightens his leg, and expands himself without being distracted: then you know that the limb has returned, according to what is required: then join the thighs, and apply a plaster, and bind it with linen, that is, a roller: in this way, so that the ankle does not move towards any part: and let the weak one rest quietly for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then unfasten the ligament, and apply the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: if you see that they are equal in position, then you shall know that the dislocation is already fixed: therefore release the weak to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see something softening: then return, and apply the plaster again, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then unfasten it and make it slow in walking on both sides for some days until it recovers well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 Chapter On Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated towards the outside, towards the inside, and towards the lower part, namely the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated towards the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 And a sign of its dislocation is that you shall order the weak to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 But if it does not stick to the hip: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all the ways of its dislocation is that you shall make the weak sit straight, so that he now extends his leg if he can over it and his back touches his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then make the knee of his join with your palms, and straighten them across his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply two sides of his knee with the palm of your hand with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another servant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 And a sign of returning is that the leg sticks with the hip gently, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then plaster it and make the leg stick to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind these with a bandage for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then unbind (or cut) it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And let the sick person not walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If he refuses to be drawn back (reduced), then administer a strong traction with straps, as has been previously mentioned in the treatment of hernia, until he returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 Chapter on the treatment of dislocated heel bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel bone is sometimes displaced by a small movement, and sometimes it is completely dislocated.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 Its dislocation can be towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, protruding to the side towards which it has been dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 Its removal (reduction) is easy: it should be drawn back gently with the hands until it returns to its place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 When it is completely dislocated, in its treatment, one should make the sick person sit upright; and a strong man should hold him firmly from behind the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold with your right hand the foot from its upper part, and with your left hand at the lower part of the foot where the shin is.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Then, grasp it twice with the left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then stretch it with the left and push the sole of the foot forward with the right without strain.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do this twice as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the sole of the foot forward to the leg for a third time, and you pull the shin (shinbone).
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If it returns to its place once or twice as you do this, and you see the foot is even, it is good; but if not, repeat the procedure on it, because it will return again.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If the reduction is forbidden to you with that which we have said: then make it lie weak on its back on the ground, and set a firm pillow in the ground, so that it falls between its hips; and now you have rolled a cloth over it, so that it does not injure the weak one.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then take hold of the hip of the patient; afterwards, let another person stretch the foot, either with his hands or with a rope that ties around the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then let every servant stretch as far as his strength allows; and a pillow should be standing between the hips of the weak person, holding it so that the body is not drawn towards the lower part during the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor equalizes the dislocation with his hands, and another servant holds the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 For dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When the dislocation returns and you are informed that it has returned to its place, then apply ointment and plaster, bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot with a rope to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 It is necessary to be careful or afraid of the nerves that are above the heel bone at the back, so that a tight bandage is not placed over them and they are injured.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then let him go for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the bandage becomes soft, tighten it again; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and forbid the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 But if he tries to walk before that period, there will not be security unless it is loosened over him again and dislocation occurs, and it will not receive treatment afterward.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If a hot abscess happens to him: then it is necessary to administer to its sedation that which was previously mentioned in another place about its treatment, and embrocation until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Chapter on Dislocation of the Fingers of the Foot and Treatment.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that what is dislocated from them with slight extension without labor should be put in its place; and indeed it is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 If the dislocation is in some swellings on the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the sick person make his foot sit on an equal place on the ground or table; and he stands thus like one walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand, and put your foot on that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press it with your foot with force until it returns and you see that it is in place and no longer projects out in the location.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then put a board under the belly of his foot which can hold the entire foot with two openings.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then tighten it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then loosen it and make him rest from walking for many days until it is tightened and secured by reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 On the types of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 Whenever something of this kind happens, and you attempt its treatment and restoration, death often occurs many times; therefore, it is not appropriate to presume upon such a cure unless the person is wise in the long-standing art, compassionate, devout, patient, not bold, nor presumptuous: and that he should use medicines in the beginning which quell cold ulcers only: and let him leave the sick one to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you see or hope for health from destruction with leniency of illness, and where something appears to offer hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore, make the reduction of it immediately at the beginning, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If the limb then returns as we wish, then administer a regime that quells the abscess: and treat the wound with it which is appropriate to it from the most drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If the dislocation is with a fracture, and separated sores occur on the bone, then attempt their excision, and make in that which I said for simple diseases in the places of those sores.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be careful according to your strength and keep yourself from entering the path of fear; as my previous words have predicted for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more healthy for your body among them in your time.
