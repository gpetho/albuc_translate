[2] []
Since the practice of manual surgery has fallen in our region, and in our time has been almost entirely lost, until perhaps the knowledge of it perished, and its traces were cut off. Only small descriptions of it remain in the books of the ancients, altered by other hands, where errors and confusion have arisen, until its purposes became closed off and its efficacy weakened. It seemed to me fitting to bring it back to life with the organization of this Treatise, following the way of exposition, clarification, and abbreviation, and to include the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the practice, with explanations added and with the necessary urgency.

[] [1]
For the skilled practitioner of operative surgery is totally lacking in our land and time; so that the knowledge of it is on the point of being blotted out and its remains lost; and there is nothing left of it except a few traces in the books of the Ancients; where, however, it has been so corrupted by the hands of scribes, and subjected to error and confusion, that its meaning has become obscured and its value diminished.

[] [2]
Therefore I decided to revive this art by expounding, elucidating, and epitomizing it in this treatise; and to present the forms of the cauterizing irons and other operative instruments, since this is an adjunct to explanation and a vital necessity.

[29] []
On cauterization with fire, and cauterization with sharp medicines, arranged chapter by chapter, and organized from head to foot, with the forms of instruments and cautery tools, and everything necessary for practice. ¶

[] [31]
Concerning the actual cautery; and cauterization by caustics.

It is divided into chapters set in order from the head to the feet.

The shapes of the instruments are shown and the iron cauteries and all things necessary for operating.

On the method of cauterizing the head in cases of pain throughout the entire head.

[2] []
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head and persists in the patient, and he uses syrups, oils, head purgatives, and ointments.

[3] []
And especially if it has already been cauterized with the cautery we have described, and none of these treatments help him, then consider the following.

[4] []
For if the head of the patient is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly below that spot.

[5] []
Then cauterize on each side of his head with a cautery, until it passes through the skin and exposes the amount of bone we have mentioned.

[6] []
And cauterize him with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place called "vas," where the cup is applied; lift your hand in this, and do not expose the bone.

[7] []
For the patient will feel intense pain from this, unlike the pain from the other head cauteries.

[] [1]
On cauterization of the head (continued).

[] [2]
 When the whole head is affected by chronic headache which has for long vexed the patient, and electuaries, laxatives, errhines, oils, and plasters have been applied; and particularly if he has undergone the single cauterization which we have described, all with no effect, then look well, and if his head is naturally strong of structure and is not weak, and if he feels a vehement frigidity, cauterize him over again a little above the first cautery; then cauterize him on each frontal prominence with one cautery so as to remove the thickness of the skin and expose as much of the bone as we have mentioned above; and burn him with one stroke on the hinder part of the head in the place known as the occiput; but in this cauterization be gentle and do not lay bare the bone; for thus the patient would have intense pain, different from that of other head cauterizations.

When cold and excessive humors occur in the stomach, to the extent that they disrupt its temperament, and phlegm increases, and regular treatments are ineffective, then the patient should be placed on his back, with his legs and arms extended.

[3] []
Then cauterize with three cauteries: one under the breastbone the size of a single finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on both sides of this cautery, until a triangular shape is formed by the cauteries.

[4] []
And leave space between each so that they do not merge when they form pus.

[] [2]
 When cold and many humidities get into the stomach, so that its constitution is disturbed and much fluxion has come to it, and a variety of treatment has been tried to no effect, the patient must be put on his back with legs and arms outstretched; then give him a threefold cauterization: one a finger's breadth below the hollow of the chest with the claviform cautery; and two below and to the sides of the first cauterization, so that it has a triangular appearance; but there should be some distance between each lest they run together when suppuration sets in.

Take a long, dry root of aristolochia, selecting the longest available, approximately the thickness of a finger.

Then immerse it in oil and ignite it in fire.

[5] []
Then apply one cautery at the point where the furcula meets the neck, and two smaller cauteries slightly downward below the chin.

[] [2]
 The Ancients mentioned a cauterization for cold pleurisy by means of the roots of the long birthwort, in this fashion: you take the longest you can find of the roots of the long dry birthwort, and of the thickness of one finger; dip this in oil and light it at the fire; then burn the patient with one cauterization in the space between the junction of the neck with the clavicle; and two small cauterizations below the jugular veins, inclining slightly toward the region below the beard.

However, if leprosy has spread over the patient and is clearly visible, then apply the cauteries as we described on the head, one on the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, a large one on the sacrum at the base of the spine, one just above it, two on the hips (one on each hip), two on the knees (one on each knee), two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the softer parts of the chest; cauterize every joint, including the joints of the fingers of both hands and feet; also cauterize on every heel and the backs of the hands.

[] [6]
If the elephantiasis be widespread over the patient and appears obvious, you should give him, as well as the cauterizations described for the head: one at the end of the nose; two over the cheek bones; two over the cervical vertebrae; six over the dorsal vertebrae; a great one over the coccyx by the last vertebra of the tail; another above that on the flat of the back; two over the hip joints, one on either hip; two on the knees, one on either knee; two over the shoulders; two on the elbows; and two on the upper part of the breast; and burn him once on each joint of his fingers and toes, and on each ankle and on each forearm.

Then take the spatula that I have previously described.

[8] []
Then peel back the skin gently with it until you reach the artery.

[9] []
Next, insert a hook into it and pull it upwards, lifting it out of the skin, and free it from the membranes surrounding it on all sides.

[] [4]
But if it is not plain to you then let the patient bind his neck with the end of his garment; then do you rub the place with a piece of cloth or foment with hot water, till the artery is obvious to you; then take a scalpel shaped thus; then with it gently scrape away the skin till you come to the artery, then stick a hook in it and draw it upward till you extract it from the skin and free it all round from the membranes that are beneath it.

[] [15]
Bring it down, very hot, till it reaches the bone and the artery is cut in two places, so as to put some distance between the two ends, for it will certainly not unite after this cauterization.

[] [17]
It is a wide ring of iron, of such a size as to go into the mouth above the tongue.

It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, and the mouth stays open without the patient's volition; nor can he dislodge it at all until you turn it.

The accidental type, however, has two forms: one of which is similar to fatty nodes.

[6] []
The other form is similar to an abscess that arises from the swelling of an artery.

[7] []
And in it there is danger, and one should not presume to treat it with a knife, unless it is small: and you should test it, and investigate it with a probe.

[8] []
If you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any veins, then cut it as nodes are cut: and remove it with whatever it contains from a cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then inspect it fully.

[9] []
Then treat the area with what is required for healing, until it is cured.

[] [5]
The acquired is of two kinds: one resembles a sebaceous cyst, the other resembles the tumour arising from an arterial aneurysm, and it is dangerous to incise it, so on no account must you apply a knife to the latter kind, except any that are small; if you try and explore them with a probe and you find they are like sebaceous cysts and not adherent to any blood-vessel, then immediately cut down upon them as you would a cyst and remove them with whatever capsule may surround them, if they are contained within a capsule; and if not, dissect away the whole accurately; then treat the place with suitable remedies.

If the cause is a fissure in the membrane with a protruding mass, the abscess’s color resembles that of the surrounding skin. It is soft, painless, and appears in different locations.

[7] []
If the cause is the protrusion of the intestine, it will display a more pronounced difference, as previously described.

[8] []
When you press it with your fingers, it recedes but then reappears and might make a sound. It becomes more pronounced in the bath or with intense activity.

[] [3]
If it be due to ruptured peritoneum and protruding omentum, the colour of the tumour will be the same as the rest of the body; it will be soft and painless and will seem to change its position; But if it be due to an escape of bowel the change of position, compared with what we have described, will be greater, and it will disappear on digital pressure, and then will recur; and often there will be crepitus with it, and it will increase in size on entering the bath or on violent exertion.

Then take a needle, in which there is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads: and insert it at the base of the membrane, that is, the tunic which is under the skin of the testicles that follows the incision: then cut the ends that extend from the thread, until there are four threads.

[21] []
Then arrange some of them over others in a shape like a cross: and tie the membrane, of which we spoke, that is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can send anything to them, so that a warm swelling does not occur from there.

[22] []
And again place a second ligature outside the first ligature, two fingers away from it.

[23] []
And after these two ligatures, leave a portion of the membrane under the skin of the testicles, the size of a finger’s breadth, and cut the rest completely around, and remove the egg from it.

_When the fetus emerges on its knees and hands_

[30] []
When the fetus emerges in this way, she must carefully insert her hands gradually.

[31] []
Then the woman should be laid back on her neck, with her legs hanging down, lying on the bed with her hands folded.

[32] []
Then gently press on her abdomen.

[33] []
Then remove what is beneath her feet from the cushions, so that she is prepared at the lower part.

[34] []
If the fetus does not emerge, take its feet and shake them with firm motion.

Next, press gradually above the lower abdomen until the fetus moves upward.

Then insert her hands, gradually aligning the fetus, and instruct the woman to bear down until the fetus emerges.

_When the fetus is hanging laterally by its arms_

[] [25]
 Presentation of the foetus by knees and hands : when it comes out after this manner you should seek to introduce the hands slowly; then let the woman lie back on her shoulders with her feet hanging down, reclining on a couch with her hands clasped together; then very gently put pressure upon the abdomen; then take away the pillows from under her feet until her lower parts are vertical ; and if the foetus does not come out then, take both her feet and shake them violently ; then press upon her costal margin until the foetus ascends ; then let the midwife insert her hand and put the foetus in the right position, very gently, and bid the woman bear down, until the infant is born.

One of these causes is either the body's lack of blood, or its malignancy; or because there is hard flesh between it and above its edges, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there is much filth and foulness; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the substance discharged into it is of poor quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its healing; or because a type of pestilence has fallen upon the area; or due to a regional property, as occurs in Zaragoza, where the digestion of ailments is difficult, and the healing of swellings is delayed by nature; or because there is a bone or several bones in it.

[] [6]
One is lack, or poorness, of blood in the body; or it may be because the hardness of the tissues, internally and at the edges of the opening, prevents the growth of sound tissue; or it may be because of the abundance of foul and evil matter; or it may be because the ulcer is necrotic in itself and the matter that it discharges is of bad quality; as also it may be because the remedy used in treating it is not suitable; or again it may be because of corruption arising at that locality, of the nature of pestilence; or it may be due to something special and peculiar in the locality—as happens in the city of Saragossa, where diseases tend to linger and tumours are naturally slow to heal; or it may be due to one or more bones in it.

When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the duration of the abscess extends until it collects pus: then it bursts or is pierced, and what is inside it comes out as pus, and a hollow space remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin that is over it is like a cloth that has already been thinned, and it does not reach the deepest corruption, nor does it press on bone, nerve, or ligament: it deserves to be called a sinus and is not called a fistula: however, if its space extends until the corruption reaches one of these parts, then it is called a fistula or zuken.

[] [2]
 When an abscess occurs in any of the fleshy parts and becomes chronic and eventually collects pus, and then it breaks open or is perforated, and all the contained matter comes out and the site is left hollow, like a vessel, and the overlying skin thinned like a rag, but the suppuration has not gone so far as to involve bone or tendon or ligament—and hence it merits the name of 'sinus' and is not called a fistula.

[] [3]
But if it goes on until the disease involves any of these parts it is then called a fistula or defluxion.

[21] []
Then cut a hole with scissors directly at the opening of the sinus, slightly larger than the sinus opening.

[22] []
Then spread mild ointments over another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it over the area, keeping it slightly away from the sinus opening, to ease the exit of pus from it; and do not remove the large cloth except once after a few days.

And among them are those with stars.

[7] []
Those that lodge in certain parts of the body fall into two categories.

[8] []
Either they are in the principal hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar parts.

[9] []
Therefore, when it lodges in any of these parts, and signs of death appear to you, which I will tell you later, you must avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows in most cases.

[10] []
And when these evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the part, then extract it and treat the wound.

[] [4]
The difference due to the part transfixed by the arrow is twofold: for there are either the chief hollow organs such as the brain, the heart, the liver, the lungs, the kidneys, intestine, bladder, and so forth—when one of these arrows transfixes an organ of this kind, and you observe the signs of death which I shall describe to you later, then you must avoid the extraction of the arrow in that case, for death will generally follow; but when you do not see these fatal signs and the arrow is not quite buried in the depths of the organ, then extract it and dress the wound.

[15] []
And something similar to the watery discharge of flesh exits from it.

[] [10]
 If the arrow hits the liver, there ensues violent pain, and blood flows from the wound, resembling the liver in its redness.

[68] []
If, however, the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head and has already entered one of the brain’s ventricles, and some of the symptoms I mentioned appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it, until the condition stabilizes after some days.

[69] []
For if the arrow reaches the membrane (sifach), then death is not delayed for him.

[70] []
But if the arrow is only fixed in the bone itself, and does not penetrate to the membrane, and the patient remains stable for some days without any of those symptoms occurring, then proceed with ingenuity in pulling and extracting the arrow.

[71] []
If it is firmly fixed and does not yield to traction, then use drills around the arrow as I told you, and then treat the area until it heals.

[99] []
And the shape of the blunt pusher.

[] [67]
The solid thruster.

[101] []
The tip of this hollow pusher is hollow like a bird's feather, so that the entry of the arrow into it is eased, as is its pushing.

[22] []
Then place a ball under the armpit if you need it.

[23] []
Then take a himematem, that is, a wheel held by the Saracens, which is very long and about the width of a palm or close to it.

[24] []
Then place a folded pad over the tow and plaster.

[25] []
Then take a splint made from a thin board, about three fingers wide and of similar length.

[26] []
Then wrap it in cloth.

[27] []
Then wrap that cloth and splint in place with the himematem over the fracture site and location.

[28] []
Then place the himematem over the fracture as it wraps around, and wind it over the patient’s neck, under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit; adjust it around so that the binding holds the fracture in a fitting way. This is what will ensure the splint is not removed from above the fractured bone.

[] [19]
As to bandaging the bone when it is without wound or incision, it is thus: apply over the bone the plaster composed of mill-dust with egg-white and put over it soft tow; then put a pad in his axilla if necessary; then take a very long sling about a span broad; then place a doubled pad over the tow and plaster; then take a splint made of thin board; its width should be three fingers and its length the same; then wrap it in a rag; then wrap the rag together with the splint in that part of the sling that is over the site of the fracture; then tie the sling round the fracture and wind it round his neck and under his sound axilla and under his injured axilla and carry it several times in every direction as you judge best that the bandaging will hold the fracture firmly, for it will be apparent to you.

[34] []
Then renew the dressing if you see his face inclined toward it.

[35] []
And add to the compression, and leave it until it heals and hardens.

[] [24]
Then renew the plaster if you think it necessary, and bandage again and leave until the fracture of the collar-bone is set and knits.
