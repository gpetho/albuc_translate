Chapter 70.
On the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is in two ways: one is when it appears in the space in the covering of the testicles, in that between the two testicles there is a figure like a female vulva in which there is hair.
And sometimes from it flows urine which is in the covering of the testicles.
But in women it is one type: and it is that the vulva of the woman above the pubis is like two testicles of a man a little extending outward like the foreskin of a man and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: two for men and one type for women.
And it is that you need to cut those attached flesh until the appearance of it is removed, then treat them with wound care.
And in the second type in men from which urine flows that is in the covering of the testicles, there is no treatment or operation for it.
