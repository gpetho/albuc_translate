 CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE.
On cauterization for toothache.
 When the toothache arises on account of cold, or if there be a worm in the tooth, and medical treatment does not avail, then cauterization should be undertaken.
There are two ways of doing this, one with butter, the other with the cautery.
Cauterization with butter is done thus: take cows' butter and let it boil in an iron ladle or pan; then take cotton wool, wind it round the top of a probe, and dip it in the boiling butter and quickly apply it to the aching tooth and hold it there till cold.
Repeat this a number of times till the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
If you prefer, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and put it on the aching tooth, then on top of that apply the hot iron until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
The actual cautery is administered thus: take a tube of bronze or iron with some thickness in the body of it so that the intensity of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat a cautery whose figure will be given shortly, and apply it to the tooth itself and hold your hand until the cautery gets cold.
Do this several times over; the pain will certainly depart the same day or the next.
After this cauterization the patient is to fill his mouth with good butter and keep it in for a while, then spit it out.
This is the figure of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you prefer according to circumstances.
This is the figure of the tube.
