Chapter twenty-six on cauterizing the stomach.
If there occurs in the stomach coldness and many humors until it puts it out of its temperament, and the fluxes to it increase, and it is treated with various kinds of treatment, but it is not effective
then it is necessary that the sick person lie on his back and extend his legs and his hands
then cauterize him with three cauterizations
one cauterization below the xiphoid process, the size of a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery iron
and two cauterizations below, on the sides of the single cauterization, so that the shape of the cauterizations becomes a triangle
and put a distance between them so that they do not merge if they suppurate
and let the depth of the cauterization be two-thirds of the thickness of the skin
and let the shape of the cauterizations be according to this image and according to this amount, without any addition
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach in this manner:
And the cautery iron with which this single cauterization is performed will be in the shape of a circle in this form:
And the stomach may be cauterized by spotting, for those who are afraid of this cauterization.
And it is that you mark spots on the stomach in the amount you want, with ink.
Then you cauterize it with a spotting cautery iron.
Then you treat it with the treatment mentioned previously, until he recovers.
