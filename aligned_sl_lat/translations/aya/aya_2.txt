After I have completed for you the book, Son, of what is last in science and medicine with its supplement, and having finished it from its explanations and declarations, I found it necessary to complete it with this treatise which is part of surgery, that is, of the art of the hand.
Since the operation with the hand is set down in our region and at our time entirely private: until perhaps the science of it has perished, and its track has been lost: and there remain of it only a few descriptions in ancient books, which have been modified by hands: and it has happened to them error and hesitation, until their intentions have been closed and its meaning has been extended: It has seemed to me that I should make clear it with the arrangement of this treatise according to two things, that is to say, according to explanation and declaration, and abbreviation: and that I should bring to light with forms of tools Cauteries, and the rest of surgical instruments: for as much as it is necessary to add a declaration and to proclaim its proper meaning.
Because of the reason that a good artisan with his hand is not found in our time: for the art of medicine is long and an author needs to be exercised before it in the science of anatomy which Galen tells of, until he knows the joints of limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and vessels, and their numbers, and their expansion, and beating pulse, and quietness, and places of departure.
And for this reason Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken about him at the beginning of this book.
Since who is not aware of that which we have said about anatomy, does not clear up, but falls into error, in which men fall by forming themselves from this science, and boast of it without knowledge and without experiment.
What is, for I saw a dull physician strike an escrofulous apophelitic patch on the woman's neck, and he struck some blood vessels in the neck: why did the woman's blood flow until she fell dead between her hands?
And I saw another physician who assumed that he would extract a stone from the man's genitals, which had been causing him trouble for a long time, and the stone was large. So he went to him, and with a twig of holly he extracted it himself. Why did the man die on the third day?
And I had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the great size of the stone, and the condition of the nurse, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who was taking a fee from the Duke of our land for medicine: and there happened to be a black eunuch with him, who was sitting by his side, and he broke the bone in his thigh near the heel; and the doctor persisted in his ignorance, and he bound the fracture to the shin with strong strands of thread, and did not cease from the wound's discharge.
Then he set him free according to his desires. Then he dismissed him after a few days and commanded him not to loosen the bonds; and he stood thus until his leg and foot were withered away, and came to ruin.
So I was called to him: and I eased the bonds; and there followed a time of peace, and he was free from his pains.
However, the corruption had already been confirmed in the member; and I could not restrain it.
So then the corruption ceased to walk in the member until it died.
And I saw another physician who pierced an escrofulous ulcer; and it was ulcerated for some days, until the disease of it was magnified with his lord.
What is, for when it is a pure cancer from melancholy humors, then one should not approach it at all with iron, unless it be in a member that can bear it, so that it may be cut off entirely from it.
And for this reason, I tell you, it is necessary for you to know that surgery is divided into two parts: that is, the operation which is associated with salvation and the operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
And I have already aroused in all places of this book, where surgery has come, in which there is terror and fear.
Why is it necessary for you to be careful of that, and to avoid it: so that you do not find a stupid ear when speaking and dishonoring.
Therefore take a measure with care and protection, and bring the sick of you with ease and firmness, and use a better way, which is led by the grace of God to salvation and a worthy succession: and remove terrible diseases difficult to heal: and remove your souls from that which makes you afraid, so that it enters upon you a hesitation in your faith and comfort.
For it remains more remaining to our glory, and sublime in the world, and lastly to the quantities of you.
For Galenus has already said in some of his advice. Do not heal bad health: do not name yourself a doctor of evil.
I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
Chapter one.
Chapter one. On the caution with fire, and the caution with acute medicines, raw materials, and the order from the head to the feet, and the shapes of instruments, and tools: and whatever is necessary in the operation.
Chapter two.
Chapter two. On section and perforation, phlebotomy and wound-binding, and ulcers: and extraction of arrows, and similar things: and all the chapter in order from the shapes of instruments.
Chapter three.
On restoration and dislocation, and cure of twists, and similar things: chapter in order from the head to the feet, and the shapes of instruments.

Si in venis, aut in arteriis, aut in nervis, aut in viscis innominatis, scitote complexe:
Also, many wise men spoke and disagreed with each other, and indeed a little of their speech is enough for me, fearing prolongation.
I therefore say that cauterization is universal for all complexions, which are with substance and without substance; excepting two complexions, which are a warm complexion without substance and a dry complexion without substance.
In a warm and dry complexion with substance they disagreed. Some have said that cauterization is helpful in this one. And others have said the opposite of this, namely that cauterization is not appropriate in a disease that is of heat and dryness: for fire's nature is hot; and it is inappropriate, as it will heal a disease of hot and dry from hot and dry.
And he who says the opposite of this said: "By cauterization a benefit is brought about in all diseases of heat and dryness that occur in human bodies": for when you compare the human body with its humidities to the complexion of fire, you will find the human body cold.
And I myself say by his speech: for from experiment I have discovered that sometimes.
However, it is not necessary to make a comment on that, unless one has already been proved and exercised in the exercise of the last chapter of cauterization, and has known the difference between complexions and the various diseases in themselves, and their causes and accidents, and the course of time for them.
However, there is no danger for you from the other complexions, especially in cold and moist diseases. Now all physicians have come to an agreement on them, and they have not disagreed about the benefit of cauterization with them.
And know, children, that the secret of the cure by fire and the goodness of it when it is combined with medicine while burning is this: for the fire is simple, and its action does not reach unless to the member that is cauterized; and it does not hurt another connected member unless with little harm.
The truth is that the action of burning leads to that which lengthens from the members: and perhaps it causes difficulty in the healing of a member, and perhaps it kills.
But fire because of its own subtlety and beauty of its substance, does not do that, unless it is in excess.
I have indeed made it known to you through experimentation, because of the length of its use and study with art, and its position on truthfulness of things: and through it I excuse the length of speech.
And if it were not, because it is not permitted to my book, I would bring you a secret and mystery in fire, and the quality of its action in its expulsion of bodies, which expels sickness with a philosophical demonstration, which is increased by the minds of your scholars.
And you sons, know that they differ in time when the cautery should be made, and put a better time for the wine.
And I say that the cautery should be made at any time: therefore, because the accident that happens is hidden by the time, it is attracted with the cautery. And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary pains, strong pains, festivities, which do not tolerate delay: because they are afraid of them, that mischief happens, which is greater than a small harm that does not cross due to time.
And do not fall into the minds of your scholars or sons that they do not consider, unless they are common and stupid doctors, that is, that they think that the sickness which is healed by cautery is always a return: and they put that consequence, and the thing is not as they think: because cauterization is not, except in the place of medicine, which changes the complexion, and dries up the humidities that are causes, because of which pains occur.
But the cautery is superfluous over medicine by the speed of its own power and the virtue of its operation, and the dominance of its own: and it is possible that it should bring back sickness at some time according to the complexion of the nurse, and the location of his sickness, and the virtue of it: and that it is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluity in it: and that it achieves it by means of acquisition from food, and similar things from causes, unless there is sickness, in which cautery is administered.
The slight illness in a few members that are superfluous, and the moisture, such as the tooth cautery because of the pain, and similar to it, is possible that that pain does not return in it. But this fits in with the few.
But this word of the ulegy again, which is the last medicine, is a straight word: not to that what they intend in it: because they believe that there is no therapy that brings with it medicine, nor with another after the occasion of the cautery.
But the thing is the opposite of his and the intent, that the cautery is the last medicine, is not, unless when we administer ways of cure in some diseases, and do not bring those medicines: then we administer at the end of this matter a cautery, and it brings forth: so it falls that the cautery is the last medicine of the doctor, not according to the intention which the vulgar and many-sighted doctors understand.
But the ancients said that the cautery with gold is better than the cautery with iron: and they did not say this, except for the equality of gold, and the limitation of its substance: and they said that it does not make a place of pus cauterize. But this is not at all: for I have already tried this, and I found that it does not do so in some bodies without others.
And the cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said. But when you ignite the fire of cautery from gold, it does not appear to you, when it is ignited according to the quantity that you use, because of the redness of gold: and when it comes to its coldness, and if you add to it ignition, it melts in the fire, and turns into leaves.
Why does the craftsman fall from this work: and because of that it is made Cautery with iron with us faster and nearer, according to the straightness towards the action.
And I have already arranged this Chapter in the Cauterium, according to the Chapters; and I have arranged it from the head to the feet, that it may be more easily found by him who seeks it.
Chapter Two: The Head.
Here is the cauterization to the dominion of humidity and coldness upon the brain: which are two causes of sweat, and of a multitude of the flux of humours out of the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and of a multitude of sleep, and of pain of the teeth, and of pain of the throat: and universally all sicknesses, which happen from coldness, such as paralysis, and swelling, and epilepsy, and apoplexia, and similar things from those ailments.
The mode of cauterization is, that you should wash the sick-person: to empty the head by means of a fluid medicinal preparation which cleanses and purifies it; three times, or four times, according to the exigencies of the strength of the illness, and his age, and his custom.
Then command him to wash his head with water. Then make him sit between your hands so that he has placed his own hands upon his chest.
Then place the root of your hand upon the root of his nose between his eyes. And whichever way your middle finger moves, mark that spot with a brand.
Then light the cauterizing fire of olive oil: which has this shape.
Then place the person himself upon the marked spot with the brand, pressing his hands slowly down, and you shall roll him. Then light your hand quickly, and see the place.
If you see already a quantity of the hair of the head, or a quantity of the herbs, then light your hand. And if not, repeat your hand with the iron, or with another one if it grows cold: until you see the bones which I told you.
Then take a little salt, and dissolve it in water, and dip it in the same, and put it on the place: and leave it for three days.
Then put on the place the dip in butter, and leave it until the wound is healed. Then care for that with the ointment of four drugs, until he is healed.
I have said, that as long as a wound remains open, it will discharge pus; why then is it better and more beneficial to dress it freely?
And some of them said, that the skin should be causticated down to the jaw: and the cautery should be held until a certain hard substance of bone is burned up.
Then the wound should be washed after that which has been burned from the bone, then dressed.
And others say, that it is necessary to make an impression with the cautery on the last part, until it enters the jaw a little, so that the bone is broken, which takes place like the shape of a key: or the instrument which women put in a pot with water: and they say, that vapours rise from this place and the open wound is healed in a long time.
Then dress it with the cautery until it hardens.
But these two kinds of cautery do not seem to me at all, unless among some people for fear.
And leave it, in my opinion, is better with the health of that person.
For the head is weakened by continuous solution of its natural substance: as we have testified in the other members: and especially when the head is weak in nature: and the species of cautery first is more healthy and better with me, and I use it: so then work with that when healthy.
Head 3.
When there is a chronic pain throughout the head: and it is prolonged in a sick person, and uses hyoscyamus, and rubs, and caps, and oils, and employment of poultices. And especially if it has already been cauterized with one fire, which we have described, and there is nothing of those things left: then consider. For if the head is wounded and of strong constitution, and is not weak, and a severe cold comes upon it: then cauterize with another fire beneath it slightly. Then cauterize himself on all the horns of his head with the fire we have described, and let not the skin be touched, and a quantity be taken from the bone, as we have mentioned. And cauterize himself with one fire in the back of his head, in a place which is called a vein; and this is a place where a flowing [blood] comes out: and wash your head well in this, and do not discover the bone. For it is because of this that a severe pain comes upon him, and is far removed from the pain of all other head cauterizations.
And I will call this a Cauterization in its place: and it should be that a cauterization which is sharp  [should be used] where the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of the head with a subtler fire, which cauterizes the middle of the head.
Head 4.
When it happens to a pain in a part of the head and a soda, or the pain extends all the way to the eye, and is washed away with cleansing medicines, and the rest of the treatment is given, as I have mentioned in the division of diseases, and does not leave all of this: then cauterization in it is according to two ways: either cauterization with a sharp fire burning while administering: or with iron.
But a Cauterization while the sharp fire burns while administering: it is, as you take one tooth of the other, and scrape it out, and cut off its ends from both sides. Then cut out the place of pain at a time when the phlebotome is standing by, until it does become in it a place under the skin, where the blood is drawn.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso subcute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitte ulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.
And if you wish to do this with some medicines burned, which I wrote in the twelfth treatise, On Burning Medications.
The cauterization of it with iron, however, is according to this method. Of fire, whose form is this.
And it is called a clavis: because the form of the head is like the form of a key, in which there is some curve, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
Then put the iron on the spot and keep your hand: and you shall turn the iron little by little with velocity: and let the quantity that is burned be of the thickness of the skin, as a half of it. And raise your hand so that it is not burned the artery which is below, and does not happen a flow of blood.
Then dip the cotton in salt water and put on the spot, and leave it for three days: then dip the cotton in butter: afterwards cure with ointment until healed.
And if you wish, cauterize this headache with a sharp knife, second time of cauterization. And caue not from the incision of the artery in this headache, not old nor proper.
The mode of cauterizing in an old headache.
When you cure a headache, with what we have said before in the preceding cure, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and is not sufficient to this what we have said from cauterizing first with medicine, or with cauterizing with fire, then you shall put the fire of Cauterium cuttle, until it becomes white after having signs on the spot of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost so: and set your hand down with force, and squeeze it until you hit the artery, and reach all the way to the mouth.
Indeed, you must take care to avoid the continued pain of the jaw, which moves when chewing, from affecting the side or the nerve that moves it, from where the spasm occurs.
And be careful and vigilant about the flow of blood from the artery, which has been severed. For there is a great fear in the disconnection of it, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent or skilled: and he suspends the operation with it at first.
And I come to remind you of the treatment of the flow of blood from an artery as a second mode, and in the place of this book.
That if you see from sickness that it is not sufficient for this cautery, and you see the body with a wound that accepts the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have told you, care for the wound until it heals.
And if you see, administer the cautery that we have said in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery tool having two knives. For cauterization is better this way and confers more benefits.
On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.
When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and is treated with poultices, and the remaining treatment as we have said in the division, and the pain does not go away, then apply fire-cauterization: and that is what is called a "punction," whose shape is this.
Then the punctures with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it is relieved: or around either of them if the pain is simultaneously on both. And extend it with the cautery from the root of the ear somewhat, after you have marked the places with the caustice: and let the amount of cautery be ten points throughout the whole ear, and almost as many.
Then care for the place, until they are healed.
On the method of cauterizing in torture.
Chapter VII.
Tortura quæ curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciesbus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in divisionibus aegritudinum.
And the separation of cauterization by species which occurs from drying and spasm of nerve.
When you treat this species of torture with hyoscyamus, and caustics, and gargarisms, and your treatment does not bring about a cure, then you should cauterize the disease in three places: one at the root of the ear, and second slightly below its time, and third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part. Since softening does not occur except in the part which appears healthy.
And the shape of the cautery is such that it cauterizes itself directly at the extreme tip of the upper ear below the hairline: and another in time: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb. And place your hand with the cautery on it until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the shape of the cautery, and its species is from a blade whose preceding form is: however, it is not so fine as you see: and it should be a little blade in it with some excess thickness.
Then care for the place, with what precedes it: until it heals.
The way to cauterize in ancient apoplexia.
When ancient apoplexia is established and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not bring about a cure, and the person has no fever, then you should cauterize him with four cauteries on all the corners of his head, and one in the middle of his head as we have said, and one at the back of his head, according to what preceded: and the shape of the cautery is according to what preceded.
Also cauterize with the cautery on the jaw: and it is more last.
Then treat it with what preceded it.
CHAPTER IX.
It is necessary that in the first place, when a person is ill, he drink a great deal of water, and pills to cleanse the brain.
Then rub the whole head with oil of olive, and place over his scalp a plaster of syphilis described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it sometimes.
This is the method of cautery: and do it according to the order given above.
But if he recovers by means of it, it is good. But if he does not recover: then apply to his posterior part of the head three cauterizations, which are descending from the upper part of the head all the way down to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cauterization a thick layer of oil.
Then care for the cauterizations, with what preceded it.
But if you wish to add something, and the patient can bear it: then apply to him a cauterization in the middle. That if you wish to add something: then cauterize him over two horns.
Then care for the patient until he recovers: and let the cauterization be with oil according to the form given above.
The way to cauterize when there is paralysis or softening.
CHAPTER X.
It is necessary that you proceed with the brain's purification and with what I have said.
Then rub the head with oil for purification: then apply to him a cauterization in the middle of the head, and one over each horn of the head, and three over the posterior part of it, and two over the spinal cord.
But if the patient is not comfortable with softening of his whole body, and he can bear it, but his illness is strong: then apply to him four cauterizations over the spinal cord, and the last with a cauterization while burning his skin until it comes out entirely, and wash your hand. Then care for him, until he is healed; and so cauterize with olive oil.
The method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
He should not be cauterized who has a feverish condition.
Therefore let the wounds of his brain be first washed with hyssop and with the other remedies we have mentioned: when he is very sick, or bears up poorly to the reception of medicines.
But if he is a boy who does not bear up to the medicines, then let him have a gargle and tooth cleaning that purifies the brain, these many days before the good feeling returns.
Then wash his head well, and then cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of his head, according to the method we have described: and with another cautery behind, and on all the ridges of his head. If he is strong and bears up, then cauterize him with the methods I have described for having paralysis, and for softening the body above the vertebrae of the neck, and those of the back: and let the cautery be olive oil according to the method already mentioned.
But if the boy is sick, then let the cautery be sharp, according to this mode.
The method of cauterizing in melancholy.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupted湿 and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries I have described for having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is excessive withdrawal from the world into melancholy, and his body is wet with湿: then give him in a drink what purifies his brain, according to the method we have described: then wash his head well, and then make a loop of linen folded twice, like a circle.
Then let him put it in the middle of his head: and let the sick man sit holding on to all sides.
Then present the liniment. It is worthy to learn from the ancient book. And heat him up with a moderately hot fire, when a finger is inserted into it and finds it pleasant. Then empty him out in the middle of his head in a circle, and let him go until he cools down.
Make him sick once a week with some medicine while maintaining the rest of his treatment good until he is healed.
Or if you want to make him well, make small cuts in his body a lot, except for the hand which you hold with the caustic: burn it.
This kind of burning moistens the brain with its quality.
Then put a sponge soaked in butter, or chicken fat on top of him.
This is the way to burn someone with water going down to his eye.
Chapter 13.
When you see the beginning of water in his eye through the signs which I mentioned in the distribution, then begin and drink with him while he washes his head.
And keep him away from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath, on some days on an empty stomach.
Then tell him to scrub his head, and burn him in the middle of his head. Then burn him on both temples with two caustic substances, if the descent of water is in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if the descent of water is in only one eye: and cut off all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the caustics be long in width.
If you see anything of that, then cut it off right away with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in extracting the arteries, and cutting them off, and taking care of the flow of blood.
And when he is burned in wax between two bones with two caustics at the end:
This is the way to burn someone in ancient tears.
When the tears of the eyes are old and persistent, and they flow over the eyelids and the arteries that lie on the outside of the head, it is because of the cold humor and the phlegmatic one; then cauterize with the same cautery that I mentioned at the beginning of the flowing water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over the two temples, and two cauteries on the top of the skull under the two bones. And if there is an increase with the addition, then cauterize it in all sides with careful eye, on the end of the brow with a small cautery.
The way to cauterize the nose while it is foeting.
When you are treating it, with the same thing that I mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help; then hurry up, and give three nights of soup to the patient: afterwards shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an oil-cauter Then cauterize it with a clavium cautery, with two cauteries, on the two eyebrows just under the hair.
And guard the artery so that you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the clavium cautery.
The way to cauterize the eyelids while they are softened.
When the eyelids of the eye are softened by illness or moisture; then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery, with the lunar cautery.
And if there is water, then cauterize it above the two eyelids with two cauteries on all parts: and let them be stretched from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the brow: and do not move your hand away from the cautery, but second by second according to the amount that is burned, the third eyelid.
The way to cauterize the eyelid when the hair are turned inward and poking out the eye.
The head of Chapter XVII.
In cauterium then with fire, but first instruct the sick person to remove his hair, if he has any of that kind which is removed by those who clean it, until they grow and are even. But if he stings him at the place of his birth: then squeeze his eyes with vitriola, so that they do not move, until they come.
When they are even and grown, then place the sick person's head in your lap: and then mark on the eyelids of his eyes withencausta, a mark that is according to the figure of the leaf of mistletoe: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hair.
Then put on the eye a wet pad of white of egg, or of psyllium mucus.
Then set fire to the cautery, which is of this shape:
Then set fire to the cautery on the figure that you marked slowly with many stokes, until all the surface of the skin is burnt away, which is like the shape of the leaf of mistletoe, whole appears complete in itself.
And the mark of health of your work is this: that if you shut the eyelids of the eye and remove the hair near the place where it hurts.
So then let your hand go, and let him be well after a few days.
Then put on the wound a pad of butter, until the scar is removed. Then take care for the wound with ointment, until it is healed.
But if any of the hair comes off after an hour, and softens the eyelid: then repeat the cauterization on that place, as you did at first.
But if the hair is in the lower part: then cauterize that place, until it moves to its own place: and make even so that the hair of the eye does not sting.
He should teach the sick person to remove hair until it grows back and is even. Make in the form of a leaf from the bark of the mimosa tree.
Then take from it, having first well-soaped and from a footweight or nearly so: then dry it all at once with good friction, and make it quickly, lest it become cold. Then from this itself on the paper which you made like the form of a leaf of mimosa, and place it upon the eyelid of one or two eyes. And place under the eye a cotton swab dipped in Albumen or so: and let the head of the sick person lie in your lap.
Then place your finger tip upon the medicine and press it lightly on to the eye. And you move it whenever the sick person feels the tingling of the medicine, for his tingling is like fire.
While he persisted in this, that which himself discovered as to the tingling, then dismiss the medicine, and move it with your finger. When the tingling ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid uplifted, as though it were uplifted by contraction with fire, or with an incision, is good: and if not, then repeat upon it from the medicine upon a spot where it impresses not, and does not mar, until your operation has equated it, and the eye closes.
Then place upon it Cotton dipped in Butter, until the drying-off of the dry skin. Then take care of the eye with a Diaphoric ointment, or some other, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, while you are engaged in the operation, that you keep the last guard, lest anything of the medicine should fall into the eye.
That if the eyelid becomes soft after days, and fights against some hair in the eye, then repeat the medicine upon that spot which becomes soft from the eyelid of itself, as you did in the first place. Then the care for him, until he is healed.
And this is the form of the wound of the mortified part.
And you should know that the eyes of men differ in size and shape. Therefore, according to this second consideration, your mind should be fixed on the right path, which is the subject of this art.
Method of cauterizing the lacrimal fistula.
When you treat a fistula, as you have said in the division of diseases, and your treatment is not effective: then you should cauterize it according to this method.
Prescribe to the sick person that he should place his head in your lap, and hold it between your hands so that it does not move or shake while you are performing the cauterization.
Then put the coturnic infusion on his eyeball or on the mucus of the psyllid; then apply the cautery, which is of this form.
It should be made into a tube, like the feather of a penknife at one end, which is to be used as a cautery; and if the knife goes down to the other end, and if the knife is held up so that it sways:
However, this tube is better suited for your purpose.
Then express the fistula if it is open, and remove the pus from it, and dry it up; and if it is not open, then open it and remove the pus.
Then apply the cautery to it, which is to be set on fire brightly.
And hold the eye, a little away from the cautery from the side of the nose, so that your hand does not move or shake the sick person; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and break it up.
If then you put the tip of your cautery all the way to the nose, it will be good. And if not: then apply the cautery once or twice more, if you can stand it; and then let it go for three days.
Then put on the poultice with butter, and cure yourself with the drying ointment, until it heals.
If it does not heal after forty days, then put on a sharp corrosive medicine over it, until the bone is discovered: and read it after what comes next in his chapter.
And there is another method of cauterization by the fistula, which some have said first. Begin at the place of the fistula, and find it: then put into the fistula a fine cannula, that is to say, a fine tube, whose shape is like this. And pour into it a quantity of liquid lead, and hold your hand with the cannula so that it does not move at all, so that it does not run, or so that the liquid lead does not reach his eye.
And you should put on a poultice over his eye for an infirm person in milk of dates, or in water.
For lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a wonderful cure.
If the fistula heals, along with what we have said about cauterization and cure, it is good. And if not, then it is necessary to administer the opening of the nose, and reduce the fistula to its natural course of the nose, according to what comes next in his place.
On the method of cauterizing in the wounds of the lips.
Fissures often occur in the lip, which are called pilis, and especially in the lips of boys.
When you treat these wounds of the lips, along with what we have said about dividing diseases, and if there is no cure, then a small paring knife, sharp, from fire cautery, in this form.
And set it close to his surface according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then put the lit knife quickly into the lip's wound, until the fire reaches the bottom of the wounds.
Then cure the lip with a green ointment, until it heals.
To cauterize a fistula of the mouth.
When there is a abscess at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then pus comes out, and ruptures: afterwards it dries up, and pus runs, and a fistula forms: then one should care for that, and there is no cure for it, then one should cauterize the fire according to the quantity, which enters the fistula. Then introduce the fire itself into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand, until the iron flame reaches its depth, and its last part: do this once, or twice.
Then care for that after that, as we have said above, until it is cured.
But if the pus is cut off, and heals, it will be well. And if not, then one must detect the place, and remove the corrupted part according to what comes out at its head.
The way to cauterize in the gums, and in soft teeth.
When the gums are softened by moisture, and the teeth move, and have no cure with medicines: then put the patient's head on your lap.
Then take the fire-cathartic, of whose shape we have said above, so that you should put it on the tooth: and quickly introduce the ignited fire into it: and hold your hand a little, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire reaching its root.
And wash your hand: then repeat the cauterization several times, according to what you wish.
Then fill the sick person's mouth with salt water, and keep it for an hour: and spits it out.
For the teeth become firm, and the softened gums are drawn together, and the corrupt moisture is dried up.
The way to cauterize in toothache.
When the pain of the tooth is because of coldness, or there is coldness itself, or peeling, and treatment does not agree with medicines: then cautery is in it according to two ways: either cautery with butter: or cautery with fire.
But the cautery of it with butter is, that you take butter thin and melt it, and boil it in an iron vessel, or in a clout. Then take a knife, and rub it on the tip of the tongue. Then dunk the tongue into the melted butter: and place the tongue on the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it begins to cool down: then repeat it several times, until the fire's power reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you want, dip the hair, or a knife in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth: and place an iron heated red-hot on it, until the fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.
But the cautery with fire is, that you direct the air pipe, or the iron pipe. And remain in his body some grossness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth weak.
Then light the fire-cauterization, of whose shape you have made; and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand, until the cautery cools down.
Do it sometimes, for the pain will be relieved, or in that very day, or in another day.
And it is necessary to impress the cautery on it, that he may fill his sick mouth with good butter, and hold it for an hour: then let him spit it out.
This is the form of cauterization.
Cauterize with whatever limb you can, according to what is possible: and this is the form of the tube.
De the mode of cauterizing in Stromas.
When the Stromas are enflamed with phlegm, and from cold humors, and do not submit to treatment by medicines, and want to digest them quickly: then there is a fire-cauterization, of whose shape this is:
He has two open extremities, so that smoke should come out from the other end when cauterizing: and place the lit coals on the hematoma once, and second, if you tolerate it, until it reaches the depth of the hematoma.
That if the hematoma is small: then place the cauterizer according to the quantity of the hematoma.
Then release the patient after three days, and place on the wound a vat filled with milk, until what has been burned is removed by the milk.
Then care for the patient with the tooth ointment, until the wound is healed in shape of a cannula.
The mode of cauterizing in laryngitis and constriction of breathing:
When there is moisture above the larynx and especially when it is with a cold complexion, then it should be let out the sick person first with liquid medicines dissolved.
Then cauterize the patient's throat with a cruciatus at the root of the larynx in a depressed place: and be careful, so that you do not go with the cautery to the throat or skin, unless something of it.
Then cauterize the patient with another cautery at the joint of the neck in last place of the spine of the last one, and second: and let the cautery be a claw according to the mode, which preceded.
Then care for the patient with what has preceded, until he is healed.
The mode of cauterizing in diseases of the lungs and cough:
When cough and lung disease are from cold moisture, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor is there tuberculosis, and old illness: then cauterize the patient with two cauters above the collarbone in depressed places, gently, and smoothly. And another cautery in the middle of the chest between two breasts: and let the cautery be a cannula according to the shape which preceded.
And if you want to mark your cauterization by puncturing with the cautery, which is called a Punctuation, whose shape preceded in puncturing pain of ears: and let there be punctures from twenty to almost thirty.
Then take care of himself with what preceded him, until he is healed.
And now let the cauterization be having three branches: in this form. Why the cauterization is all right with him, when you make with him one-third of a cauterization.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the adjunctor is dislocated by moisture, and does not return to its own place at all from its dislocation, until it has become accustomed to reducing itself, then dislocates with little motion, which we have already testified to you concerning it, then it must be reduced that dislocation in the beginning. Then he shall lie down on his sick bed, or on his healthy side. Then anoint him with olive oil, which is within the inner Titillicus to the upper ones with your fingers of your left hand: and if a joint is dislocated to the interior.
Then take cauterization by fire having two edges. Whose form is this.
Then anoint him with oil, until it penetrates to another side, and let the figure of cauterization be with four cauterizations.
And when made cauterization with cautery having three edges, why the figure of cauterization is then six cauteriums: and are the edges according to the subtility of the touch.
And this is the form of the cauterization having three edges.
And when added to this mode one, why are the cauteriums eight.
Then put on cauterization with crushed pores with salt. Then make him adhere to tranquility, so that he does not move a limb at any time, until it is comforted.
And if the dislocation is to the upper ones, and does not happen often, then cauterize him with a cautery on the shoulder, or with many cauterizations by puncturing it.
Let the wound be sewn up, and let the moisture be dried: and let the sick be made well.
The stomach should be cauterized in this way.
When cold and great moisture happen in the stomach, until they have taken it out from its own skin, and there are many discharge to it, and frequent methods of cure, and do not confer: then it should be laid down on his back, and extend his legs, and his hands. Then cauterize with three cauterions, a cautery of the size of a finger under the chest, and two cauteries below on either side, a cautery each, until there is a triangular figure. And make long between each one so that they do not join together, when they are doing pus.
And there should be depth of the size of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And there should be a figure of the above form without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and there should be a cautery that is made for this cautery one according to the form of a circle.
And the stomach should be cauterized by piercing it who is frightened by this cautery: and is, so that the signs are on the stomach's point according to the quantity you have with caustics: then cauterize it with a piercing cautery: then care for the stomach with cure that has preceded until it heals.
The way to cauterize the neck is cold.
When it happens in the throat a pain from cold and moisture, or from a thick wind, until it comes out of its own skin with natural exit of waste, and cure the sick with that which I have said, and it does not benefit to him: then it should be laid down on his chest his back, and three cauterions according to this form, and this quantity the same over the neck below the hypocondrium, where the bed is reached by man: and there should be space that is between each cautery according to its thickness, a finger: and there should be a cautery according to the length of the body, straight: and do not squeeze your hand with the cautery much.
And let there be a quantity of that which is heated by the thickness of the skin, a quantity of its half not added; and let the sick stand on his feet.
But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, for he has already extended his limbs and raised his arms.
This is the form of the operation.
And you may also be able to do this cautery with a scalpel when there is subtlety and wisdom with you in the art.
And guard yourself, so that you do not proceed too far in the cauterization, and the thickness of the skin is heated throughout, for it is heated throughout the body, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin is there thin, so know that one.
On the mode of cauterizing the liver pustules.
When it comes to the exit of the liver pustules, and you wish to know, if that pustule is in the liver meat, or in its lining: then, if it is in the liver meat, you will see a pain that weighs down, and there is no acuteness: and if it is in the liver lining, with a sharp pain: and you will see that the treatment of doctors fatigues him.
Therefore let the sick person lie down on his chest. Then, the figure of the place of the pustule with the caustic: then, the fires of the cautery that it absorbs by radiation. And this is its form. And cauterize with that same cautery, until the skin is completely burned over, and it reaches the syphac, until it comes out completely: then take care of his treatment for the treatment of pustules, until he is healed.
And it is not necessary that this cautery be used at the sight of one who has been studying the art of medicine for a long time: and through whose hands some diseases have sometimes passed with experimentation: for then let him dare to perform such an operation.
But, in my opinion, it is better to leave it alone.
If the pleural cavity is to be cauterized...
The ancient ones said that they used the roots of aristantho to cauterize the pleura in a cold manner according to this method... And you should obtain the dry roots of aristantho, one long root which is found there, and make it as thick as a finger... Then immerse it in oil: and set it alight on fire... Then cauterize with one cauldron between the clefts of the collarbone and two small ones under the chin a little to one side, which is under the beard...
And two more cauldrons in the middle of the chest, a little to one side, and another one below the stomach, and another above the stomach... And three cauldrons from behind: one in the middle of the two ribs: and two cauldrons on either side of the chest, lower cauldron which is between the two ribs...
And you should not compress your hand with the cauldron, but rather let it hang out so that it smells bad...
And some ancient people said that they used to use an iron cauldron of similar size: and set it alight, and put it inside the body between the ribs until it had reached the appendage, and brought out pus, as we have said before in the description of the liver...
But in this piercing with the cauldron there is a fear that either the weak one immediately dies, or a fistula occurs at the place, which cannot be healed...
On the splenectomies...
When you are treating the spleen disease, as we have said before in the division of the diseases, and if your treatment is not effective, then cauterize it according to three methods which are all correct...
One of these is that you make three cauldrons, or four in a line according to the length of the spleen according to the shape of the caulteries of the liver, which preceded this figure...
And be between all cautery quantity of thickness of the digit, or more a little.
And be the mode of cauterization, which we said in the cauterization of the liver equally.
And do not compress your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie on his back.
And another mode of cauterization is: that the fire of the cautery has two edges, which we said in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and raise up the skin, which is in direct splenis, where it reaches the bed of the sick on the left side: and let your elevation be as you raise up the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterization falls according to the length of the body.
Then introduce two hot edges, until you pierce the skin from the other side: then remove the cautery: so there are four cauterization.
And if you wish to cauterize with a cautery having three edges.
Then the care of the cauterization after you have sent it off to emit pus after many days: for indeed it is more effective that which remains behind from the cure.
The mode of cauterizing in Hydropsis.
The cautery does not fall in Hydropsis, unless it is properly raised up.
When you cure Hydropysis with the modes of cure which we have said in the division, and there is no cure, then it is necessary that you cauterize the umbilicus four times, and one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly in the chest, and one directly in the stomach: and be the thickness of the cauterization close to the thickness of the skin.
Then remove the open cautery, that it may emit pus after a long time.
And do not wet the sick man with the cure after the cautery with it: for it is necessary that there be two intentions against it, and will hasten to the cure with the help of God.
Form indeed the cautery with which cauterized is the gut, be closed: for the form of it; and his with which cauterized is the back, be oiled: for the form of it.
De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et crura.
When they are put into the hydropeatic, and fill with yellow water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and the ring: and oil your hand with the cautery, and do not twist him: then oil your hand: and do not return to him at all.
For the water is yellow, and set the cautery according to this form.
Then do on the two legs the two cauteries in all the leg, and let the cautery be made with the extreme of the knife-edge of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other lower than that, about in the middle of the leg: and on all the back the two cauteries: and do not let the cautery be closed without a long time of curing: so that it resettle from it some water: then cure yourself with the rest.
De modo cauterizandi in solutione ventris.
De modo cauterizandi in solutione ventris.When you are curing in the solution of the belly, you must be careful not to go beyond the form that is indicated: for if you go further, it will produce an opening, and then there will be a great danger of peritonitis; and it will be necessary to wait until the wound has cicatrisated, before going on with the cure.
When the solution of the belly is from cold and moisture, until the virtues of retention and digestion, which are in the stomach and intestines, have weakened; and cure it with the methods of curing, and do not heal: and you will see one that tolerates the exuberant virtue of cauterization, then cauterize yourself with a large cautery on his own belly, according to what has gone before in the cauterization of the stomach with a small cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a small cautery: and a cautery above the alhosos with a large one, or two cauteries.
And if you see abundant humidities and the sick one tolerating it, then cautery him with cautery on the chest and cautery on all the iliacs: and perhaps you have added two small cauteries near the stomach.
For cure is perfect, whose remedy does not err.
(On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.)
CHAPTER III. ON THE CAUTERIZATION OF HEMORRHOIDS.
(When there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are of thick humor, cold, or corrupt humors, and this treatment, which we have mentioned in the division, does not help, then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower part of the back of the loins under an almond-shaped triangle somewhat, and cautery under the navel almost like two fingers.
And if you consider that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see his face pale, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has preceded: and cautery on the small intestine, and another on his spleen, with a cautery on the claw: and leave the cautery open at times: then take care of him, until he is healed.
CHAPTER III. ON THE CAUTERIZATION OF ARTERIOLA после их лигатур. (The head of Chapter III contains the text you provided, but with a different organization and additional details) In primis, curiis colligamus utrum in vasis sanguinis ad arterioles uel ad venulas sunt: si enim ad arteriolas, tunc cum cauterio super pedem arteriae lygamo: si uel ad venulas, tunc cauterimus cum cauterio super pedem venuli.
We first examine whether they are in a vessel of blood to arterioles or veins: if to arterioles, then with cautery on the edge of the artery; if to veins, then we cauterize with cautery on the edge of the vein. And when you cut off the arteriole, then you light the cautery as it radiates. Then introduce the cautery into the cut arteriole: and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood runs: make it once or twice.
If therefore there were many bandages, then cauterize each one according to what we have described. Then care for them, when you have applied the unguent to them, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the Alcate, it is more final in the healing.
The way to cauterize the fistula in the anus.
Chapter 38. The head.
When the sick does not submit to the incision and the operation that we have described in his place, and trembles because of it, perhaps he will be healed with a large cautery.
When therefore someone has a fistula, and it is old, pus runs out of it, and corruption. It is fitting that you should investigate by trying the subtle method. Then recognize the depth of the quantity with a test.
Then fire the cautery, which is like a ray. Then insert yourself with the ignited thing into the fistula and the quantity in which it enters with a clamp.
And repeatedly apply the cautery to her, until all the corrupt bodies are burned up; once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
And protect yourself from the heat of the knife, if there is any, or a large iron; or if the fistula issues into the body of the bladder, or into the body of the intestines, then protect yourself from these places altogether.
And do not perform it unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and consider that it does not penetrate.
Then care for the place until it is healed.
But if the place has been sealed, and tissues have been cut off from it, and remains so for a long time: then know that he is now completely healed.
And if the tissues have not been cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupted hole in its depth, or almost like those: whose memory will remain in its place.
To cauterize veins.
When pain in the kidneys is caused by cold or a gross wind and the patient has been bedridden because of it, then one should cauterize them above the belly button on top of the kidneys, cauterying each kidney with cautery from the claw, whose precedent was a reminder.
And perhaps we should cauterize him again in the same place with cauterizing. Why are there three lined areas? Thus they will be more effective in the cutting.
To cauterize the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture until it does not hold urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the urethra next to the bladder where the hairs start with the comb, and cautery from the right side of the urethra, and another from the left: and let the length of the cauterization be in accordance with the width of the thumb: and cauterize it with cautery from the lower back, or two cauters if you can stand it: and let it follow the order that preceded the claw cautery.
To cauterize the uterus.
When cold and moisture occur in the uterus and it is prevented from pregnancy and its menstrual fluids corrupt, and their arousal is delayed, and pain occurs during intercourse, then one should cauterize them with three cauters around the navel as we have said for cauterizing the bladder, and cautery from below the back with a comb, or two cauters: and let it follow the order that preceded the claw cautery.
To cauterize the anus in a dislocation.
When the mucous membrane of the anus flows out to the rectum, and it is caused by its exit from its place: and the sign of it is that the skin extends on one side when it stands up straight: and the location of the dislocation is found in it a hollow place.
It is therefore necessary that the cautery should be placed on the wound of Acha, with a similar cautery; after you have marked the edge of the wound with wax, as it turns out: and so that it falls itself in the middle of the circle.
That if this cautery is not present in you, then cauterize yourself with three cauteries, with a large oily cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin of all the body.
Then take care for yourself, until it heals.
The way to cauterize in sciatic nerve.
When pain occurs in the wound of Acha, and there is cause for it, cold and moisture: and if the sick person is not relieved with what we have said in distribution, and does not benefit from it, and grows worse: then it is necessary that you should separate the sick from gross humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and like things. Then cauterize him.
And the mode of the cautery in her is according to two ways: either with a cautery with burning medicines, or with fire.
The cautery with fire is according to many ways.
One of them is that you should cauterize on the wound of Acha with three triangular cauteries, according to this form. And let them have a good depth or a bad one. And let there be space which is between every cautery according to the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be with olive oil.
When, however, the cautery is made in the middle on the top of Acha herself. Why are there four cauteries?
And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form has preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of Acha, one: so that the circle contains all Acha.
And burn up the thickness of the skin of all the body.
This is the method for treating sciatica when the pain adheres to the nerve itself and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
But if it extends to the thigh or leg, then cauterize the nerve itself with two cautery tools above the hip, above the place where the patient feels pain, and a third cauterizer on the ankle bone at the side opposite the pain: and let the cautery be sharp.
And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
That if the patient feels that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there with a single cautery tool or with several cautery tools if he tolerates it.
And if he feels pain under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a sharp cautery tool.
And let your cautery be so that you do not accidentally damage the nerves or large arteries, and so that it does not cause more harm to the patient, or a contraction.
And I have already seen one and the other who cauterized above the ankle bone and then ended the cauterization, and the leg swelled up until the foot was completely swollen, and all of it was corroded, and then the solution of the wine came out, and death followed after that.
That if the pain is on both sides at the same time, cauterize each one according to this manner.
And some wise men have said about the cautery of nerves, whose cauterization is this method. Make a similar cut from iron, whose diameter is half the palm's: and let it be at the opening according to the thickness of the finger nail, or a little more: and inside that one let there be another, with a third one.
And let there be space between each finger according to the length of the knuckle nail: and may the openings be on both sides: and may their height be almost like a knot, or two knots: and may they make handles from iron that is unevenly bent in the fingers.
Then it is to be heated in fire until it turns red and gives off sparks; then it is to be placed on a plaster of anchuses laid out on the sound side. So he is to be cauterized with three round wands in one stream of water.
Then let him be left for three days. Then let him be bandaged with butter: and let the hole be left open for many days. Then care for the man with ointment until he is healed.
Says Albucasis, with this kind of cautery on the son, we are a little afraid, because it is a frightening sight; and also, because we have few who wait for him.
However, from good cauterization he who endures this and finds his place with him will benefit.
The cauterizer, when you use it with medicine that is being applied, is to be set up so that it can reach the door frame of his chamber, made of iron or steel, its length being double the height of its walls: at the top of which are to be tied two knots, or nearly so.
And there should be a space that is the length of two fingers in between each; and they are to be open at top and bottom: and it is to contain itself opposite to this form.
Then let it be placed on a plaster of anchuses laid out on the sound side, as the sick man lies on his sound side. And press your hand strongly on the plaster of anchuses. Then pour between the two circles of warm water that is slightly heated with fire, and hold it for a certain period of time; and let the sick man endure the stinging, and his burning, because he will feel the sting as fire, until it is at rest.
Then wash your hand with oil and rinse it thoroughly with sweet water; then let it be left for three days.
And place butter on top of it until the blackness of burning disappears; and let it be left for several days, and let the pus run out from it. It is indeed the last resort in cutting.
Then take care of that with ointment until it heals.
If the pain extends up to the hip or leg: make him rest in that position so that he can contain water, as you did in the case of the wide one.
And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written about it in the treatise on the correction of diseases. Take alkali and burnt limestone on both sides; shake them together, and put them into a new pitcher whose bottom part is pierced by a small hole, according to the quantity that you add; then put under the bottom of the pitcher another pitcher full of water, which shall be immersed in the alkali and limestone with one finger: then after you have well shaken them, remove the upper pitcher, and pour over the alkali and limestone with water from a pitcher, so that it may flow through the hole at the bottom of the pitcher. Then squeeze the two substances with your hand, and let the water go out:
Then collect all the water, and pour it over another limestone: and set it down, until it is cold.
For that will then be very strong and acute, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of the remaining members. Since it will effect the operation of fire itself.
And from medicines there are, with which they cauterize the wide one, also like theriac, and honey of acorn, and lime mixed with soap, so that each may be mixed.
And Galen himself related, of a man from ancient times who was cured of pain in the hip and leg (sciatica): he said that it was very effective. And he said, He did not like another cure, and that he was cured from one leg only, until he told us, That he perhaps entered a hot bath, and came out already healed.
And it is, to be received from the ear-ring of a man: and if it is not found in the ear-ring, it shall be taken like this, fresh: and be tied to the hip, where there is pain, or leg, or in the thigh: and be bound, and left for a quantity of three hours, or per quantity that the sick person feels pain from being disturbed. Then introduce him into the bath.
Once therefore the body becomes cold, introduce him into the tub. For the pain has subsided and he is recovering.
And know that it is not necessary to apply any ointment to these medicines unless after corporal discharge.
And Dioscorides who said that when the stool of goats is applied as a poultice to an acute sciatica, it does him good: and he makes it a second-class poultice in this way. Let the wool be soaked in old oil and placed over a deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Then take the goat droppings as it is, and set fire to it in the fire until it becomes a coal.
Then place the coal on the wool, and leave it there until it goes out. Then repeat that. Do not therefore cease to do this, until the sense of touch on the part of the mediations has come to the anus, and the pain has rested.
And this mode of poultice is called a vaccinal cautery.
[The cauterization of the pain in the back.]
When, therefore, pain occurs in the back from various causes, or from accident, or from blow, or from superfluous discharge, and there are similar cases, from the infusion of cold material, and wet: and cauterization is not done unless in this one kind alone, which is made by the infusion of cold material.
Therefore after discharge of the milk with foul pills, and those similar to them, let three lines be made on the back where the pain is, according to the length of the spine, after having marked with caustics in each line five cauterizations, or more, according to the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the nurse's virtue: and let cauterization be done with a cauteropuncture.
And if you wish, cauterize three or four cauterizations, with a small cauldron in the middle, according to this form.
In order to cauterize in incipient gibbosity.
Often this disease occurs in small children.
And the sign of its beginning in children is this: for it happens to him in a constriction in hiccupping while lifting up and in movement: and in pain in the last spine of the back and in nodules of its, which has already begun to rise above the other spines.
When you see this then when you want to make it, then cauterize him with a cautery that he is in the form of a circle like this.
And he takes the cautery on all parts of the spine equally: and if you want to cauterize it in the circumference of the spine with a point cautery two lines or three: and let the points be close together.
Then care for the place, until it is healed with him that we have said.
And be careful, do not administer the cautery in gibbosity, which is made in spasm of a nerve.
On how to cauterize in podagra and in pain of joints.
When the pains of joints are from cold humidities which flow to any member of the body, then when they occur in the feet, it is the custom of doctors to name this podagra properly.
When however podagra is cured that is caused by cold, with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then let the cautery remove them.
And it is, so that it is cauterized him after evacuation in circumference of joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive oil.
And if you can bear it that points on the face of the foot, then do with a point cautery. That if the pains ascend up to the knees or other joints and often this happens: then cauterize him over all the knee with three cauteries, or four from every side, with this same cautery of Cloyius.
But if you need more of this remedy, then cauterize him then. And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but rather surround it with spice only on the skin.
But if the pains rise to the knees, and to the back: then administer what we have said in our chapter from the cautery.
That if the pains are only in the hands, then prick around with fire, as the two lines run out.
But if any remaining pain remains in the fingers, then prick them, over all the knuckle, and over the palm of the hand.
But if the pains rise after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both sides completely.
And do not throw away a sick patient from good care, from the reception of medicines. For if the regimen is good, and the phlegm is discharged, it will be healed by the aid of God with this cautery.
On the mode of cauterizing in ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine has descended, or it touches the testicle, and that is beginning to be close: then you should order the sick person to cease from eating his own food. And let him use laxatives, so that the feces descend from his own bowels.
Then make him sit between your hands on his back: and order him that he hold his breath, until he goes out, or appears the buttock, or the intestine.
Then reduce him with your fingers, and mark with the wax under the rupture over the jawbone of the neck, with a mark whose end is similar to half a circle on the upper part of the body.
Then light the fire of the cautery, which has this form, until it becomes white, and let it drop sparks. Then reduce the intestine, or the buttock to its concavity. Then let the minister put his hand on the place so that he does not lose the intestine: and you have already opened between the thighs of the nurse, and placed under it a towel, and one serving as another over the thigh, and one holding the hands.
Then place the caustic on top of the wound, with your hand holding the caustic upright. And hold it, until you have succeeded in bringing it to the teeth: or else repeat with it a different force, if you have not succeeded in doing so with it in the first instance up to the teeth.
And carefully observe that no intestinal contents come out during the time of your cauterization, so that you do not burn yourself, and let it pass through in that state to death or great disease.
And know that when you have not succeeded with the caustic in bringing it to the teeth, your operation has not been successful.
And it is necessary that the caustic be subtle for infants, according to their measure.
Then take care with the rest of the ointment, until it has healed over.
And let the patient lie down on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed up.
And it is necessary that you provide him with food according to the length of his cure, which softens his gut: so that he does not pass stool and vomiting.
Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then give him a loose bandage, and let him remain for another forty days.
And let him rest from work, and be filled with food and drink, and loud noises.
For when he uses this regimen, so does he heal in an entire way.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures with incisions in its chapter.
When, however, ruptures occur in the remaining gut, and are incipient, and do not add to themselves, then cauterize the rupture of his gut with a round caustic according to its quantity: and let it be as heated from then on like the third one. Then take care for the patient, with what we have said: and do not add anything.
And some first say: that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular caustic, according to this form.
Afterwards, sign it with the enchain, and place the line which is of the breadth of the back upper rupture, and another line down below it. And put your hand down in the middle with the clamp closed.
But the cautery is easier and better first.
(On the mode of cauterizing in pain because of accident, or percussion.)
[Head 58]
When pain arises in some member through accident or percussion and that pain persists for a long time, and does not respond to medicines: then it is necessary that the cautery be applied with the puncturing cautery.
And let the cautery be of any size suitable to the member, and its soundness, and its weakness, and its strength, and its twist, and its pain therefrom.
But if it is healed by the first cautery, it is well. But if not: then repeat over the same cautery.
For the custom of these pains is that they should change from one member to another as it approaches that which concerns it. Why it is necessary that you should remove these with the cautery until the sick member is healed.
(On the mode of cauterizing in leprosy.)
(Of leprosy. But when lepers walk, they should be cauterized by a heavy cautery.) And especially the species of leprosy, which is produced through the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: so consider well when you are cauterizing this one.
But if leprosy is incurable, and you have treated it with the same cautery that we have mentioned in the division, and it has not gone down, nor remained stationary, but there has been corruption all over its complexion: then cauterize it on top of the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the hairline, and a second lower down towards the front at the end of the hair, and two on either side, and one behind the ear at the nape of the neck.
And last of all, with a little cautery, put the hand on until it impresses a deep impression into the mouth, and dislocates the membranes from it: so that the expiration of thick vapor may be alleviated from it, and cauterize also with the cautery over the spleen, following the above.
But leper has already spread over the sick person, and it is apparent. Then one should perform the cauterizations with these cauterizations that we have mentioned in the head, and a cauterization on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on the two cheeks, and two cauterizations on the two neck vertebrae, and six on the neck back, and one large on the hahosas near the long tail, and one above it, in that same one: and two on the shoulders, namely, on all shoulder one, and two on the knees, and two on the arms, and two on the soft parts of his chest, and cauterize him over all joint, from the joints of his fingers of his hands, and his feet: and cauterize him over all heel of his feet, and the tips of his fingers.
And so that you do not burn them, the nerves that are on the heel of the last foot.
Then when the cauterization is performed with a cauterizing knife on the bone of the jaw, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the parotid gland.
And you should know that the more you add cauterization, the greater the healing is, and the more it confers.
And you should know that a sick person does not feel pain in the cauterization, unlike a healthy person: indeed, his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauterizations be of appropriate size and shape according to the joints and connections: namely, because they precede in order of tools.
Then care should be taken with the cauterizations made from a flour of herbs mixed with honey, and with other cures, until he is healed.
As for the way to cauterize in stupor:
When one of the limbs is stupor and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize the limb that is in stupor with cauterizations, according to whether the size of the limb is increased or decreased.
And let your cautery remain standing in the thickness of the skin a little. Then put the ointment on the wound, until it heals.
And sometimes the cautery is stunned, which happens to hand, and foot, in the spine of back near the exit of nerves, which stir that limb: and the stupor passes away.
But he should not press too hard on it, unless he is wise in anatomy of limbs, and the exit of moving nerves of the body.
Chapter LII.
When Albucasis is burned, and there is no medicine applied in it: then cauterize the wound with a deep cautery a little, according to the thickness of the skin, until the flesh turns white, and the color changes.
Then cure the wound with herb-flour, and rose-oil, and leaves of arnica, and pigeon's blood, and duck's blood: let each part be a separate piece; all these things are to be mixed together, and laid on a cloth, and adhere to the place, until it heals.
[On the mode of cauterizing in cancer.]
When Cancer is beginning, and the vein must be stopped: then cauterize the vein with a circle of the cautery, as it turns round.
But the wise have said, that the last cauterization should be made with the cautery in the middle.
But I do not see that: for I am afraid that it will burst out: and I have seen it sometimes.
And it is better that the cancer should be cauterized round about with a circle as we have said: or else with many cauterizations.
[On the mode of cauterizing in adhesion.]
When anyone has Adubelasia, and is delayed in its maturation, or because it is causing him to be superfluous, or for the sake of his old age when he is few-blooded, or for time, and the eye rushes to maturity, then cauterize around it with little cauterizations by puncturing. Then let go of it. For this will hurry along with its maturation.
But if you poke a hole in it with cautery, then take this shape of fire cautery.
And lay it down in the middle of Adubelasia until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery follow it, so that the course of the pure may be eased.
Then take care of the eye until it is healed.
The method of cauterizing in a corrupting disease.
Chapter LIIII.
Corrosion is not anything but corruption in a wandering member, and it corrupts itself: as fire devours dry wood.
But if you see corrosion in a place that tolerates cautery with fire, then take many cauteries of fire, small tools and big ones, according to what suits it in the place where the corrosion is.
Then cauterize the eye from every part until you have completely eradicated the corruption, and do not leave any of it inside.
Then let go of the eye for three days, and place sulfur triturum with oil on the places that have been cauterized, until all the eschar are eradicated, and all corruption.
Then take care of the eye with unguents generating flesh.
But if you see that after three days meat is born healthy, where there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then repeat the cauterization on the remaining places of corruption.
And corrosion is sometimes cured with acute medicine. For it rises up in the place of cauterization.
But cauterization with fire is faster in its work: and I have already said about cauterizing it with acute medicine in a division: so you take it there when you can endure it.
To cauterize in claws and warts.
Chapter LVI.
A frequent malady in the lower parts of the feet is a gross, filthy disease that afflicts the foot.
There are two ways to cauterize them: with fire and with warm water.
As for how it is with fire, so that the fire-carving is similar to the feathers of a penknife: which let be made of iron, according to the quantity that it contains of the claw from all parts: and be it not too deep at the edge.
Then put the fire-carving itself on the claw. Then turn your hand with the knife around the claw, until the fire-carving has come to the depth of the claw: and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus. Then bind the claw with wild silage, crushed with salt: and leave the embalming on the claw in the night. For it will itself be eradicated from its roots.
Then care for the place with a medicinal ointment of flesh, until it is healed.
If they are not turned, and frequently happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then administer to them warm water-carving: and it is, as you take a tube from brass, iron, or a penknife: and put it on the claw, or althelch. Then throw into the tube a little quantity of warm water: hold your hand, and turn it slightly with the pressure of your hand so that the edge of the tube is imprinted in the root of the claw, and let there be warm water available to reach its depth, to the root of the claw: and expect the sick for about one hour on the sensation of the warm water.
Then leave it, for the claw will be eradicated with its roots.
Thus do with one of them, until you are satisfied that they are all healed over all that are in the body.
Then the care of them after they are cut off, when it is that they generate flesh out of the ointment.
§ On the way of cauterizing in tremor.
When it happens to anyone that there is tremor from cold in a nerve, or from quartan fever, or another kind of fever: then one should make four cauterizations, or five on the spine at the back, and between each spine a cauterization, and in the pit of the stomach a cauterization, and over the stomach a cauterization.
For tremor ceases with the olive oil cauterization, and health of disease of cold quickens.
§ On the way of cauterizing by Albather.
Head LVII.
When Albather-type foods are expelled from the body, that is, pus which is formed from coarse corrupted materials.
Then one should cauterize first when they appear, over the whole head of the pustules with a fine wooden cautery made from myrrh, whose end is heated with fire. Or with the long root of aristo-chyme. Or with a lenticular cauterizer.
And when they are cauterized with a caustic, at first in accordance with this method: they do not increase; and by interrupting the excess they make, they heal from them.
However, one should make that after evacuation with blood-letting.
§ On the way of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in the arm.
This often happens with a flow of blood from an artery that has been cut, which is external, or at the incision of an abscess, or when cauterizing a limb, and such like: and it is difficult to make it stop flowing. Oportet ergo ut facias illud posteuacutem cum phlebotomia, et adhaerendas langes ad rem, quae effert fluxum sanguinis, et adhaereas, et cauteriescas super eum cum cauterio oliuari fortiori, aut sub igni, ut in catula, et cum exiguo caute
When this therefore happens to anyone, then approach with your hand to the orifice of the artery, and put the tip of your finger on it: and grip it tightly until the blood is stopped under your finger, and does not flow out from under it.
Then put on fire small oliy cauterys, and many in great number: and puff thereupon until they are well burnt up.
Then take out of them one, or small, or great, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and lay the cautery upon it, after which you will move your finger quickly: and hold the cautery, until the blood is cut off.
That if you drive away with your finger from the opening of the artery, and put out the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those which are prepared in the fire.
So therefore do not cease to do that with one after another, until the blood is cut off.
And be careful, so as not to burn up the nervy tissue which is there, and let some other evil come upon the sick person.
And you shall know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut off [the tissue]: especially if the artery is large, unless with four fingers. Or with the cautery, as we have said. Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, it shrinks, and the blood is cut off. Or it is tied with a strong ligature. Or they are placed upon the tissue by virtue of their property, from which the blood is cut off, and tied with a pulse-tight bandage.
But he who administers the cutting off of it with a ligature, and tightening with a bandage, or placing burning things and like things upon it, does not give him a deep wound, except rarely.
But if this should happen to anyone, and there is no present physician or medicine: then let the finger of the left hand begin to lie upon the opening of the wound, as we have related, and its constriction well, until the blood which comes from the upper part of the wound is stopped by pressing on it, and lying upon the artery. And let the finger not move away from it, with cool water constantly flowing over it, until the blood has congealed, and thickened, and is cut off.
And meantime he is to consider whether he needs a caustic or medicine.
On incision, perforation, and bloodletting on wounds and similar matters.
We have already spoken in the first chapter of all sicknesses that are treated with a burning caustic and medicine combined, their occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of caustics.
And I placed those chapters from the beginning to the end.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: that is, in order to answer the question of the inquiring person.
And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, O son, that the fear expressed in the first chapter on cauterization applies here.
And for that, it is necessary to be more cautious, since a great deal of blood flows in the operation described in this chapter, which can cause fainting when opening the veins, or incisions on a bruise, or opening an exit from the body, or curing wounds, or extracting an arrow, or incising on a stone, and similar ones: from all of which trembling and fear arise, and death falls from many of them.
And I warn you, so that it does not fall on you, for when people of this art fall into such a state, they often fall from their health with sicknesses of the body. For among them is one who becomes angry with his illness and becomes weak in his disease: because of the severity that he finds in his sickness and the length of his evil. And when the illness is from fear, which signifies death.
And among them is one who gives you a drink, and promises you health, but his illness is destructive.
Therefore it is not right for you to consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such. And let caution be our greater guide than our greed and avarice. And do not presumptiously assert anything from it without certain knowledge, which verifies with you what comes to successful succession worthy of praise.
And so that you may cure all your patients' illnesses, diagnose and indicate what is most suitable for their health.
For in it is your aid in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O sons, with His understanding, and may He not take away your guidance and inspiration: for it is in His hands.
And I have arranged this Chapter by dividing it into Chapters, following the order of Caution, from the crown to the toes: that you may find what you desire from it, and what you need.
On the Cure of Water which is added to the heads of boys.
Chapter I.
You should know that this illness often occurs in boys at birth: or when the midwife presses the boy's head without lightness.
And whenever it also happens for an unknown secret cause which is not known.
And I did not see this illness in anyone else but in boys, and I wished to see all of them die: therefore for that reason I have abstained from operating on them.
And I saw a boy among them whose head was swelled with water, and his head increased in size every day, until he could not sit on himself, due to the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture, or it aggregates between the skin and the jaw: or it aggregates under the bone above the jaw.
And the operation on him, if it is moisture between the skin and the jaw, and there is a small pimple, then you should find a single notch in the middle of the head in width: and the length of the notch should be almost two knots, until the moisture runs.
And this is the form of the scalpel.
If then there is more moisture and the hematoma is larger, then place them two splits, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone and you see the sign of it, that you see the commissures of the head open from all parts: and when you squeeze it with your hand towards the inside, and this is not hidden from you: then you should find in the middle of the head three splits, according to this way.
And after cutting remove all moisture. Then tighten the splits with rags and powder. Then dip it in wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the ligaments, and care for the tendon with linen cloth, and anoints.
And do not stop tightening the head with equality. And feed the sick with dry food and little moisture until their member is comforted and healed.
And another way of cutting is so that you consider where the hematoma appears large and the collection of water.
Since when there is more in the back or at the top or on the right or on the left.
So ascend with the cutting where it appears to you that the hematoma and the filling of water: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe so that you do not hit the artery, and it happens to be a flow of blood, and the sick dies from that flow with an evaporation of moisture.
Of the incisions of arteries that are behind the ears.
Head 2.
When it happens to anyone that there is a discharge to the eyes or to the chest and this does not bring about a cure with medicines: then more effective treatment is on him, cutting of these two arteries.
So you should when you want to cut them, that the sick person shakes his head. Then fear the place with rough cloth so that the arteries appear. Then the patient tied his own shirt around his neck with a knot. Then consider where the pulse is beating. And the places are the same as those that are behind the ears depressed: and rarely is hidden, unless in some people.
Then signs with caustic on both: and cut each one with a hammer sharp on both sides the incision approaching to the mouth: and let it be done in the width of the head.
And if you wish, introduce the chisel under the artery, and cut it towards the top with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be almost two fingers joined together.
For when the pulse is incised, blood flows out with the pulse, which rises to the inside at a frequent jump.
But if the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that measurements are taken from the hair quantity of three fingers space. Then signs with caustic, and find all the way up to the mouth.
And what is necessary to be emitted from blood, is six minutes, and perhaps you emit from it more or less. All this is according to the quantity that appears to you from the vein and filling of the artery.
Then consider towards the neck. Then if there is anything left out of the mouth of a spoon, then cut it so that it does not happen an abscess hot: and then tighten the neck with a knot of linen cloth.
Then care for himself with ointment, until he is healed.
Regarding the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Head
When it happens to a man of old headache, or of acute catarrh by reason of the moisture acrid and heat in the lacertis of the temples, or of old soda, vehemens, and similar to them: then we treat with methods of medical treatment, and do not give it: then we are expert in these ailments the extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have told.
And the mode of operation in extracting them, is, as the sickly hair that is in the temples, is shaved off, and is extended to the apparent artery in the time. And it itself is shown you from its pulse, and rarely hidden except in a few men, or by a great shivering of cold.
That if it is hidden from you, then the sick person should tie his head with any cloth: and then the place of shivering with a rough cloth. Or heat the place with warm water until it appears to you in a manifest appearance. Then take a stick that is slightly bent. Then skin the flesh with it easily until you reach an artery. Then throw in it a hook, and extract it upwards, until you extract it out of the skin, and make it ooze with tunics that are under it from all parts.
But if the artery is thin: then wrap it up with the hook's end. Then cut off from it a part according to how long its ends are stretched and stretched, and not causing a flow of blood. For if it is not cut off, and if it is not extracted, the blood does not rise deeply.
Then make the blood flow out with six ounces of water up to III.
For if the artery is large: then it should be tied up at two places with a double thread, strong, from silk: or with a hame of horsehair, so that it does not happen to putrefaction before consolidation of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then cut off the superfluity, which is between the two ligaments. Make it in that hour, or after another hour.
And if there is a wound, cauterize it with the cautery up to the nose, with the metal cautery: until its ends are cut off, and it stands in place of that work.
And it is a better work, unless the sick person has a fever, or is a person with a cald face. For the cautery is of those which remain to finish the moistures. Therefore it is better to bind up.
And after the extraction of the arteries, that it may be filled with the old cooked one: and let they be placed upon the wound from without made.
And after the solution of the poultice with dry medicines, which make the flesh to grow, and with liniments, until it is healed.
That if, while you are operating, a flow of blood comes from the artery, then proceed to cut it off with the cautery, or fill the place with pitch: and press your hand, until the blood is cut off. That if you have nothing present to do so, then put your finger upon the place, until the blood is frozen. And moisten the place with water of coldness, until the smarting ceases, and press according to what is necessary.
And from that which is softer and easier to extract the artery, it is, as if the sharp edge of a knife with this cautery having two blades: and the sharpness of the two blades is like an almond. However, they are much less sharp in sharpness than the two blades. Since if they are acute, as the two blades, it is fitting that both have coldness: and do not strike the flesh with velocity. But when there is a little roughness in them, it is held in them the heat of fire, and the flesh is cut off quickly: so that with this work it is better, lighter, and easier.
And this is the form of the cautery.
And be a space which is the quantity of the roughness of the finger between the two blades after you have marked the two places with fire: and place the two bright ones, until they come to the tip, and strike only at the two places: so that it may grow longer what is between the extremities of it. Since they do not consolidate with this cautery.
Chapter IV. On the treatment of acute and chronic eye diseases.
On the treatment of acute and chronic eye diseases.
If the tears are persistent and the eyes are sore, and the hair on the outer part of the head is breaking off, and there is no benefit from medical treatment; and his eyes become red, and his forehead feels like it is walking like ants, and his eyelids are swollen with tears: then the ancient people used to treat them with this operation, and called it Ense.
And it is as you command to shave off the hair on the forehead of the sick person. Then make three cuts in the forehead at equal distances along its length; and let the length of each cut be almost like two fingers, and one cut be at an equal distance from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second be according to the length of the jaw, and the third be from the edge of the other: and take care not to cut the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space between each cut be the length of three joined fingers: and take a sponge fragment prepared, or many dried sheets, with which to dry up the blood.
Then insert a sharp tool made of two acute points, whose shape is as follows: and immediately after it is: From the incision that is from the temporal side, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two cuts, with soap, which is on top of the bone. Then also make this from the middle incision to the second incision. Then remove this knife and insert into the first incision another tool, which is called an acute chisel, made of soft wood on one side, not acute on the other: And this is its shape:
And place its acute side towards the flesh attached with skin, and its soft side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle cut: and sever with it all the tools that descend from the head to the eyes: except that it continues the incision up to the point where the skin appears.
Then make that incision from the middle notch all the way to another notch.
And after a quantity of blood has drained that is equal to the amount of blood that has accumulated, squeeze out the place from which the clot of blood has come.
Then put a strip of lint over the whole wound, and place on top of them cotton balls soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar. And bind so that there is no heat scab.
And on the third day dissolve the strips, and administer a strong infusion with warm water. Then care for that with basilicum ointment, and with the others which are used to cure wounds: until it is healed.
Head V.
[On the treatment of acute tears and cataracts in the eyes from within the head.]
When acute, bitter, and persistent cataracts occur in someone's eyes, and their eyes seem weakened, with inflamed eyelids and hair falling out from them, and there is a sharp pain at the base of the skull, followed by subsequent sneezing: then remove these accidents, as those materials do not come unless they are removed with many medicines.
And the best treatment for them is this. And it is as you command to remove the sick person's forehead. Then make an incision in that one notch in the middle of the forehead, or a little bit more than halfway across from one side to the other: and begin the cut from the left side of the nose to the right side: and extend the cut all the way down to the mouth: and lengthen your hand away from the jawbones, which move during mastication: until it is stopped by the mouth: and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with dried lint or strips of linen. Then tie it tightly from above with cotton balls: and soak the cotton balls in wine and oil so that there is no heat scab.
And when you dissolve that, and you will see that the heat scab is about to form: then it is necessary that you stop up the nose, until it begins to form a baby nose.
Then take care of himself with the dry regime which makes him give birth to flesh: as if you took two parts from wheat flour and four parts from colophony, and prepared from them an ointment, and administered it for the birth of flesh in these wounds.
Chapter VI.
The cure for him who falls into gold:
All that falls into gold is of four kinds: or a mineral rock, or something similar to it, such as iron, and an effleurage; or it is from a plant, such as beans, and peas; or it is a fluid thing, such as water, and vinegar, and things like them; or some animal.
And when a rock falls into gold, or a kind of rock that does not add to it, or does not grow in gold, expose the gold to the sun: but if you see a rock, then distill in gold some of the oil of sesame, or of mustard seed. Then administer the extraction, and make it snuff up with condiments, and paint the nostrils at the approach of sniffing, after you have placed in the vicinity of gold swaths made of cloth, or wool, and spread the gold towards the top.
For this cure is to be repeated many times.
But if it does not leave [the gold], then administer the extraction with gentle gestures, that is, with subtle pizgaroli: whose form is this.
But if it leaves [the gold] with gentle gestures, it is good.
And if not, then administer the extraction with a subtle blind hook, made of few doublings.
But if it does not leave  [the gold] with this, then make a tube of brass, and insert the end of the tube in the hole of the ear much, and paint that which is around the tube with soft brass with oil, so that there be no passage for wind except through the tube: and then extract with your strong attraction.
For this cure is to be repeated many times. But if it does not leave  [the gold] in this way: then take from the hen-egg or from the water, that is, prepared gluten, with which the birds are caught; and place it at the tip of the ear after you have dried it slightly with a cotton ball: and then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, after you have taken off the gold from the ear by drying it.
If therefore he does not go out with all that we have related, then proceed to split it open, before the hot abcess or spasm occurs.
And the mode of the incision is such, that the phlebotomist takes it from the back of the head first: and he draws out the blood therefrom according to the measure of his usefulness. Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards the top, and find the hole at the base of his ear next to his fat in a depressed place: and let the hole be round in shape, until you reach the stone; then take it out with it, which is possible for you with your instruments.
Then sue the incision from now on with speed, and attend to it, until it heals.
That if what falls into the ear is from one grain, which grows and swells: then administer extraction of it.
If it does not submit to you for exit, then take a thin, delicate speculum according to this shape.
And administer with it the incision of its speculum from one grain that falls into the ear, and do not consider when you think that this grain has already become moist because of the vapor of the ear, until you put it on many whips: then remove it with a hook, or with a subtle gesture, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it is soothing.
In water, however, which is put into the ear, let it be used by the sick with sneezing when he is first dressed: and already it fills his ear with some cooked old stuff: and he lies on that ear where there is water. If then he goes out through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many small stones according to the length of a finger, soft, dull, and warm them with fire for a little while, and let the sick person put one of them into his ear: and let it come out at the bottom part from his foot, and hit against another stone on the ear. Therefore cease not doing that with stones and stone-cutting, until he goeth out all entirely in water.
And also goeth out the water so, that thou mayest take from the wood, or from the vine, and putteth the extremitas one of it in the aurum: and lightest the extremitas other with fire, until it is very much burnt. Then repeat the jingling another time, and do so many times as is said above in the stone: and draw it out with a tube according as was said above in the wood.
In extraction also of animals in it, if it is a small body as a mouse, and such like, take care of it as I said in division.
But if it is a body of great size, which appears to the sense: then administer the extraction of it with gestures and hooks: and the thing is easier for all those that hold on to the ear.
In extraction also of a child in the ear, when you take care of it with that which we have said in division, and in the treatise on distillation, and your cure does not avail: then thou mustest look in the ear towards the sun. But if it seems there anything of the vermes, then draw it out with a gesture, or with a subtle hook.
But if nothing seems there: then take a tube, which has this form, narrow below, wide above: and put the end of it into the ear according to that quantity which the weak can bear: and then suck with it a strong suction. Do so many times as is said above, until all the vermes go out.
But if they do not obey thee to the exit: then load around the tube with ceruse, as I said above in the stone.
That if they do not go out with that which we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancient ones did know in the infection of the vermes: and thou shalt find it in the treatise on distillation.
And let your oil and medicines flow out with this instrument when you hold it thus, whose form is depicted here. As you see the face made of silver or bronze, lower part stricted, in which sit small hole, wide upper.
So sit as if you push what is in the concavity of the tube, sit from bronze made askew. And if you wish, take the ray, and spin it in the end of it by gentle spinning: then pour oil, or juice, or what you wish from these medicines into the tube: and let it sit in the ear: then introduce the ray with the cotton wet, and squeeze it with your hand gently, until it shoots out the oil in the cavity, and feels warm inside: and let not be that which is distilled into it cold too much: for these medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter VII.
On the treatment of an ear infection with silver.
When some children come out from their mothers' wombs not pierced.
And it has also happened and to some men an ear infection with silver, or flesh born in it.
And this infection when it forms in the deep cavity of the ear, which does not follow washing: and when it happens to the external cavity a little, and follows washing.
That therefore which happens in the deep ear, and which does not understand aspect, is in many dispositions difficult to cure.
And in that which follows washing, it is necessary that you put silver Nurse on the sun, and watch in it: then if you see an infection appearing, open it with a sharp spatula, of which form is this one following, sit the end where sits some little width, whose some part sits acute: and the other spatumile sit of two sides soft: so that does not hurt the ear.
If then an infection is from flesh born in the ear: then hold it with a small hook, and cut it with ease gentle, until all flesh is taken away.
If there is a swelling in the deep part of the ear: then take a thin ray, wood, and heat it slightly with fire: then send it into the meatus of the ear.
If you feel a swelling with it, that which is associated with a loss of hearing with weight: try to ease it with ease: and beware, do not injure the nerves of the ear.
Then put a drop of liquid into the ear according to the amount of the width of the foramen, which you have introduced with Egyptian ointment: leave it for a few days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Or take a drop and put it into water that has been rose-colored, and dust it over the ear with finely ground powder, and use it.
If you see the ear already opening: then it is necessary that you should take a drop of liquid and send it out with another drop, which you have introduced into a green thing that is made with rose-colored oil, until it stops being hot: then take care of the ear until it is healed.
If, however, there is a flow of blood: then dip a sponge or cloth into cold water and put it on the ear: and use the remaining cure, which stops the predicted flow of blood in the treatment of distillation.
The cure of Azelai of the eyelids.
Chapter VIII.
This is Althelai's treatment for eyelids that are either moist or dry.
It is necessary that you should hold them with nails: or with a pin, and pound them with the roots of herbs. Then put finely ground powder on the places.
If, however, blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens cautery.
And cauterize them, it is better after the incision. For many times they return when they remain with some of their roots. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Regarding the treatment of eyelids of the eyes.
Chapters on the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases and injuries.
There are times when a substance accumulates in the eyelids, which is firm and resilient, and for this reason it is called Grandini, and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper lid, and in the lower lid.
Therefore, when it comes to these eyelids, you should know that if the Grandini is coming from the eyelid, which appears on the eye, and moves to all parts, and the thing is easy to do.
So then find over it a slit in width. Then scrape it off from all parts with ease until it is clean. Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
But if you are not prepared to cut it off, unless you penetrate the eyelid with a slight incision, then it will hurt the eye in some way.
If the slit is large: then aggregate it with a stitch: and take care of it, until it heals.
And if it is small, do not cause harm from it. Because the ointment restores it and makes it infected.
And if the Grandini falls inside the ear toward the inner surface, then invert the eyelid and hang the Grandini with a hook: apart from that, you will cut it off, and press it on all sides.
If the eyelid is stretched by the incision, then it does not hurt in any way.
Then cleanse the eye after the incision of Grandini with salty water: and take care of the place with it that is infected, until it heals.
Chapter on the treatment of eyelids.
Head 10.
Axirnath is a substance that grows on the eyelids: and it often happens to boys; and it causes their eyes to water, and they cannot see the sunlight, because tears flow toward them, and therefore they lie on their faces all the time, and they sleep on their faces, and their eyelids are always moist with inflammation, which has now been caused by an inflation: and the prominence of Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And the mode of his operation is that he should put the sick person's head in your lap.
Then take a sheet of linen and prepare it with strings, and make a loop from it according to the quantity that contains the axernath from all sides. Then place him on it and press with your fingers from all sides so that the axernath is gathered together in the middle of the loop.
Then find in the middle of his head with a wet finger incident to the crack from side to side, and there is not a larger crack that is made in phlebotomy in the depth.
Or it should be that you find all the skin, until you reach the axernath, for in many positions the axernath proceeds from the crack according to the form of the white layer being frustrated.
Therefore take it out with the cloth that you have soaked between your fingers on the outside: and you will turn your hand to the right and to the left until it is scattered: and carefully, so as not to add to the crack, so that you do not come with a finger to the eye, and let it go.
If, however, the axernath does not appear to you at first in the crack, you should add to the crack a little with ease, until the axernath proceeds. Then take it out, as we have said.
Then dip the cloth in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and squeeze him with dust.
And there are people who sprinkle salt, and put it in the crack, that the remaining moisture from it may become liquid.
Then take care of it, until it is healed.
If, however, there happens to be a hot swollen place, then take care of it with poultices of cold, until it is healed.
As for the modes of operation of the eye, that is, when the eyelids are soft to the eye, since it causes them to twitch as if they were not soft.
Chapter XI.
When hairs grow out in the eyelids beyond their natural course, and grow backward: then they hurt the eye, and cause various diseases, such as constant tears, moisture of the eyelids, and white spots, until this causes destruction of the eye.
And Ataxmir also cures the eye according to four ways. Or with a cauldron and fire. Or with sharp medicine, according to what is premised in the chapter on cautery. Or Ataxmir cures by incising and suturing. Or with tubes, as I call it.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap. Then turn the patient's eyelid with your left hand.
If it is turned, it is good. And if not: enter it with a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and cause it to penetrate with a thread upward, and let it be near the hair itself, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upward with the lid, and turn it outward with the point.
Then find on the inner side of the eyelid beneath the hairs added with a knife coming from the greater tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small piece of wool from wool, or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with caustics, which are like a fig leaf.
However, it is necessary that the figure be varied in quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this varies among men.
From them one is who does not wish to be turned from the eyelid a great deal, according to the quantity which softens from the lid.
Then find with the knife on the two lines that you marked, and begin from the greater tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let there be one slit near the natural hairs, as is the girth of a radius.
Then introduce an awl in two angles of the skin. Then scrape all of it. Then gather together with sutures two lips, with an awl and a thin thread: and wipe away the blood, and let that which is surplus from the hairs adhere to the two eyelids, with certain things that are invisible, if you wish to do this: and if not, I do not cure.
Then leave the stitch and thread for three days, or four: thereafter care for it.
And if there is a wound, leave the raw flesh without stitching, and care for it with that, which dries up and tightens. For the eyelid should be removed from the seal of the wound and its aggregation: but a better one will come in time.
In this way, Ataxmir taught the ancient method of caring for it.
However, in that is a trouble about the sick one, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in that.
And another mode is also with Ataxmir: and it is, as signs on the eyelid, a figure which is like a fig-leaf, as we have told.
Then wash the eyelid with three separate or gathered hooks, according to this form which follows, then cut off what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with an equality of the incision.
But if you are not able to hold the hook, and it does not fit that way: then take a thread in which is a knot, and put it in the middle of the figure: and put another thread near the tear of the eye, and a third thread near the tear of the eye less: and gather the threads between your fingers with an equality.
Then wash your hand with an equal washing: and wash the skin over which is marked the fold, as we have told.
Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a stitch: and care for it, until it is healed.
But if there happens to be a blister on your incision, or a crack: but that blister with olive oil, and these like things, from sitting in the sun.
And when ever the eyelids turn round, as they do so by their own hair.
Therefore you should use what we have said to the incision: but the stitch is more artificial. The care of Ataxmir with the hooks.
AND is, as you turn round the eyelid, and cut the crack which is within, according to this which we have told. Then make two sticks or two thin pieces of wood; their length should be according to the length of the eyelid and their width according to the lesser width of a spoon; and you have already marked out on both ends where the threads run from one side to the other.
Then collect with care on top of what hangs over the eyelid, and tightly tie together the two sticks from both sides with a strong knot, and leave it for a few days. For the skin is tight and will die and be damaged, and rot until it falls away on its own.
If then it is delayed, then cut it with a knife. Then take care of it until it is healed.
When then is consolidated, the eyelid is lifted up: and the hairs are not prickly.
And this is the form of the two sticks, which you should make according to this figure, and the quantity in length and width.
Chapter XII.
De the elevation of the prickly hairs in the eye with a needle.
The operation on it is as follows: you take a fine needle, and stick it into the eye through a fine thread. Then collect the ends of it, and tie each end with a fine knot; and make the length of the threads be a palm.
Then put another fine thread under it in an अलिंξωτάκι, and tie the ends of it with a knot if you want.
Then place the sick head in your lap, and hold it near the light so that the operation may be seen: for the operation is subtle or minute.
Then stick the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and push it quickly into the eyelid until it comes out at the edge of a natural hair.
Then draw the hair up above the Alinxotati: and stick it into the Alinxotati; if one, or two, or three, not more.
Then draw your hand away from it, until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati onto the eyelid with a natural hair.
If, however, the hair has been torn out and does not grow back: pull out the hair from below with a thread that you have put into it until it comes out through the upper opening, and pierce it with your finger: then pull out the hair and thread, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair grows back in its place, and a scar forms over it.
That if the hair is short, then either attach to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and pull it out with it; or leave it alone until it grows longer after a space, and then pull it out.
Chapter XIII: Head.
When these happen to the eye, they are called Leporina.
And these alxatratus are either natural or accidental.
So the accidental alxatratus is caused by the congestion of a wound, or a section, or a cauterization, and similar things.
And the mode of operation in it is, that you find her congestion, and that you separate its lips, and put into it what is between them, a piece of linen, and bind it, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary, that you should use in its treatment those things which dry and constrict; for if you do so, it will return worse than it was: but use in it those things which soften, such as foenugraeum; and bathe it with water, in which has been boiled althea, semen lini; and apply with it an ointment that is liquified with some of the oils; and wipe it with linen, and treat it with it.
And your treasure of healing is, that you should seek with all your ability to prevent its consolidation, according to the form which it had in the beginning.
And this operation which we have described, is no other than a certain correction of the alxatratus, so that it does not return to the form of the place entirely.
On the treatment of the upper eyelid, which is a twitching or contraction upward to the right and left.
Head XXVIII.
This of Al-Khattabi which is done below, is that which is truly called Al-Khattabi. And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental one is made by an arrow, or a scar, or a wound, and similar things.
And the way of operation in it is, that you take an arrow, in which there is a double filament, and touch it to the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the filament reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upward with an awl, and strike it with a chisel from the side. If then the form of the eyelid returns according to what is necessary, it is good.
And if not, take a radium, and put it in the groove, and turn it with it the eyelid: and find two grooves on the inner side of the eyelid, and their ends are from two angles of incision, until they meet and make the angle: until when they come together, make this figure, and it is a Greek letter.
Then remove that flesh in quantity, which is the acute lower side of it, from there where it follows the eyelid. Then gather together the separated parts: join them with sheep's wool.
Then treat them with that which we have said, of soothing medicines, and liniments, until they are healed.
And if the Al-Khattabi comes about from a groove, or縫合, or an arrow: then you must find a flat groove under the eyebrows, also according to what came before. Then separate the two lips with a liniment, according to what we have said.
And the summary of the speech on the treatment of the Al-Khattabi when it is above or below, is that it pursues a certain operation, according to which it is prepared from the form of the Al-Khattabi.
For this reason, the shape itself is very diverse and the skillful artisan prepares his mind with any possible means until he restores the figure to a natural form or near it, and also becomes ill according to what is appropriate to him from operation and instruments in various positions.
De exsecatione laceratione & ligature illaquatione.
The adhesive force of the eyelid with the conjunctiva or the cornea:
When this consolidation happens to many people so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents itself from its natural operations.
Therefore, you should insert the tip of a ruler under the eyelid and raise it up: or extend it with a needle: then cut the adhesion with a very fine awl that does not have the sharpness of incision with needles, but rather is somewhat blunt: so that the sick person does not become disturbed at the operation, and removes the needle, and hurts his eye with its sharpness: and your incision is as if you were taking away its adhesion with ease, until he returns the eyelid to its natural form, and heals the entire adhesion.
Then pour into the eye salty water, with which to wash it: or distill in it from a wine-skin dissolved in water: or from zinc dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a thread: and place on the eye wool infused with wax: and after three days use oil, and with consolidations, until it heals.
The Incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears:
De exsecatione laceratione & ligature illaquatione.
You know that the nail is second in two ways. It is a nerve, and it is like a hard bone, thin. It is not a nerve, and it is like frozen moisture of white, which, when it touches metal, or iron to take hold of with a needle, is torn off, and does not form an uncinous shape.
And both kinds of wounds do not begin until the larger tear has occurred, until they are slowly discovered, until the fluid is gathered, and the light and movement of the eye are blocked.
And his method of operation in this incision is: that he may lay his head in your lap. Then open his eyes and wipe his eyelids with your hand. Then take a fingernail with a little tweezers and extend it towards the top. Then take a pin from the horse's hair, or a hook, or a needle: and make the thread strong, and double its end a little, and fix it in the center of the nail: and pierce it with the pin, and tie it with a nail-thread, and extend it towards the top: and scrape it with the hair on the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with the hair until the end of the nail.
Then cut off the residue at the base of the eyelid with a sharp scalpel, or a pair of tiny scissors: and let go of the natural lid tissue so that the course of tears does not continue to flow.
And when the nail is extended with just a fingernail: or with a thread, as we have said. Then scrape it with a soft scalpel, whose shape is this.
And be careful so that the scalpel does not scratch the horny tunic, and do not cause a tear in it, and do not pierce the pupil.
Then after the incision, pour a little crushed salt into the eye, or make a paste from zinc, and let it rest until another day. Then care for the eye with whatever is necessary, until it heals.
If the nail is not sensate, and you cannot insert an acorn into it, and there is no hold for a hook: then very often care this kind of nail with medicines, and it heals as well as tells in division.
If you are to incision the vein, then open the eye with care, and take a very sharp scalpel, gentle in sharpness, such as this form. And trim the nail from above with precision. That if you see that it itself is thinned and dried up, and impressed with the cut, then distil from your hour in the eye made from sieves made of linen, or from red sieves, or from ground salt: and polish the eyes until the next day.
Then repeat the operation on it again until all of it is removed. Unless you find that a hot pussylike eye is against you: for then let go of it, and take care of the pussy until it is healed.
Then repeat the operation on the same thing with precision until it is healed.
Except that the flesh of the eyelids, if it hurts in the eye with great pain, is suspended with a hook, and is cut from that part of it: and do not make the last cut, lest the course of the tears run away.
Then distil in the eyelids a sieves made of red, or made of linen, until it is healed.
Regarding the incisions of Al-Wa-Ward and the flesh that has grown in the eye:
Chapter XVII.
It grows when it is composed of red flesh in the eyes of some people, or placed on top of it, until it covers the pupil, or comes closer, or presses onto the eyelids, and possibly turns the eyelids outward: and it disappears from under the eyebrows.
And the operation on it is also that he who has a sick head puts it in your lap. Then open his eyes, and pick up all the flesh with a suitable hook: and hold it with one forceps, or grasp it.
Then cut into the flesh first, until all of it is finished with the incision tool. And keep the eye away from you during the operation: and let your incision be such that it does not touch the eye, or with a small chisel, which we have mentioned in the cutting of the nail: or with small forceps, according to which the shape of the flesh will come out after this chapter.
When your incision is thus completed, and the whole algardenici has been moved away, then fill the eye with salt crushed: or distill into it red powder, and similar things from the corrupted medicines: and place over the eye a cottum with albugine: so that it is secured from heat of apostasis.
That if anything remains of the algardenici, and a warm blood dominates you, and you time for the heat to subside: then discharge the eye, and take care for it with what soothes while the heat subsides.
Then repeat over the site with the operation, until it is healed.
And likewise do likewise with the flesh added which happens to the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary that the healing of any weak eye from its natural way or from an accident be carried out with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you have fallen asleep, for that member is tolerant of that operation.
Regarding the removal of sebaceous matter from the eye.
Chapter 18: The head.
There are red sebaceous matter which cover the eye, and prevent its operation: and they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Therefore it is necessary that you first, if the eye in which is Sebel is strong, and there is no other illness in it but Sebel: then collect Sebel from it.
And it is, as you order the sick person to put his head in your lap.
Then hang those red sebaceous matter with a hook one, or two, according to your caution: and may the hook be thin, according to this form, or may there be two hooks separated in the body one, according to this form.
Then take with subtle hooks those red sebaceous matter with subtlety, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until they have fallen out of the eye, and are resolved: and do not leave the eye with the edges of a spatula.
And let your operation be in the south [direction] before the sun, and be firm in your operation, sharp [in your effort]. So that you do not fall except those [fingers] nails.
And when you have finished [the operation], then sprinkle on the wound with white of egg, or red wine: so that its sharpness may corrode what remains of the scar.
But if you are not able to gather all of it in that hour, then bandage the eye with that, which soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days, until the pain subsides: and protect it from the hot breeze: and then repeat over it the same way again, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scalpel.
(De) Reduction (of) Arsy (to the nose).
Chapter XIX.
Nam videres, ut superius nasum adspicere possint, et illi qui extenui illaque faciunt, ut sint in operando, cum illis cuiusaus et pilis et iustis. Et si illius est suppletio, nonne et hae sunt?
And if it is not healed then there is no skill in it: unless you discover the skin-depth at its birth, and scrape out all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone is detected.
So when the bone is detected, and you see corruption or blackening in it, then shave it with an instrument, the form of which is as follows.
And it is called the Aspery scalpels.
Let it be made of iron, and let its head be round like an azir, that it may be dotted with the edge of a file, or with the dotting of a small awl: and place it on the site of the corruption of the bone.
Then move it between your fingers, and press your hand gently, until you know that that corruption is now shaved: and do it a few times.
Then restore the place with dried-out stimulants of strychnine.
But if the place is consolidated, and bone is born in it, and the course of blood is cut off: and remains for forty days, and does not renew itself, and does not ooze, and does not happen to it any accident: then you shall know that it has been healed.
And if not, then there is no skill in it, unless he reduces the tube to the nostril, according to this form.
And is, that you discover the second bone with iron, or with acute medicine: and when it has been discovered, then seize the second terbum, according to this form, its end being iron, triangular; and its wood being a pyramid extended up to the extreme end, as you see.
Then put that on top of the bone itself: and let it be near the lacrimal: and extend your hand from the eye a little. Then rotate your hand with the terubrum, until it penetrates the bone and feels weak: by this you will see that a sensitiveness is leaving it as it holds its hand over its nose.
Therefore at that time restore the place with stinging medicines, as I have taught you.
When the flesh has then grown up, and the place has hardened: at that time the substance which flowed to the outside returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter on the weak.
De reductione eminentiae oculi.
Chapter XX - On the reduction of a prominent eye.
When the eye protrudes with its entirety, and does not happen to damage the vision or decrease it: then you should open the eyelid: then you should bleed it: then you should put ventosas on the skin without scarring, but with suction.
Then put over the eye a lotion that is made of acacia, and aloe, and olive oil, and sarcocolla. Then tighten the eye from above over the plaster with various powders.
And the mode of the powders is: that you take soft cloths, many, and double all the cloths out of them four: make from them many: then put them one on top of the other, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then tighten them over each other with a hard cloth, stricture strong.
And again put ventosas on without scarring.
Then remove the ventosas, and let go of the tightened eye day and night.
If however the ligament is again softened, then it should be tightly bound: afterwards remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said.
If however you see that the eye has healed and the wound of the cornea is good, this is good: and if not, then put on again ointment and dust and bind it tightly, and moisten it with a moistening, until it heals.
§ On the Incision of the Tunica.
CHAPTER XXII.
When a rupture occurs in the tunic of the eye, then it should be cut and removed from outside the eyelids as far as a grain of wheat, and fed with a tool in order that it may be incised: then the operation in it is according to what you can put into the root of the eye from below to above.
Then introduce another acumen, which is a double thread from the lacrimal side, and cause it to penetrate: and then let go of the first one according to its position.
Then incise the place where the double thread is, and tie that end of the eye with a thread around it: and tighten it well.
Then extract it again, and place on the eye wool infused with albumen of the eye: and then let go of it until the thread falls with the eye.
Then take care of the eye with that, which comforts it, until the scar heals.
And when the eye is tied up on all sides with a circle of cloth, until it adds a great prominence to the eye.
Then it is to be pierced with a fine awl, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and moistened with albumen, and the eye drops and enters immediately: then tie it up, until it heals.
§ On the Treatment of Alcmaeon.
CHAPTER XXII.
This illness called Alcmaeon's, is not anything but a kind of moisture that is gathered in the eye, similar to water dropping down, and it is not itself.
And the mode of operation in it is, that you should make the sick sit on a prepared chair, or straight.
Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you can see his eyes below. Then fix him, and let it not fall, and let the light be complete: and let the sick person see as he saw: and if it does not go down below, know that it is water.
If, however, the descent is not prepared with him as we said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a thin spatula, and find with it above the cornified tissue somewhat at the intersection with the corneal layer on the crown, until the substance comes out.
When it has come out, then distil into the eye hot water in which you mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled foenugreek and honey: then let it be cared for with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
As for the care of the water that entered the eye, or a cascade.
Head 23.
We have already spoken about the kind of water, explaining and showing what it is suited for, then take that same one according to the health.
Then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands square-wise, opposite to the light, near the sun: and tie his healthy eye, and tighten it tightly: then, with your right hand, paw the eyelid of his eye from which the water comes out, if the eye is on the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Then take with your right-hand almond, if the eye is on the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Then put the end of the almond close to the crown by the thickness of the radius in the white of the eye apparent tear: then push the almond with force: and you rub it with your hand, until it enters into the eyelid: and you will feel that the almond has already come to the moist part.
And it is fitting that there be a measurement of the road from the edge of the pupil to the end of the ring of blackness: and this is the cornea of the eye. You will see it in itself in the pupil of the eye with its clarity of the cornea.
Then put the magnet until the place where is water. Then press it itself downward with one stroke after another.
But if the water has descended at once, then immediately it sees that thing which opens its sight at once, and the magnet in its eye.
Then you rest a little. But if the water has descended, then put it down again, except that it should go out.
When it is set, and does not rise up: then pull out the magnet with ease: and you raise your hand little by little.
Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt of the jewel: and wash with it the inner part of the eye. Then put outside all the eye a paste, or wool infused with oil and waxed, and ties it up with it a healthy eye.
But we, and those who are our time, put on it minced thyme with milk-wax.
That if the magnet does not obey you at the entrance to the eye because of its hardness, since it is from men, whose eye is very hard: then you should take a blade, which is called Alberid, whose form is as follows.
Then open it with him only at the joint, and not at the end of your hand: and is there not except that you should make a hole for the magnet to the soft place.
Then put in the magnet, according to what we have said.
And near the completion of your work, prepare for the infirm man a dark bedroom in which he should sleep on his back in a dark house: and prohibit him from all movements, and from coughing: and put before him food which suits his nature: and let him not move his head to the right or to the left at all.
And let the second ligament be placed according to its position until the third day.
Then dissolve that in that dark house, and test its effect; and make it look at things. Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary for him to make that during the time of cure, or immediately after the incision: but he should keep it away: for water rises quickly through a whetstone surface.
But if it happens that there is a fever: then you should dissolve the eye before the seventh day: and straighten it with him when the scar heals, until it heals: then absolve his vision, and place it on his mouth where his vision lies under him for a few days, while he remains in that dark house.
Then let him leave the house gradually, and walk about in his rooms.
And know that the student is not spared from vision sometimes in the chamber: then let him listen to the operation.
And indeed some of them have come to us who are from Al-Arab, who said that it was done in Al-Arab by a piercing gold wire, which suctions water.
But verily we have not seen anyone in the land who has done that; nor is it written in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the eyes, so that they stand on top of him who does not know them.
Let them be made of pure bronze; and let their ends be with this same subtle triangular shape, and the acute end.
Chapter 24.
Regarding the cure for a born-with-a-sore nose.
When and how different meats are added to it, some of which are absorbed by the many-legged scorpion; and from that is a kind of flesh that is scaly, pale-colored, and soft: and from that is the meat that is dull, not pale-colored.
In the places where these muscles are soft, not fraudulent, and not cancerous, you should make the sick person sit with their hands facing away from the sun, and open their nostrils, and insert hooks into those muscles: then pull them outward, and cut what you have grasped with a fine, sharp scalpel from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
If anything remains of it for which it is not possible to cut off: then with one of the instruments with a small blade you can easily remove all of it until nothing remains. But if blood is in your power, or there is a warm hematoma: then oppose it as needed: or if it is a malignant hematoma, then approach it with cauterizing, until the blood stops flowing, and all the flesh is removed.
Then a bit of vinegar should be applied to the nose after the cut, and water or wine. But if the nose is opened, and moist air proceeds from it until the palate: then know that he has already recovered.
But if the moisture does not penetrate, as it should, then know that within the upper bones of the nose, where the flesh has not been cut with the instrument.
Then you should insert a thread of linen whose thickness is appropriate, and many knots in it: and place a quantity of a finger or less between each knot: and the sick person will let go of one end of the thread into the nose with a beam, or with whatever is possible for him to do after he has made himself similar to an azore: and he should pull on his own odorant until it reaches his palate, and come out through his throat.
And many times these young men make this device similar to an azore at school: and it is a simple thing for him who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread, the end that comes out above the nose, and the other that remains inside the nose. Then, the surgical instrument for locking the flesh with knots that are on the thread. Then, make it so you know that the flesh is already with the knots on the thread.
Then remove the thread: and put into the nose after the withdrawal of blood, the liquid that you have soaked up in the Egyptian ointment: make it so for three days, or more, until the ointment has eaten away all that is left of the flesh.
Then put into the tip of the thing in the nose a plumbum cannula, days several, until it heals.
If however if the cure does not meet what dries up, use that one.
For the cleaning of the head, when it is poured out oil, and other medicines into the nose, make it out of silver, or brass: that it is similar to a small lamp, opened like a shell: and its edge also.
And if you want to make the cannula closed, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for making the head clean, is full, detected: which has a handle at the back of it, which you hold when you heat it in the oil, or what you want to extract, and fluid things.
Head 25.
The ulcer of the nose often develops in the extreme tip of the nose and increases in size over several days until it reaches a certain limit of appearance.
And for this reason, when you first see it, you must scrape off all of its surface. Then put on the place, or a causticum, or a medicine that burns in the place.
If however the incision lags behind its appearance, until it increases, then consider, if it is stone, hard, bright in color, few senses: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous ulcer.
For often the same eye, which has cut the nose of the patient, and has happened from it a great evil on the part of him who had it.
If the apostema is mild, without a change in color, and you see that an incision can be made throughout its entire length, then wash the area with water and make the incision without fear or trepidation. Care for the wound with the same care as you would for a dry crust, until it heals over.
Chapter 26: The Head.
Regarding the suture of the nose, lips, and ears.
You should know that when a rupture occurs in the continuous line of one of these cartilage structures, surgery is not very effective in some people.
Therefore, when this has occurred in someone, you should know that if it is a recent wound with its own blood, and you join the pain of the wound to the suture, then care for the wound itself until it heals.
If the continuous line of the lips has already separated, and each side has become its own distinct part: then you should cut away all the skin on the surface, until it bleeds. Then join the two lips together with a suture and tighten them, and sprinkle dragon's blood powder and ground olibanum on the wound, and place a fragment of a plaster of diamond-hard material on top of the powder, and some other hardened plaster: and leave it bound for two or three days. Then loosen the suture and replace the medicine, and leave it until the threads themselves have grown apart. Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
The method for sewing is such that you gather the continuous line together, or with a needle, as we have described in the nasum suture; or you gather it with thread, as I told you.
Chapter 27: The Head.
Regarding the extraction of lumps from the lips.
Many people experience hard lumps in the inner part of their lips, which are similar to grains of grass; and some of them are small, and some are large.
Therefore you should turn the lips inside out, and locate each lump, and hang it by a hook, and cut it away from all sides.
Then fill in the place after the incision has been made dry three times until the blood is cut off.
Then soak with vinegar and treat the spot with it where the stenosis is until the wounds heal.
Head XXVIII.
There is a wound that has come from the flesh on the gum.
A lot of times there is a piece of meat that comes out on the gum, which the ancients used to call an abullus.
It should be suspended with a hook: or you should hold it with a pair of tongs, and cut it near its root, and let the blood flow or stop the bleeding.
Then put on top of the place where the flesh has been dried three times, or other styptic powders, drying agents.
If that piece of meat returns after treatment, since it often returns, then cut it again and cauterize it: for this does not return after cauterization.
Head XXIX.
The chewing of teeth with iron.
When they are gathered together on the surface of the teeth from within and from the outside, and between the gums there are sharp ridges, and sometimes they rot, and become yellow, until the corruption spreads to the gum, and the teeth are rotten because of it.
It should be that you sit the sick person between your hands, and his head in your lap, and grind the bone and the tooth where you see the nerves, and what is like sand: until there remains nothing of it, and likewise do with the blackness, the yellowing, the citroniness, and other things until they are cleaned.
If then what is removed from them from the beginning of the grinding is good, and if not, then you should grind them again on the other day, the second time, and the third time, until you have completed the last work on them that you wish to do.
And you should know that the tooth is hard to grind with different shapes and figures: second, because it is prepared for your operation: next, because the grinding tool with which the tooth is ground from the lower part is different from the grinding tool with which it is ground between teeth, according to different shapes.
And these shapes of razors are prepared with you, which you see.
Head XXX.
¶ On the extraction of pain from teeth.
It is necessary that you heal the tooth from its pain with all effort, and be hasty in eradicating it. For the tooth does not become soft when it is eradicated: for its substance is brittle: until such time as there is no excuse for the eradication of it, then you should consider to extract it, if it grows stiff, and certify with you, the đauing tooth.
For many times the pain deceives the sick, and he thinks that the pain is in the tooth and eradicates it himself: then the pain does not retreat until the tooth is eradicated that is sick.
For we have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Then, when the tooth that is sore is certified with you, then it should be made a sacrifice in the circumcision of the tooth with the spatulum, in which there is some virtue, until it has been relaxed from all parts: and then move it with your fingers, or with subtle forceps at first, until you cut it off.
Then, when the tooth has been cut off from it, then you should put good locations on it and close the head between your knees: which you have held well so that it does not move: then pull the tooth by its right line, so as not to break it.
If then it does not come out, then take some of their instruments and put it under it from all sides with ease, and try the movement of it, as you did at first.
If then the tooth is pierced or corroded: then it should be filled with cloth: and you should hold it with a small end of the forceps, so as not to break it at the time of your tightening on it with the forceps.
And you should consider that you do the scarification in the circumcision of the gums from all parts much.
And guard your strength that you do not break it, and leave a part of it, and return to the pain from the same malice that is greater in the sick one at first.
And so, do not do what the phlebotomators do, in their haste, and their boldness in eradicating it, except that they administer to it what we have described.
For indeed they often bring about great diseases in men, which are more difficult to break, and leave behind all the roots of it, or some of its parts: or extract it with certain bones of the jaw: as we have often witnessed this.
Then they wash after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
That if it should happen that a flow of blood comes from the places (for indeed it often happens) then dry out some of the wound, and fill it with it: and if not, cauterize it, if it does not bring you relief.
The shapes of the forceps are thin, so that their ends can reach far in at first, long and thick, so as not to split when they are pressed against a tooth: they are like the thick handles that you see, until when you squeeze them, they do not cut themselves and do not split: the thin ends, and they are made of iron ingot, or of twisted wire made from thin metal, straight ends: and their ends have teeth, some of which enter into certain things, and clamp down tightly, for sure.
And when the ends become as the shape of the ear opening that is called a cuckoo, and are strong clamping.
Chapter XXXI.
Of the eradication of teeth, and extraction of bones of the jaw fractures.
When after the eradication of a tooth that is broken something remains, then you should put on the place with butter for one or two days, until it softens: and then enter into it with a probe, or forceps: whose ends are shaped like the ear opening that is called a cuckoo. The shape of this forceps is as follows.
Their ends are made like a saw's tooth: or like a file.
If he therefore does not obey you at the exit with these pincers, then it is necessary that you should stop short of the root, and lift up all the flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called a small palanquin, whose form is this.
Set the end of the bone short, and make it a little thick; and let not the bone be moistened too much, lest it break.
If then the root comes out through this, it is good; and if not, you should help it out with these other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first end, in which there is some thickness.
The form of the thin end.
And with the other instruments and tools which have preceded in the description of the teeth.
Also sit the jolt with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, whose form is that of a twisted thin end, in which there is some thickness so that it does not break; and let it not be moistened too much.
And know that the instruments for teeth are many; and likewise the other instruments do not count; and the careful craftsman, by means of his own instrument, discovers the art and illness itself through its operation.
For because from the ailments there are to those for which the ancient instruments did not speak, on account of the variety of their forms.
If then the jaw is broken by the mandible, or by any other bone of the mouth, then examine on the right place with it the instrument which suits it and these pincers and forceps which I have spoken of in drawing out the root, and help with the gesture, whose form is this.
Set in it some thickness gradually so that it is held with it the jaw and does not move or shake, until it comes out; and restore the place with the medicines which are suitable for it.
But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then draw out the bone from its putrefaction, and heal the bone, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.
On the excellent locking of teeth above others.
When the teeth are prominent and do not run in their natural course, they form an obstacle, and this happens especially in women and girls, that is, those who are growing.
You should therefore consider the following. For if he has been born with a tooth that does not fit and is not locked in place, or cannot be filed: then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, which has this shape.
It is similar to a small chisel, and is made of iron, with a sharp end.
And your cut should be deep, so that it enters the tooth over a period of time, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not displace another tooth.
But if it is prominent and exposed due to its own filing: then file it with a file made of iron, whose shape is as follows.
It should be made of iron, and its handle should be small, like the point of a needle, as with an awl: with which the tooth is filed little by little over a period of time with ease, so that it does not displace any other teeth, and then smooth it down, in the end, trim it with some razor blades.
If the tooth is broken and it hurts the tongue: then it should be filed as well, until the roughness of the broken part is gone, and it is smooth: and then it should be smoothed down, and not hurt the tongue, or affect speech.
De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.
Regarding the retention of gold-filled teeth.
When there is a concussion or jolt to the front teeth from a blow, or by falling: and they cannot be held in place on it so that it does not fall off: and they have been treated with harsh medicines, and the treatment has not helped: then invent a device to hold them in place with a gold wire: because gold turns yellow, and rots after a while: but gold never changes.
And let there be a thread of average thickness in delicacy and coarseness according to the quantity that it takes between teeth.
And the shape of retention is such that you take a thread and insert it between two healthy teeth: then sew with its two ends a thread between the teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the other healthy tooth. Then repeat the texture until you reach the side from which you began: and tightly hold your hand with delicacy and wisdom, until it does not move at all: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip.
Then cut off the ends of the thread that are excessive with scissors: and collect both sides, and twist them together: and hide them between a healthy tooth and a rotten one, so that it does not hurt the tongue: and then let go so that it relaxes.
If it does not hold fast, or if it comes loose, tighten them with another thread, and let it remain with it for a long time.
This is the shape of teeth, and the form of retention of two healthy teeth and two rotten ones, as you see it.
And sometimes a tooth that has fallen out and comes back to its place, and remains as we have described, and does not do it except a skilled person, wise, and experienced.
And sometimes a piece of bone that has become loose is caught: and it takes the form of a tooth, and is placed in its place, from which it is held fast by a thread, as we have said: and remains there, and holds fast to it for a long time.
Head 32.
And this ligament that happens under the tongue, is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from an arrow that has already healed.
And the operation on it is such that it opens the mouth of the patient in his neck, and lifts up his tongue: then cut this ligament with nerve, until it is loosed from its hold on the tongue.
If there is some hardness and nodulation and it is due to the hardening of the wound, then strike it with a hook and find it by its width, until you hit the ligaments, and let the nodule be released.
And beware that there is no fracture in the depth of the flesh, and strike the artery there, and let blood flow.
Then wipe it with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Then put under the tongue a little licorium from wool, which holds the sick one all night: so that he does not harden again.
But if there is bleeding, then place on the spot three times. But if the blood injures you, then cauterize the place with a scalded cloth, which suits it: then care for it itself with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Chapter XXXV.
When there is an pustule under the tongue that absorbs little ulcers, it prevents the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it becomes so large, until it fills the mouth.
And the operation in it is, that you open the mouth against the sun: and consider the pustule.
But if you see that it is of a dark or black color, and hard, to which the sick person does not have feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it falls off toward whiteness, and is moist: then strike into it with a hook, and cut it with a very sharp knife, and free it from all parts. If the blood injures you during your operation, then place on the spot three times, until the blood is stopped: and then return to your operation, until you take out the core with its complement.
Then wipe it with vinegar and salt: and care for it itself with the rest of the cure that suits it, until it heals.
The cure of ulcers in the two amygdalar glands.
Chapter XXXVI.
When there occur between the throat and the pharynx, that is to say, the glandular tissue which resembles angina, and occurs by itself: and they are called the two Amygdales: when you consider them with regard to the curative measures which we have mentioned in the division of the disease, and they do not heal, then pay attention.
If, however, there is a pus-like swelling, of pale colour, of little odour: then you must not touch the affected part with iron.
And if its colour is red, and its root is thick: then you must not touch the affected part with iron, fearing that there will be a flow of blood, but put it aside until it has healed. And then you shall either pierce it: or let it burst by itself.
And if its colour is white, rounded, and its root is thin: then the affected part should be sliced off.
And the operation upon it is, that you consider before the operation whether the swelling of its skin is warm and has recovered its health entirely, or is slightly shrinking: then do this, let the sick person sit in front of the sun, and have his head resting on your lap: and open his mouth, and take his tongue between your hands, and press it with a tool whose shape is as follows.
Let it be made of silver, or of brass, so that it is fine like a knife.
When you press it with the instrument and a swelling appears on your face, and this gives pain: then take a hook, and fix it to the amygdala, and draw it out as far as you can, taking care to tug at it with the skin.
Then cut it with the instrument whose shape is as follows. It is joined to the ears, and their tips are rounded; and it should be made of iron or of lead imbibed with oil.
If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a chisel whose shape is as follows. Sit acuto ab uno parte, non acuto ad alteram partem.
And when you strike one side of the jaw, strike the other side according to the same incision pattern.
Then, after the incision, rinse the sick with cold water or with vinegar and water.
But if he has a bleeding, rinse him with water in which bark of the mirtil has been boiled: or leaves of the same kind from astringent herbs, until the blood flow stops: then care for him, until he heals.
And when phlegmons arise in the throat, one besides the two amygdals. Then incise them as I have described for the incision of the two amygdals, evenly.
And I have already healed a woman from an abcess that had formed between her throat, which she choked on, and it was almost closed her throat; and this woman breathed through my throat, and she was forbidden to eat or drink, and she was coming close to death if it were left another day, or two days.
And the abcess rose only as far as two branches, until they had come out of two holes in the nose.
So I hurried and fixed one of my hooks. Then I pulled him out, and a large portion came with him.
Then I washed it off where it was caught in the hole of the nose.
Then I did the same for him when he came out of the other hole of the nose.
Then I opened her mouth and pressed on her tongue; then I fixed the hook in the abcess; then I washed it out with a part of it, and there was only a little blood; so absolutely I healed her throat, and she began to drink water right away, and then she ate food.
So I did not cease to cut off that abcess after a long time: and the abcess succeeded in place of the one I had cut off, until it was prolonged too much and began to hurt her.
I therefore cauterized and removed the apoplexy between the throat.
So he remained stationary in terms of movement: afterward, he walked away from her on one side, and I did not know what God did to her after me.
On the Incision of Apoplexy in a Patient.
Chapter XXXVII. On the Incision of Apoplexy in a Patient.
When the catarrh has descended to the uvula and has caused a apoplexy, and it is long: then that one is called the perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then that one is called a uvula.
When the treatment is performed with him that we have spoken of in the division, and there is no benefit to the treatment: and you will see that the apoplexy has become cool from her, and it is thin: then it should be cut.
And what is collected from her is round and not long, and it is bloody or dark in color, or black, and it has no feeling: then it should be cut. For fear is in the patient.
Then when you see her according to the method that I have spoken of from whiteness, and her length, so that the patient sits before the sun: and press her tongue with an instrument whose preceded description: then fix a hook in the uvula, and pull it down: and cut it with one or two instruments that I have spoken of in the incision of the two amygdales.
And you should not cut from her, unless that which is added to the natural end without addition.
For if you cut from her more than, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the incision use that which we have spoken of in the incision of the two amygdales: and take care of her, until she is healed.
If the patient shudders from the incision: then it should be used to your advantage in cauterizing her without fear and anxiety.
And the mode of cauterization for her is not, unless with sharp water: and it is, as you place her head in your lap. Then press his tongue with the instrument which we have said. Then take from the water which we told you in the chapter of cauterizing, and add to it the ashes not extinguished, and put into it the slimy matter, and fill with it this instrument whose this is the shape.
Sit the extreme of him in which the medicine is placed concauitas, like concauitas cochlearis radii.
And place the instrument with the medicine on his uvula: and the sick man lies on his side, so that the remedy comes out from his mouth by itself from within the medicine, so that nothing goes down to his throat, and he hurts himself.
Then take your hand with the medicine. And you from the first put half of it on the uvula at an hour, until you see that it is already denigrated, and sits the little by the bite of the medicine.
And if you want to take the habit, and roll him on the extreme of the radius, and put the habit with the medicine, and push the radius with the habit into the cannula from above, until it adheres the habit to the uvula.
Do this many times, until you get the result that you want of cauterization. Then release him: for it will be stiffer and falls after three or four days.
That if you want to take the medicine again, repeat it: and after cauterization wash around his mouth with a wet cloth in butter, and clean what is on it from the medicine: and let it sit in cold water.
And heal outside with embrocations, and inside with gargles, until it is healed.
This then the form of cure is healthier than cutting and less to be feared from time.
And when it is cured with the medicine which is softer than cauterization and incision: for it is cured with the smoke-inification, in this way. Take thyme, and hyssop, and oregano, and raphanus, and fennel, and chamomile, and abrotan, and other such herbs: and put them all together in a pot, or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar to it, and boil it: and sit the pot with a lid on, and put the concauing instrument over it according to this way.
Let it be made of silver, or of brass; and let the end, wherein is the granule, be inserted into the bone, until the vapour ascends to the edge over the cannula, until the hole is much darkened.
Then go back over it many times, until it has healed.
And beware that you do not make this cure in the beginning, when pus is present. For it adds to the abscess; and it should not be done except at the end of the abscess when it is cool.
If this instrument is not present with you, then take a cannula and fit it to the end of it so that the bone is not burnt; for the skin prevents the vapour from burning the bone; and this is good cure with health.
As regards the extraction of spines and bones from the groove.
Chapter LXXVIII on extracting spines and bones from a groove.
Many times a tooth, or a spine of a fish, or something else, gets stuck in the throat.
Then it should be extracted that which appears on top of the gums, after you press the tongue with an instrument against the sun, and tell me that it is in the throat.
And if it does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, then you should make a weak sick person vomit before food is digested in the stomach. Perhaps then the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or the sick person swallows a strand of numpy, or a root of lettuce, or he swallows a dry bread cracker: or he takes a dry sea sponge strand: and he ties it with a string, then he swallows it. When therefore it comes to the place where are spines or bones, and is extracted, then it goes out.
If therefore it does not go out with that which we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this shape.
Let it be larger than a radium only a little, and let the end which is to be inserted into the throat be rounded, so that it may enter with ease into the throat; and let him hold his head up.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis with his hand, lest he cough, and push with it the bone, or the spine, or thrust it himself with the doctor's hand.
But if the sick person pushes, that is better, namely because of his knowledge of the place; and he pushes from below or holds his hand with an instrument above, all this according to the quantity prepared for him, until he walks out.
(On the extraction of blood.)
(Head 39.)
(When you treat with blood-letting, as I said in the division on curing with medicines, and it does not come out, then consider whether there is a wound at the back of the throat, or whether it is by the sun after you have pressed its tongue with an instrument that I will tell you.)
(If then your cough falls on the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with subtle movements, with care.)
(If it is not possible with them: then take a closed tube and insert it into the throat as far as the back of the throat; then insert into the tube an iron bar with fire.) Do this many times: and let the sick person refrain from drinking water all day.
Then let him take a full drink of cold water, and open his mouth to it; and let him put his mouth on it, and let him not swallow anything from it; and let him move his mouth with it for an hour, by his own hand. For the leech immediately falls when it feels water.
(If it does not walk out with the leech that I have told you, then make the sick person sneeze with sniffles, or with a puff of wind with an instrument that I will tell you in sneezing.)
Do this many times, for it will fall by itself.
(And the mode of operation is this, that you take a pipe, in which are fire-tipped tubes with holes: and let the pipe be covered with a cover, with a hole; and let one end of the tube be placed in that hole.)
Then begin the process of insufflations, and place the sick person's nose at the end of the cannula, and close his nose so that the insufflation does not escape until you know that the sufflation has reached the blood-sucker. For the blood-sucker will die soon.
If it does not die, then perform the insufflations many times.
And let the sick person tolerate hunger, and eat broth, and other things, and do not drink water.
Therefore it is necessary that he leave with this treatment.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the blood-sucker is extracted from the throat when it falls on top of it while suffocating.
It is similar to forceps, as you see them: except that there is a curve that enters into the throat. And its end is similar to an ear, which is called a ciconia, in which there is a sharp edge of the blade; and when it grasps anything, it does not let go at all.
Regarding the opening of abscesses, and their sectioning, and care in general.
Head 40.
There are many kinds of abscesses, many ways of dealing with them, according to the recall of them, that is, one way, and one in this book: and they differ in the perforation of them, and in the sectioning of them from two aspects.
Of which one kind of abscess is that which is in itself, and because it comprehends from moistures.
And the second mode is on account of places, in which it occurs from the body.
For an abscess occurs in the head, it is different from an accident of abscess in the anus: and an abscess that occurs in a fleshy place is different from an accident of abscess in joints; and each has its own judgment from the operation.
And there are abscesses that do not need to be pierced, unless they have become old enough in the blood, and its completeness; and of those there are those that need to be pierced when they are raw, and do not mature according to the completeness.
As the sutures are close together.
For because the stitch becomes long when it is close to the sutures, and rotten what is in its circumference perhaps the ligaments are corroded or the nerves of that joint: so this is the cause of the greater contraction of that limb.
Or is a stitch in the main member: for if you delay the piercing of it, until it has healed, it will hurt him or through that main member.
Or is near a joint, then pierce it when immature: and do not need to pierce, the crude stitch, not fully digested, unless it is near a joint, so that it does not腐敗深層，並延长內側的解剖學，並成為一個管子，或在它的邊緣形成一個洞，它不治好。
You should know the time of piercing the stitch, which has healed according to the complement: and it is with the sedative pain, the recession of the fever, and the decrease of redness, and pulse, and sharpness of the head of the stitch: and the remaining signs.
And you should make the same piercing in the lower place of the stitches, and more prominent: and let the piercing be made by cutting along the length of the body, if the stitches are in the parts of the hand and foot, and the places of the ligaments, and nerves, and arteries, and up to the last in all equal places, which is not a reflection.
In those, however, that reflect, pierce with the piercing of that member.
But when the stitch is in fleshly places: then it is better to leave off piercing it, until it has been confirmed its digestion, as we have said according to the complement.
For if you pierce it before that member, the course of the virus will be prolonged from it, and there will be much sickness and contamination, and perhaps it will harden its lips, and its depth will grow.
And some stitches are pierced according to the length of the body when there is a necessity: or according to which member it needs.
It is fitting that you should make a small puncture in the small pustules and a large one in the large ones; or cut many sections of like size for the pustules.
And there are pustules from which the skin should be covered; and incise when it has already formed like a cloth, and has reached its term, for it is now dead: such as that which happened to many, to the swelling and the buboes.
And there are those that cut with three angles. And there is one that incises like a fig leaf.
As the pustule in the groin.
And there are those in which a round cut is made, and a lunar one; and like these are the cuts.
Indeed that which has no head, such as the small superficial pustules, should be punctured with a superficial puncture, or simply flat.
And it is fitting that when the pustule is gross and has gathered much moisture, you should pierce it so that it does not fit and throw out all the pus at once: but remove a part of it. Then cover the pustule with poultice until the next day. Then remove some of the pus again.
Do this many times according to a gradual progression until it comes out: especially if the person is weak in vigor, or a woman pregnant, or a young child at breast, or an old man decrepitous: for the spirit animal often resolves with the exit of the fluid: and perhaps the sick one dies, and you do not perceive him.
Beware therefore of this chapter.
And after your puncture, when you have pierced the pustules, you should wash with warm water: and reflect. If then there is a small wound of the pustule, or it is a flat section, then administer with linseed from flax, or old cotton. And if there is a large pustule, and the puncture holes are many, then at that time you should introduce linseed into all the cracks, until they have closed up completely.
And if you have cut off a part of the skin in an aplastic way, or have circumcised it: then you should fill it with new skin, or as when the cloth is woven together, or the down is scattered away without moisture: and bind it tightly until the third day.
Then you will cast him off, and cure that with him which needs to be done with ointment, until he is healed.
But if there should happen to be a flow of blood during your operation, then you will administer cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked up by the cloth: and lay him down on the spot of the bleedings many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you should administer the cure, and the regimens, and the powders, which are recorded in many places of our book, and from separation.
But if it is in the time of winter, and the place of the cut is many nerves: then you should fill them with wine, and hot oil: and lay them on the places.
And if it is in the summer, and the places are fleshy: then you should lay them on the powder soaked with water, and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold. Until the third day, as we have said, then you should remove the aplastic and clean him up, and administer to him which needs to be done to his cure, until he is healed.
This is therefore what is necessary from the understanding of the cure of aplastic wounds in general.
However, according to the degree of distinction, I have already said about all types of aplastic wounds, which is a way to the cure of each one separately.
Head, 51.
Regarding the section of aplastic wounds that occur on the skin of the head.
Aplastic wounds that occur on the skin of the head are small, and are of two kinds, which are nodules, which are enclosed by membranes, which are as if they were little bags of chickens.
And there are many species among them.
There are some which are thin: and there are those who retain a moisture similar to lime: and there are those who retain a moisture similar to flour and pulp: and there are similar ones, and among them are hard stones.
And in the cutting of all of them, and their extraction is not fear, when the cutting of them is not contrary to the artery.
And the operation in their cutting is as you experiment with it by instrument, whose form came after this, which is named Intramuscular, until you know what it contains.
For if that one is which contains moisture, then dry up the section after the length of the superficial section: in this form.
And begin with the section from line B to line G. And so when the moisture is emptied out, then scrape out the skin which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it intact.
Many times returns if there remains anything of it.
And then dip the cotton in ointment Egyptian, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill with it a sponge, and leave it until another day. For that stone corrodes whatever remains of the skin.
And then repeat over the cotton cotum with Egyptian oil second time, and third time, and if you tolerate that, until you are confident that there remains nothing of the skin, then indeed care for the wound with ointment, until it heals.
That if it contains a nodule that is swollen: then dry up the wound according to this form, having a cross-shaped section: and throw away the nails between the two sections, and scrape out the skin completely: and try your skill in extracting the skin which contains the stone.
But if it creates a contradiction for you, then do what I will tell you after.
And also do the same in an apoplexy, if it is a stone, from the section, and with the same cure, according to what we have said.
And the incision above the stone is easier: because there is little blood and moisture. And sometimes some of these stones are in the head of some men, where there is no humidity within.
That is: because I followed over the stone in the head of a married woman, and I found the stone like a solid and hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if it were struck by someone falling, he wounded himself.
In other, indeed, the accidents of stones in the head, except for these stones that happen in the heads of boys and at the roots of the ears, all their sections are superficial sections.
Or put a piercing through them always from their lower part, so that the course of blood may flow to the bottom.
Then take care of them with what is due to them in the curing.
On the Section on the Striae in the Neck:
Head, 42.
These stones often occur in the neck, and under the shoulders, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur throughout the body.
And over those which occur from them in the neck, there is one kind and many: and they spring from one another; and every Striae springs from within its own skin, as we have related.
And the kinds of these stones are many. For some of them are stones: and some of them contain moisture: and some of them are evil, so that they do not obey the cure.
In that one which you see is of good disposition in touch, whose color is manifestly close to the skin's color, and moves to all parts, and does not join with the nerves of the neck, nor with the guide-vessels, nor with the arteries, nor is it deep: let it be separated from its superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, c. to the line, g., and scrape it off entirely: and extend two skin lips with a hook, or with many hooks, if you can bear it, as we have said in the case of the stones in the head, and pull it out little by little.
It is necessary to take great care so that it [the wound] does not hit a vein or nerve.
And the knife should not be sharp enough to cause an opening quickly: so that it does not take your hand with an incision, or disturb the sick person, and you fall into something that is not necessary.
If you hit a vein or an artery, or if it prevents you from operating, then place the wound on a log, or some powder that stops the blood, and tighten the wound, and let it go until the sharpness passes and the wound softens: or it may begin to rot.
For the blood is stopped by the poultice. So get ready for your operation when you are finished.
Then examine with your index finger to see if there is anything left of the stigmata of the stings, and then cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the root of the stings, then you must not hit it from its root: but you should bind it with a strong twine and let it go until it falls of itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton that has already been soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then take care of the wound.
If you hit all of the stings, then you should gather the two lips of the wound together and immediately bind it up as soon as you see that there is no excess.
If you see that there is excess because of the size of the stings, then you should consider cutting off its root and pulling it out: and administer the suture that I have described.
And if any of the stings contain moisture, pierce it with a shallow puncture: so that you can see the place of maturity of it: and put the puncture away from what follows below the body, as I have said.
Then administer liniment after the puncture with ointment, and similar things so that it corrodes whatever remains of corruption, until when you see the wound has healed on its own: then take care of the wound with a gentle ointment made from flesh, until it is healed.
De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.
On the section of the epiglottis from an accident inside the throat.
The ancient ones called this section of the epiglottis, and no one in our land has seen it done, who can explain it to us; and this is the writing of their words.
In those who have a swelling, the section of the epiglottis should be removed, since it does not help in any way, because all the windpipe and lung are weak.
In those who have a hot swelling in the throat or mouth, when there is no disease in the canal, one should use the section of the epiglottis to escape the destruction that is caused by the pre-formation.
Therefore, when we want to remove it, let us pull the epiglottis out with a small piece of wire between two circles according to its size, that is to say, a section in siffac, not in cartilage: and this place is suitable for the section, because it is separated from the flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
If the doctor is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook. Then he will find the skin, when it reaches to the canal: he should tie the blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Then let us cut the siffac that we mentioned above: and let it be shown on the section of the canal from the mucus that comes out of it when it is stopped up, and with the loss of voice by cutting off.
And let the opening be left open at some time.
When therefore the swelling goes down at some time, the two lips of the wound will be joined together again, and it will heal on its own without cartilage.
Then he should administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it heals.
Says Albucasis. Says Albucasis. The summary of this message which we have mentioned, is not, unless you know that some of the accidents which we have described above has already been relieved by the weakness of the throat: and it was raised up on death, and it wished to cut off its life-breath: therefore they advised to leave open the opening, until the evil in the illness is consumed, and this evil is three days, and almost as itself: so then they advised to close the opening, and to care for himself, until he is healed.
And this, which I myself saw, that a servant girl took a scalpel and put it into her throat, and cut with it the side of the lung canal.
And I was called to cure her, and I found her to be making a sound like one who is dying.
So I removed the wound, and I found the blood that had come out of the small lung wound. So I was confident that she had not lost much blood, nor was there any danger: and wind came out of the wound.
So I took off the bandage, and examined it carefully, until it was healed: and nothing happened to the servant girl, except that she had a hoarse voice: and after some days she recovered her health.
So therefore I say: there is no fear in cutting the epiglottis.
Concerning the incision of the hernia in the throat.
Head 44.
This hernia, called the hernia in the throat, is a large one, of the colour of the body, and it occurs frequently in women.
And it has two causes: or it is natural, or it is accidental.
Certainly there is no talent for it in the natural.
But accidental is certainly of two kinds, one of which is similar to the nodules on the tongue, and the other is a protrusion. And the other kind is similar to the hernia which is formed from the swelling of an artery. And in it is danger, and you should not make a supposition about it with the iron, unless it is small: but you test it, and investigate it with an instrument. But if you incision on it is like a large nodule, and is not suspended by any vessels: then cut off the nodule as you do others: and if it is in a bag, take it out with it, if it is in a bag: and if not, then examine it all over. Then take care of the place with it, so that it may heal, until it is cured.
Head XLV.
On the sectioning of nodules.
There are many types of nodules, and I have already mentioned all their types in detail: but it is necessary that I should mention here the difference between a nodule and an ex irritation, with which there is sometimes difficulty.
I say then, that if ex irritation is accompanied by heat, fever, and painful symptoms, until the fluid overflows and putrefaction is complete: for then the fever and heat subside.
But if the nodule is not accompanied by heat, nor fever, nor pain, and retains its own sacs, which are of a color like the body itself, and resemble beans or peas in shape, and are larger or smaller: then they should be handled in the same way as plums.
And they are of two kinds: either they are swollen, or they retain moisture. And the colors of moisture are many, as I mentioned above in the division.
It is necessary then, when you are dealing with nodules, that you should examine them carefully, and inquire into their nature with the aid of the instrument called an introducer, as it will come in the form of a tube in the chapter which follows this one.
And the method of examining secretions and nodules is this: you should take the instrument, and introduce it into a moist place in the secretion, and with your fingers slowly move it until you are certain that the instrument has entered the skin. Then put the last finger of your hand on the instrument according to the size of the secretion.
Then withdraw the introducer, and consider what comes out.
If then a moist fluid comes out running, whatever the color may be: then dry the part by means of a superficial section, as I mentioned above in the case of other secretions.
And if no fluid comes out in the space within the introducer, then you will know that it is fatty: so dry the part with a cross-shaped section, following the shape which I have already described to you: and hang it by a hook, and scrape off the skin carefully from all parts: and if you can, keep the container over it, so that you may remove the sound matter with a nodule.
But if the kista is ruptured during the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, often it happens that then it is extracted haphazardly, until there is nothing left of it.
For if there remains little or much of it, the second node returns after many days.
That if you are wounded and there remains little of it: then fill the wound with some acuter corrosive powder: and tie the wound tightly, and place over it a warm poultice, and care for the wound with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
But if there is a large nodule: then cut its two lips and care for it with that which has grown in it.
But if there is a painful pulsating new growth or not: then approach and fill the place with three times its volume of dry土, and leave it wrapped up for two days or three, until the nodule rots and the swelling subsides: then cut into what remains of the nodule.
Chapter LVI. On the head.
Regarding tools from outside for cutting and drilling.
From these are the forms of intramuscular injections, and they are three in number.
For from them is a large one, and from them a middle one, and from them a small one.
Let there be made from iron square-shaped ends at a distance from each other, so that they may enter the wound by a short way.
These are the forms of experiments, and they are three in number; one is called a needle, that is, a perforator: and they are three in number.
For from them is a large one, and a middle one, and a small one.
They agree that they should be inserted into the cavities, exits, ducts, and abscesses from him who is between them from bones.
And others are round, flat, smooth, such as the large needle with which cushions are filled, made of amber, or copper, or iron, or silver.
And their better works are what is made from citron.
And also experiences are made from black lead, which are convenient so that by them experience is gained in the fists, of which there are reflections, so that they reflect with mildness to them with their reflections.
And again there are three species. Since from them are long, from them are medium, and from them are short, according to the quantity of the width of the fist and the tightness of it.
Form of the vinches, and there are many species.
Since from them are simple ones, that is to say which has one width: and there are three species as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
And from them are blind vinches: and there are three species.
And from them are hooks having two widths, and there are three species: and from them are hooks having three widths, and there are three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of Scalpels, with which they cut and ablate nodules and pustules: and there are three species: since from them is great, medium, and small.
Their extremities with which the section is made are acute, other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed so except that with them is done a incision in curtesy of fear of the wound, or nerve: and that it heal per it from sickness, and find some tranquility from dryness somewhat more than from ablation of pustules.
They are made of brass, and they are similar to the wire with which the alcohol is made: and in the long end there is a hidden spikelet: and in it runs towards the inside, and towards the outside when you see it, as you see.
Form of the spikelets that are hidden between the fingers at the perforation of pustules: and they do not grasp them: and there are three species, great, medium, and small.
Formae Ventosarum, with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, great, middle, and small.
Let them be made of brass or copper, round in shape, slightly longer than shorter, as you see; and let them be of a fine smoothness.
And let these kinds of Wind-pits be with you great and small: that you may cut off the blood by them when you have need, and then when there is no medicine present with you.
However, do not use them for cutting off blood in any part of the body, and do not use them except in the tender parts: like the veins of the legs, and the hips, and the veins of the arms, and the nipples, and the insides of the thighs, and the groins, and those like them from the tender veins, moist.
And sometimes from them are made small instruments like the blades of scissors, according to their form: by which blood is cut off when it flows from a bleeding place, or when a wound is cut in a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
Chương đầu tiên về chăm sóc núm vú ở người, những nơi giống như núm vú ở phụ nữ:
**Về chăm sóc núm vú ở người, những nơi giống như núm vú ở phụ nữ:**
Khi núm vú của người nào đó phồng lên vào lúc nửa đêm (tức là khi bắt đầu ra mồ hôi trong giấc ngủ) cho đến khi chúng giống như núm vú của phụ nữ: và vẫn còn ẩm ướt.
Vậy ai ghét sự việc này, thì nên cắt nó ra khỏi núm vú bằng một vật nhọn vào lúc trăng tròn, theo hình dạng này từ đường chữ B đến đường chữ G: sau đó da khô toàn bộ phần nướu. Sau đó chà lên nó bằng thuốc tẩy thịt có chứa nhão. Sau đó bôi hai mép vết thương với thuốc thắt và chăm sóc nó cho đến khi lành lại.
Nhưng nếu núm vú sụt xuống về phía dưới và mềm đi vì kích thước của nó, như thường xảy ra ở phụ nữ: thì nên tìm hai đầu phía trên của nó với hai đường chéo giống như hình trăng tròn, mỗi đường dài bằng một nửa đường chữ B đến chữ G: và mỗi đường giữ một đầu của núm với nhau, để tạo thành một đường thẳng lớn hơn, theo hình dạng này từ đường chữ B đến đường chữ G: sau đó da khô phần giữa hai mép, và bỏ đi nướu, và thực hiện những việc tôi đã nói về vết rạch và bột, điều cần thiết trong quá trình chữa bệnh, cho đến khi lành lại.
If, however, you do not wish to make the incision necessary for incising him, because of his infirmity or because of the flow of blood: then you should fill the wound with a corrupting ointment immersed in linen, and leave it until it is corroded by what remains of the pus. Then take care of the patient, until he is healed.
[Regarding the pustule that occurred during the tyranny of Titilius].
Head 58.
These pustules that occurred during the tyranny of Titilius are of the hard type of staphylococci, which contain pus, and from which comes the moisture.
Which, therefore, are of those that contain moisture, should be cut with a lunar section, according to this form: from line b to line g, and so, when all that is in the pustule has been drained, then fill it with old linen, and leave it until another day.
Then the linen should be removed, and care taken with a suitable ointment to suit the patient, until he is healed.
If the pustule is of the type of nodules of staphylococci, then cut over it as we have said in the section on Staph-like nodules that are equal.
If, however, the wound extends in this way so as to emit pus, then administer a causticum to it, according to what we said in that which precedes.
Head 59.
[Regarding the incision of a pustule due to an artery or vein].
When the artery is broken and the skin above it is hard, it often happens that a pustule develops there: and likewise it happens with veins, so that it happens to them as well as a pustule and swelling.
And the signs by which it is known that the pustule and swelling are due to an artery and a vein, are these: for when the pustule is due to an artery, it is long, collected in the depths of the body; and when you press the patient's finger, you feel as if there were a hissing sound.
And that which is for the vein, is round in the manifest body.
And the cut on this apostematon is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and around the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very great. Therefore, since it should be taken care of with iron, and because it is also in the extremities, or in the head, it should be taken care of.
On that then which is from it out of the inflammation of the opening of the artery, find in the skin in length. Then open the section with a hook, then the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is detected.
Then introduce underneath it and let it penetrate until another side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Then poke the place which is between the two ligaments with a needle, until all the blood which is in it comes out, and the apostematon is solved.
Then administer the cure which generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then care for that with ointments suitable for it, until it heals.
If the apostematon is due to a vein section, then you should hold your hand, if it is possible for you from the pustule with skin. Then introduce a hook underneath the place which you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it be in it a double thread, until you bring out yourself from the other side. Then bind with that pustule with a good ligament: according to what I told you about the ligament of a thread, from two parts with its two extremities.
If, however, you should happen to extract a thread, then introduce another hook with another thread under the pustule entirely from the cut of an awl: press down, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the pustule from the middle, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut off the excess of skin, and let go what was bound with it.
Then put a very thin piece of pulli over the wound that you immersed in wine and oil. Then administer the cure, which is done with liniments and ointments, until it heals.
head L.
¶ If anything happens from a扭伤 (twist injury),
As happened in an artery and vein, so also happened in nerves: either from a punch, or from excessive work, and similar: and it often happens in places of help, or of heels, and in any place where the joints move: and it is a gray apoplexy.
Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is squeezed with a tremor, it feels in it a similar stupor.
And is not an apoplexy that集在身体的深处，但是在皮肤下， 并移动到所有部位，  ולא报告前部， 或前面， 或后部。
So whatever is in the joints does not need to be moved with iron. Perhaps however a contraction may happen.
In that however which is in the head or forehead, find skin with a touch of sensitivity. If then is a little apoplexy, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
And if is a great one, then hang it by a hook, and scrape it off: then remove it, and join the wound with a stitch: and cure it, until it heals.
Head L.
¶ About the section of apoplexies that happen in the belly.
Some people often get a lot of warts in their throats and other parts of their bodies, which they call 毒疮  (wart), by reason of similarity of these to fungis.
Their root is subtle, and the head is gross, and their lips are thick. And it is a little of them: and it is one of them that grows very big.
And I have indeed seen a man, and in his abdomen there were two little glands, which were more than other similar fungi: there was no difference between them, they were white, minute roots, and their lips were turned in, and they were falling, and moisture always ran out of them.
So I cut them open and found in the weight of one a little over ten and eight ounces and in the other a little over six ounces; and the operation in cutting them open is this, consider then, if he is weak, moist, and the color of the glands is white, moist, with fine roots: then cut him open with a wide chisel, and have before you the cautery on fire.
For often much blood is discharged during the operation: so if your blood runs, then cauterize him.
If you see him weak and terrified of the incision with the iron, then take a piece of lead carefully made, and tie it with a thong: whose mode is that which I have said, and let him go for two days.
Then add to the tightness of the lead. So do not cease to tighten the lead, when it presses on the glands, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without work.
If, however, the glands are large roots, then there is some fear and terror in their incision: especially since it is in the belly.
However, it is possible that you cut half of it. Then cauterize him, so that he does not bleed.
Then take care of the wound, until the sore heals.
And do not suppose that the glands, which are of a reddish color, few senses, and an appetizing appearance: for indeed it is a cancerous apoplexy: and I come to mind with regard to Krebs after this.
Head II.
§ On the treatment of a prominent umbilicus.
The prominence of the umbilical may result from various causes. Or from a fissure of the skin, which is above the abdomen: and comes out from it white, or intestinal, depending on whether it occurs in the remaining abdominal ruptures. Of blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said above. Or from a constricted pulse, in it.
If, however, it is due to a crack and the discharge is foul: then it is like the color of bruises similar in color to the body: and it is soft, without pain: and appears at different places. And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then its site, with what we have mentioned, varies in a greater degree. When you press the wound with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it becomes very loud at the entrance to the vein, and the pain increases.
If, however, it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not hide when pressed with your hand, nor does it tighten, nor does it increase.
That if it is due to blood, then with these signs appears a bruise towards darkness from the edge.
But if it is due to born meat: then it is a gray, thick, hard bruise, and figures according to the quantity of one unit.
If, however, it is due to airflow, then the touch of it is gentle.
And the operation in it is, to consider then, if the prominence of the umbilical is due to blood of an artery, or a vein, or airflow: then one should refrain from treating it. For in that is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said about bruises due to an artery and a vein.
That if the prominence of the umbilical is due to intestines or a hernia: then you should instruct the sick person to hold his breath and stand erect with his arms outstretched. Then the signs with caustic around the umbilical of all. Then instruct him to lie down between your hands on his back. Then with a sponge wet with water on the circumference of the umbilical over the place you have marked with the caustic. Then extend slightly below the axilla towards the upper part, with a large hook. Then bind it around firmly with a strong thread, or with a silk string with a firm knot; and let the knot be attached to the axillary ligament.
Then open slightly the section extended above the ligament. But if you have already found it captured by the ligament: then pull out the axillary and insert your finger into it, and press the intestines towards the inside of the abdomen: and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook and cut off the excess.
But if the opposite artery is for you or the vein: then surround it very much. Then return to your operation. And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them: and introduce the two needles around what you have made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then tighten the abscess in four places on the needles: and if you want, remove the needle, and leave the space until the flesh that is extended rot, and it falls away by itself: or cut it when it thins out and rots.
Then take care of the abscess with what you need from ointment, until it heals.
That if there is a prominence at the navel from flesh or from moisture: then it is necessary that you tighten the abscess, as we have said. And draw out blood, or moisture, which you pour into it.
Then take care of the abscess with what you need to strengthen the place.
Chapter LIII.
For the cure of cancer.
We have already spoken about the division of cancer and how it is cured with medicines, and how to guard against its cure with iron so that it does not ulcerate: and we have spoken about cancer generated in the womb and caution in its cure.
And the ancients said that whenever cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated: like cancer in the乳房or thigh, and similar places from member located to remove all of it: especially when it is beginning to form a mass.
When it is very old and great, it is not necessary for you to approach it.
For I could not heal out of it any one; nor did I see another before me who had come to it.
And the operation on it, when it is placed as we have said, is that you should go before it and sometimes heal the sick of black cholera. Then the bloodletting from itself if the inflammation is evident with swelling.
Then prepare the sick with preparation, in which it is placed with the operation.
Then throw on to the cancer the hooks that are appropriate for it. Then cover the whole of it with the skin, according to the scratching, until none of its roots remain: and allow the blood to run out, and do not cut it off quickly, but rather express the places, and wipe away the gross blood with your hand, or with whatever is there, as much as possible.
But if the opposite happens to you and the flow of gross blood comes out from the incision of an artery or a vein: then causticate it until the blood is cut off. Then take care of the rest of the cure on the wound, until it is healed.
On the cure from water-disease:
Head XXIV. We have already spoken at length in the division of the types of water-disease, and how the aggregation of water takes place: also the signs of each type, and the cure with medicines.
And that which is cured with the iron, is not but one kind of asclysis: and it does not approach iron of the kind of timpanitis: nor does it go deeply into the kind of hyposarcia, for that is mortal.
When you have already treated this species of water-disease with iron and the medicine has not helped you: then consider. For if the sick is already debilitated, or there is another kind of infirmity besides water-disease: such as if it has a cough, or a fever, and other things similar to these: then do not cure it with iron, for fear befalls it.
But if you see a sick person with abundant virtue, and there is no sickness with him but only hydropisis: and he is neither a boy nor an old man: then the mode of operation with him is, that you should take the sick person standing between your hands, and the minister after him should press out his wind from his hand driving water to the lower part of the plastron.
Then take a spatuled with thorns, shaped like this. Set down two acute parts, long, the acute end of it like a spatuled. But in it place something that is slightly curved, so that you do not hurt yourself with it while operating near the intestine, and let it fall.
Then consider. For if the generation of hydropisis is from part of the intestines, then it should be that you lengthen with a section three fingers' width from the navel, to the lower in straight line above the plastron.
But if the generation of hydropisis is due to liver sickness: then your section should be on the left side three fingers' width from the navel.
And if the generation of it is due to spleen sickness, then your section should be on the right side: and it is not necessary that you make a section in the place where you want to lay the sick person, so that fluids do not run to that weak place.
Then pierce with an instrument all the skin. Then introduce into it the section, and press with your hand with Spatemile between the skin, and rub, as if you were cleaning it out: and let be the quantity that is scrubbed a quantity of nail, or around it.
Then pierce the Sifac, until Spatemile reaches to the empty place: and that place is a place of water. Then take out the person, and introduce into a hole an instrument, which has this form. And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or brass, or gold, smooth, round: and in its lower part there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its end should be incised, according to the way of incision of the reed, as you see it: at its upper end there is an armilla.
When the instrument has reached the water, then immediately it [the blood] comes down on the instrument; so therefore it should be dried from the water at an intermediate time.
Since if you were to drain it more than is necessary, perhaps in an hour the sick one dies of a resolution of his animal spirit; or something happens to him that approaches death.
But drain it from it according to the strength of its pulsation and according to what you indicate to you concerning the dispositions of nursing with its pulse and its goodness.
Then take out the instrument, and retain the water.
That is, because it is retained immediately on account of the skin which retains the pore that is over the syringe: wherefrom I tell you that you should perform it according to that mode.
Then repeat the instrument on the other side if you see that the sick one can tolerate that: and also take out from the water a quantity of the pulse.
Do that on some days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains in it from the water only a little bit.
But if you are to work on the sick one, and let go of a lot of water: then take care for him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweating in bathing and sun, and he should wait for thirst: and take care for him with dried-up doctors, until he is healed: and cauterize over his stomach, and his spleen, and his liver, after taking out the water: according to what I tell you about that which precedes.
Regarding the care of infants who are born in places where their bladders are not pierced.
Chapter LV:
When any infant emerges from the womb of its mother, and its head of the muton is not pierced, or its pore is narrow, or it is not in its place.
Then you should help with the piercing of it immediately when it is born with a fine needle and water, according to this form:
Then put into its pore a small clamp made of lead, and tie it up: and hold it for three days, or four.
When therefore he would urinate, let him move and go forth. Then take away his urine.
And if you do not put lead on him, it is possible that the urine which has run over the place should not prevent him from going away.
But he whose hole is tight, is healed with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
But those in whom the hole is not in its proper place are harmed. That is, because from him who is born, the hole is at the end of the penis: so that he cannot urinate in front, until he raises his penis by hand to the top. And there is no generation in him, therefore, so that the seed cannot come to the womb according to its right course: and it is a great foul disease.
And the mode of action in him is that he lies down on his back. Then extend his penis by your left hand with a strong extension, and strike the head of his penis from the proper place with an edge, or a sharp chisel: as is the cut of a pen, or like you cut something, so that it may come to resemble the head of the penis in shape, and may fall into its middle, according to what is required.
And cause yourself not to have a flow of blood during your operation. For this often happens. So he cuts it with him who severs the blood, and takes care of the wound, until it heals.
As for what happens to the prepuce and the head of the penis, and corruption, blackening, and adhering,
The head.
These matters often happen to the penis, and the flesh becomes great with foul meat.
And from this there is a bad thing, and another that is not bad.
So you should hang it by a small hook, and cut it off entirely. Then put a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian ointment on it. Then care for the wound with the oil of vitriol, until it heals.
That if the albather is malicious and of a foul color, then you should administer cauterization after incising it and shaving it.
If, however, the albather is captured in the prepuce and not circumcised, and is part of the albather within the prepuce and part of it outside: then you should remove the albather that is within first, until it hardens, then care for the one outside: for when you care for it at the same time, the prepuce does not secure itself unless it is pierced.
And also happen and also in the testicles, and the prepuce black and corruption. Therefore, you should bring together all that has been diminished, and what wishes to be corrupted, or that which has already been corrupted.
Then put a line of honey on the wound that has already been crushed with flour from a miller's sifting apparatus and herb from a cribbler's sifting apparatus.
Then care for it with the remaining cure, until it heals.
If, however, a flux of blood occurs, then administer cauterization with lunar cauldron, according to this form.
For the cauldron is helpful in two ways at the same time, that is, for the flow of blood and for the wound when it corrupts.
That if it corrupts the head of the penis and destroys all in an hour: then you should insert a plumbi apium canal into the meatus primum, so that it can dribble on it.
However, the prepuce adheres to the head of the penis, and this type of adhesion does not occur unless the prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it: and when adhesion occurs due to injury or apoplexy: you should therefore scrape it off with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is released, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
If it is difficult to distinguish them exquisitely, then one should cut something out of the head of the penis, and from the foreskin. That is, because when the foreskin is delicate, it may be pierced quickly because of its lightness.
Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not stick again.
Then treat with astringent wine until it hardens.
Chapter LVII.
The washing of babies and the cure for error by accident.
Circumcision is not a cure for continence, as are the other wounds; nevertheless, since it is the result of our desire and its use is proper to boys, we must mark this operation as superior and more beneficial, leading to health.
I therefore say that the ancient ones did not write about circumcision in any of their books; for they do not use such things in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired this knowledge through experimentation.
That is, because I have discovered most of the arts, and the use of phlebotomy and washing, circumcising with a knife, and binding with thread, and incising with a nail. They use leech, and ligature by twine, and cut with scissors.
And I myself have already tested all these methods, and I did not find a better washing than circumcision with a knife and binding with thread.
For when washing with a leech, the skin often escapes. For the foreskin has two skins; so perhaps one skin is cut, and the other is wrapped in a cloth; so it is necessary to consider cutting the second one as well, with the pain that would result. And when washing with a leech, that is, with the finger, as surgeons do, an incision made at the end of the male member does not secure it; because perhaps it enters a hole in it.
But in the washing of the foot with the nail, maybe he has rusted the iron and has ruined your operation; and the skin of the boy is by nature short, and many times are born like this so that they do not need washing; but I have already seen it.
But in the washing with the pincers and the bandage with a thread, a good experiment has shown to me: because the pincers are proportionate to the incision: indeed, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below. But when you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportionate and incise one according to the operation at the same time: and a compression of similar figure is made, containing the skin of the arm from all parts, with which no error falls at all.
And the mode of the operation is its own, so that you may guess it out, especially if he is from among those who understand a little, which you do not do, unless you tie the thread in his arm alone: and let him go until another day.
Then may he rejoice and be glad in all ways as much as possible for you, since he receives intelligence of it. Then make him stand between your hands that are prepared to stand, and not sitting down: and hide the pincers in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Then introduce your hand into his arm, and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the arm comes out. Then wash it from him since it is gathered in it with filth.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread. Then tie the lower part with the same sort of ligature as before. Then hold it with your index finger and retain the lower ligature well with your thumb, and incise between the two ligatures. Then wipe the skin quickly upwards, and take out the head of the arm. Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better so), and put on the powder from above. And over the powder put a cloth in which is spread out the flesh that has been cut and cooked in rosin water, concussed with rose oil. Afterwards leave it on itself until the next day: and take care of the rest by cure, until it is well.
The form of the forceps for cleaning this is as follows.
The two ends should be turned towards the inside and they should meet each other: let no splint go into it like a bar of the claw: and make the length of the two acute angles equal to the length of the two hands equally.
But a mistake that is made in cleaning is this: for perhaps it shuns all of the inner skin, or part of it near the incision.
Therefore you should spread it out from your hour with your nail before the site of the incision: and let it fall according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your nail, then take it out with a forceps and cut it.
If however it has passed over three days and remains what is under the swollen branch, incision: then let go of it until the sore is well, and scrape it off easily, and cut it according to how you have prepared it for yourself: and caulk you from the head of the branch. For that will not harm it.
Take care therefore that the bone is healed with the powder, which we discussed in the book on powders: and if it is incised from the skin above the line, and grows up towards the top, it also does no harm to it.
Take care therefore for what we have said until it is well.
Chapter LVIII.
De extractio of retained urine in bladder.
Retained urine in the bladder, is caused by a deposit made from a stone, or congealed blood, pus, or flesh born, and similar things which we have discussed under different methods of cure.
And if the Vrina is not relieved, and you see that it is because of the Stone which has already become attached to the neck of the womb: then it is necessary that he be made sick on his knees. Then he shall set his feet upon his back, and shall stretch forth his belly from the upper part of his back, and shall press down his sickness as much as it is possible for him to do. Then it is considered with the neck of the womb towards the expelling of the Stone to the rear: why is the Vrina relieved?
Which if it is not relieved with this that I have said, and the sick one is a problem: then it is necessary that you administer the extraction with a tool, which is called a syringe, whose this is its form It is made of silver, and let it be fine, soft, and rounded like the feather of an owl in fineness, long like the palm of a hand and half again as long; and has in its head a fine tube.
And the way out of the Vrina through itself is that you take a double thread, and tie it well in its end with wool, or cotton, good knot: and you introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and you cut with nippers if there is anything excess from the wool, but really introduce into the tube with shaking, as you raise.
Then dip the syringe in oil, or in butter, and in alum poultice: and make the sick one sit on a chair, and insert the womb, and his rod with the wet oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the rod easily, until it reaches to the root of the rod.
Then double itself on the upper side from the ombilicus.
Then push the syringe inside until it reaches the bladder, and let the sick one feel that he has reached the empty place: and this does not happen according to this order, unless because of the passage, in which you insert, is in the place where there is a bend.
Then extend the filament slowly with wool. Then follow the thread of the wound with the wool.
Then extract it, and make the thread run along the urethra: and again go to the bladder, and do not cease doing this, until the urine is discharged, and the pain is eased.
De quality of the enema of the bladder with the clepsydra.
Head LIX.
When there is an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is caught up in it, and water and medicines are to be distilled into it: then do with the instrument which is called a clepsydra, and this is its shape.
It is a closed vessel, that is to say, a cistern. And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, like the eyes.
And the concaved place, in which is the thing that drives it without addition, until when it is drawn with it there is something attracted from the moisture: and when it is driven, along with it far away: second because it does the clepsydra, through which naphtha is thrown, that is to say, Greek fire in battles of Mars.
When you are about to throw water into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the water, and draw it out with what drives it upward: for water is drawn into the concaved place of the clepsydra.
Then introduce its end into the urethra, according to what we have said about the syringe. Then drive the water with it, so that it comes to the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it:
The shape of a delicate enema with which the bladder is enameled.
Be it of silver, or of copper-alloy: and its handle should be a little higher than the base, and under it a groove in which the thread runs along.
Then take the urine of a lamb, and put it into it the moisture, whereby the wound will be washed. Then bind it between two knots with strong knotting twine: and heat it slightly in the moisture over a fire.
Then introduce the end of the catheter into the urine, then tighten your hand on the uesicam with the moisture so that it does not leak, until the sick person feels better, which means that the moisture has already reached the wound.
But if you do not have present urine, then take a fragment of parchment, and make it into a circle, and pierce it from all its circumference. Then introduce a strong twine into these holes, as they rotate. Then collect the circle, as is collected alsofrustum: once you have put in it that which you take out of moisture, and oils, and waters.
Then bind the twine to the instrument: and do so with your hand as you did with the urine for expression with your hand, until the moisture has reached the wound.
The Head of Chapter L.X.
§ On the extraction of Stone.
I have spoken on the division of the species of stone, and on the cure of it with medicines: and I have spoken on the difference between the stone that is generated in the kidneys, and the uesica, and the signs of both: and I have spoken on the stone that is generated in the urine by hand, and on the section: and this is a stone that is generated in the uesica properly: and that which is formed on the thorns: and I am telling it with an evident and abbreviated exposition.
I say, then, that stone generated in the uesica, often happens to boys.
And of the signs of it is that urine flows out from the uesica like water in its subtility: and appears in it white sand, and chafes the sick man's uesicam, and suffers with it, and often hangs. Then it erects itself, and flows out with it the anus in many of them.
It is easy to heal boys as long as they are not more than fourteen years old. And it is difficult to heal the elderly. But in youths it is medium, because it is between that and this; and the healing is easier if the stone is larger: but if it is small, the cure is delayed.
But when we come to the healing, it is necessary that we should first make the sick one free from all the dung which is in his bowels: for this sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone.
Then let the sick one be taken with his feet, and be shaken and moved to the lower parts: that the stone may go down into the deep of the loins, or sometimes jump out of its high place.
Then let him sit with his hands prepared between your hands, and his hands under his hips, so that the whole loins may go down into the place of the bowels.
Then examine him and touch him from without.
But if you feel the stone in space, then at once approach with a cutting section above it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then you should wipe the index finger with oil from your left hand, if the sick one is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a complete youth: and let him put himself in some part of his body, and examine the stone until it stands under your finger: and turn it little by little towards the throat.
Then press on it with your finger and push it towards the outside against the place where you want to section it off: and instruct one minister to press the groin by his hand, and another minister to extend the testicles by his right hand from above: and with his other hand, to move the skin which is under the testicles in that part where the sectioning is.
Then introduce a spatulum which has this shape. And find in it what is between the loins and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the left side: and let the section be made over it so that the stone can come out from it easily, according as its exit may be larger, if it may come out.
Perhaps the finger, which is in the anus near the incision, has been compressed and has been removed without any difficulty.
And you should know that from the stone are the angles and edges, which is why it is difficult to remove it because of those.
And out of it comes something soft, similar to a gland, and round: and the exit of it is easy.
So add to that which has angles and edges, into the fissure.
If it is not removed in this way, then one should invent a device for it: or you can twist it with an awkward gesture, whose end is like the Moon, which twists over the stone and does not slip from it: or as you insert a thin instrument under it, with a curved end.
If you can't reach it from above, then slightly widen the hole. If something makes you bleed, cut it off with a scalpel.
But if the stone is more than one, then push in the first big one into the rectum. Then cut on top of it. Then push in a small one after it, and do the same if there are two or more.
If it is very large, then ignorance is how to cut off from the top with a big incision. Since it happens to an ill person of the two things, or that he dies, or because frequent urine passes through him: soon, since the place does not consolidate at all.
But administer an expulsion of it until it is removed: or a device in its fracture with pincers, until you cut it off forcibly.
But when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with thistle, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it tightly, and place a damp cloth on top of the wound, or oil rosin, and cold water: so that it may be bound by a blister.
Then re-bandage the sick person on his neck, and do not remove the bandages until the third day. And so when you have solved it [the wound], immerse the place in water and much oil.
Then care for the wound with unguent of daphnic and basilic until it heals.
But if it should happen that the wound is infected and there is heat and corruption, and the same things: for instance, if the blood congeals in the urethra, and urine is prevented from it: and it may be known from the issue of blood with urine. So put your hand into the wound and draw out the blood. For if it remains, it may cause urinary tract infection and putrefaction of its discharge.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and oppose any kind of thing that belongs to cure, until it heals.
And during the whole period of cure, let two pillows be placed under the legs, and let the patients lie on their backs, for medicines placed upon the spot to act.
If the stone is small and sits in the meatus of the urine, and turns in it, and prevents the exit of urine: then care for the stone with oil before you attempt to cut it out. For often there will be no cure after an operation, for I have already tried this remedy.
And take the Perforator from iron, which has this shape, triangular ends, acute, fixed on a piece of wood.
Then take a thread and tie it to the penis under the stone so that it does not recede into the urethra.
Then insert the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until it reaches the stone: and turn the Perforator in the stone by hand little by little: and feel for the piercing, until you make it go through from one side to another.
For urine is immediately relieved.
Then press your hand upon what remains of the stone from the outside of the penis. For it will break, and come out with urine, and the sick one will be healed.
If, however, you are not prepared for this treatment because of something that prevents it: then tie a cord under the stone, and another cord above the stone. Then dry off on top of the stone in the middle of the two knots. Then remove it. Then loosen the knot, and clean the congealed blood, which has formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie a cord under the stone, unless it returns to the wound: and a cord above, unless when it is loosened, the skin returns to its place, and covers the bone: and for this reason it is necessary that you should tie the upper cord, so that the skin returns upward, so as to return at your own complement, and cover the bone, as we have said.
Chapter LXI.
Regarding the removal of stones in women.
Stones do not form much in women.
If, however, a stone occurs in any of them, then the treatment is difficult, and it is prohibited for many reasons.
One reason is that the woman might be a virgin.
And a second reason is that you should not examine a woman who is engaged in marriage, or one who has husbands: for she might accuse you of attempted rape.
A third reason is that you should not examine a woman who knows the art well, especially the hand operation: for she might recognize it and accuse you of attempted harm.
A fourth reason is that the distance from the stone to the place where it is to be removed is too great: for there is a risk of error in the depth of the cut, and there is danger in it.
If necessity compels you to do so, then you should take a woman doctor who is well-versed in the art: and there are few of them.
However, if you are concerned about this, then seek a married doctor who is subtle and well-versed in the art of women's affairs: and there are few of them. If not, ask a married woman who is skilled in this part of the art: and let her be present, especially when she does what you instruct her to do in the investigation of the stone.
First of all, whether the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that he introduce his finger into her vulva and ask for blood.
If he then finds it, he should bind it with his own hand, and then order the obstetrician to introduce his finger into the woman's vulva and ask about the blood, after he has placed his left hand on her womb and pressed it firmly.
If he then finds the stone, then it is necessary that he slowly move it from the opening of the vagina to the lower part with all his strength, until he reaches it at the root of the pelvis.
Then he should wipe it off at the middle of the vagina at the root of the pelvis, preparing himself from either side, and feel the stone in that part; and his finger should not move from the stone, binding it beneath: and let a small incision be made first. Then he should introduce the ray above that section.
Then he should introduce the ray above that section. If he then feels the stone, then he should add to the second section a quantity proportional to the amount of stone discharged from it.
And you should know that there are many types of stones. For this reason, some are small, others large, some smooth and some sharp, some long and some round, having branches.
So you should know the kind of stone, as I have explained to you about that which you desire.
If, however, blood makes you win, then add to the place of lying three times, and hold it for an hour, until the blood is separated.
Then turn back to your operation, until the stone is discharged from the vagina: and do as I have told you, preparing yourself with the instruments, which I have mentioned for removing the stone from the vagina, that you may help yourself with them in your operation.
If, however, blood makes you win, and you know that the flow of blood comes from an artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and tighten it with the powder as it descends: and do not change it: and let go of the stone, and do not take it out. For a woman may perhaps die because she is weak. Then the concern for the wound.
How then does the sharpness of the blood subside after days, and the place becomes rotted, so that you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Head LII.
§ On cutting below the hernial membrane with water.
Rames' water does not exist, unless there is an accumulation of moisture on the testicular skin which contains a single loop: and it is called sifac.
And when it is in its own pannus itself, which nature has prepared for it in a certain part, until it is putrefied: that is another thing, and that skin between the white sifac is what we have said: and it does not make it except rarely.
And the generation of this branch comes from the weakness that occurs in the testicles: why this substance is poured out onto them. And when it happens from a blow above the testicles.
And this moisture is having many colors. Or indeed its color changes to reddishness, or it is bloody red, or fecundous, black, or white watery, and that which is more so: and it is that which is more.
And the signs by which one can know where the accumulation of water is, are these. For if it is in the white sifac, that we have described, then the swelling is round in length to some extent like a figure of a circle: and the testicle does not appear, because moisture contains it from all sides.
And if there is moisture in its own pannus itself, then the swelling is round with a part of it, and for that reason men estimate that it is another thing.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls backwards.
When therefore you wish to know the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the swelling with an intruder's square, whose shape preceded. Accordingly, so that which is emitted from the introducer's exit, judge it to be between itself.
So when we come to cure with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person, if possible, let him bleed and see his body well filled.
Then he should lie down on his back on a high bed and put many blankets under him.
Then sit down on his left side and instruct the minister to sit on his right side, extending his leg between the skin of his testes and the side of the scrotum towards the pubic bone.
Then take a wide razor and scrape the skin of the testes from middle length, up to the chest: and make the incision according to the straight line that divides the skin of the testes, until it reaches the white substance enclosed: and examine it carefully, or gently remove it, as you wish, and scrutinize it well according to quantity that is possible for you.
Then pierce the closed sac with a wide perforation and drain out all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with a hook, and extend the sac towards the top, and do not touch the skin that covers it: and cut the sac in any way possible for you to cut it, either completely, or only partly, especially the side that is thin. For if you do not scrutinize well, there will be no security in the incision, except that it returns to the water.
But if his sperm should come out of his skin during your operation: then, when you have finished the incision of the sac, reduce him. Then join together the two lips of the skin of the testes with a suture.
Then care for him as you do for other wounds, until he is healed.
That if there is any corruption of the sperm with other color, then you should tie the ligaments that are suspended, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testes with the suspension, and drain out the sperm: then care for it with that which I have said.
If, however, water is gathered in two parts, then you shall know that there are two branches; therefore dry one part as you did the other, equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that the operation is one, then do it; and then wash away the blood. And introduce the wool that has been immersed in oil, or rosin-oiled, into the scrotum; and put another wool that you immersed in wine and oil on top of the two testicles, and spread it out over them, and wipe the eye with it: and then place double cloths on top, and they will be clean; and bind them together on top with a string that has six turns according to this form.
Then two cloths are to be taken and spread out and filled with carmine according to this similarity: and the ends that are pressed together by a thong, or by wet wool; and they are to be gathered together with a cinch in the lumbar region of the arms: and one end is to take hold above some bone until it reaches the back, and the second end is to take hold towards the side of the ribcage: and the two ends are to rest on the two thighs below, and the other end is to rest on the two hips, and all the cinch is to be gathered together in the lumbar region of the arms.
And, whenever this rope is used artificially with a knife as a place of the section with iron: and it is, that you take a fine knife-edge knife, and separate it along with it from the skin of the testicles: and it catches fire, according to what we have described; until it can be detected by the white liquid containing water: then take the knife, according to this form.
It is similar to Greek letters.
Then pierce with it that little hole in the liquid, and it catches fire, until all the moisture comes out.
Then spread out the liquid with a hook, and scrub it with a small knife that catches fire; and cut it off completely, as you are able to do, until you have removed all of it.
And let there be no fire in the oil, lest it burn the skin.
And you should know that this operation is salutary, and longer than the flow of blood, and better than the operation with the section.
But if in the hour of the section or in the hour of the cautery there is an opposito to you, or warm apostema, or a flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary that you cure what opposito does to you with the cure which is appropriate to him, according to what has been said above.
But if he is timid and does not expect this operation, because of its horror: then you should administer the perforation according to what I have told him: and it is.
When it is certified to you by him about the ramus which is aqueous: then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised chair.
Then pierce the apostema in the lower part of him with a spatumili side: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and leave the opening wide until all the water runs out.
Then put a cloth on the place, and tie him up, and let him go to run out the remaining water: then care for him, until the wound heals.
But if there is an opposito to the exit of water in the hour when you pierce it: and this is not unless for this reason, because the white pannicle does the opposito in the orifice of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then you should introduce the feather into the wound, or the instrument with which the water of hydropics is removed, whose form precedes: or add a little to the operation of the wound.
And you should know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or about them. When it is accumulated, then it will return in the same way, and the sick person will spend his days.
Chapter LIII.
On the care of the ramus carnose.
You should know that in the section on this ramus, there is a fear which leads to perdition in many dispositions. So then he left me well from her.
And I remember the operation on her, and the appearance of the wound.
I say then that many defects occur in the bodies, from which the testicles are made: and it comes about from many causes, namely.
Or from acute or sharp excess, which runs to the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the colour of the swelling is according to the colour of the body, and it does not be known to him pain: and the swelling is grey.
And perhaps it is a stone swelling, whose colour is dark, and there is no feeling of it.
And sometimes it is from the nodding of arteries, and their swelling: as I have already reminded you of that: or from the swelling of veins.
That then which is from the swelling of arteries, is known through the position of the swelling, when you compress it with your fingers. And it is not necessary that you touch it all at once.
That then which is from the swelling of veins, does not scatter anything away from it when you compress it with your fingers.
And it is also possible that this same colour should come about in a section, and on the other flesh: and it is, so as to separate the skin of the testicles. Then extend your hand upwards, and pull it out with a nail or something: and free the suspender from the water, and tie the rope of the suspender, and cut off the suspender after you have freed it from all parts of it under the arm.
If then the solidified flesh is with those born flesh, then you must attract the flesh and cut it off.
And if the adhesion is to something in the nipple, or in what is between the nipples: then you must free all that adhesion, and cut it off with a round incision.
If then the birth of flesh is in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then you must cut off all that, and pull out the flesh, as we have said.
When your operation is complete, cut the wound with a blade, and fill it with oil infused with rose water and wine. Then take care of the wound itself with the remaining cure, until it heals.
Chapter LXIIII.
¶ On the treatment of the vine with the grape vine.
The use of the poultice is good, wrapped somewhat with wetting, like a blister, with softening of the testicles; and it is difficult to move or exercise, and walking.
And in the treatment of this disease there is a fear because of the previous memory.
But we should say about the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
I will tell you that you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat. Then push the suspender of the testicles to the lower part. Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, which are next to the scrotum: and let someone else hold it and extend it with a forceful extension.
Then cut with a sharp knife across the legs of the scrotum, until the membrane is detected.
Then scrape all parts off, as we have told you in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Then fix it in them with a knot where the double thread is; and tie it again in the last place where the vines are. Then dry them in a straight middle section according to the length of the body, and pull out what is gathered from the腐腐的湿气。
Then take care of the wound with the remaining cure, so that the membrane which nourishes one testicle does not grow again, and let the membranes fall off. For that is not bad in itself.
But if it happens to all the vines, then you must take them out with the vines because of this cut so that they do not shut off the nourishment of the testicles, because of the incision, and do not become scarred or withered, and are not harmed by them.
Chap-L XV .
¶ On the cure of intestinal ramen.
The ramus of this ramus is taken from the section that occurs on the right side in the extensive sigh of the small intestine at the root of the pelvis by a mirror of the thigh.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle. And this rupture is either from a sigh or from an extension of it.
And these two types occur for various causes. Or from a blow. Or from a twitch. Or from a noise. Or from the lifting of something heavy, and others like it.
And a sign when it is from an extensive sigh. It is what happens gradually over a long period of time and not all at once: and it is a bulge equal to the depth: therefore, because the sigh compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it when it is from the section of a sigh, because it suddenly causes a painful swelling from its beginning: and it is a bulge different, appearing under the skin and near to it: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of it towards the external sigh.
And when it emerges with the intestine intact: and this is called the intestinal ramus, and the bulge: and sometimes it is done with a twitch.
And sometimes it runs in the feces of the intestine and retains it there: and it is accompanied by that with a variety of diseases: because it causes a painful swelling, especially when it is pressed.
And in the treatment of diseases with iron there is a fear: for this reason one should guard against falling into it.
And the method of its operation is, as you command the sick person to bring his intestine by hand to his internal concavity, if he submits to return. Then it was laid on top of its neck between your hands: and the legs were raised.
Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the top, and dry the skin of the testicles entirely along its length. Then put two hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to how you want to open the incision with them: and let the incision be made according to the quantity, which is possible, so that it comes out from it.
Then scrape the skin off, and what is under the skin of the testes, until it is found when touched that it is white all over: then insert your index finger into it where it follows the testicle, into it where it is between the white skin, and between the second skin, and firmly adhere to it in the back part of the scrotum.
Then move with the right hand towards the inner skin of the testes: and when you do this, stretch out the white skin to the top, with the left hand: and wipe your eyes with the skin on the side of the incision: and instruct the minister to extend the eye in the opposite direction: and you should loosen the attachment that is at the back after it has been completely loosened.
And ask your fingers if there is nothing there from the intestines that are not broken down in the white skin or hard. If there is anything there: then push it towards the lower navel.
Then take hold of the acme, where there is a thick thread, made from ten threads: and insert it behind the last skin, that is under the skin of the testes which follows the incision: then cut off the ends that protrude from the thread, until there are four threads. Then make some of them into a cross-like shape: and tie them with the alsifach, about which I have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testes with a firm knot, so that it cannot send any of the blood that nourishes it to them, lest there be an ulcer. And put another knot on top of the first one, far from it by two fingers. And after these two knots let go of the skin from the incision a quantity as big as a finger: and cut off all of it roundly, and remove it from there.
Then dry in the lower part of the skin of the testes at the section from which runs blood and pus: as we have told in what has been preceded.
Then put the wool dipped in oil and place on the navel: and administer the ligature which we have described. And when the sutures are taken out, apply to it a piece of white wax that we have mentioned, after incising its edge, with caution as to the flow of blood. For this is apt to happen many times. And discharge the ligature, until it falls away by itself.
But if its fall is delayed, then moisten it with warm water: and place on it the piece that we have mentioned, until it falls away.
Then take care of the navel with the remaining cure for the wound, until it is healed.
Chapter LVI.
[The Ramie plant]
In this ramage there was no one who dared to attempt a cure with iron.
And first they said that it happened as we have told about the ramage which is with the vine. Which is to say that the strings should be loosed after cutting over them with ease on the lower part: and then dry in the middle, and take care afterwards for opening itself up, until they fall away: and take care of the navel, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
Chapter LVII.
[The Separation Made in the Groin]
When rupture occurred in the groin as we have told, and an opening was made, but nothing came out of the intestines: but if anything comes down to them, it is little, and goes back again every now and then: but if prolonged for any length of time, a fissure is added to the skin, until the intestines come out into the skin.
And this thing happened by reason of the extension of the skin in the groin as we have said. Which is to say that the skin extends: and then softens, and an opening becomes apparent, and comes out.
And his cure is with a cautery, as has been preceded in his narration.
And when he is cured with iron, according to this manner: and it is so, that the sick man lies on his back between your hands. Then dry up the place of the rupture and eminence, by section along its breadth, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Then tighten the ligature and, which are under the skin, until when it is detected there is a white pus, that is under the skin which follows itself.
Then take a ray and put the patient on the place of eminence from the pus, and press the patient to the depth of the hand.
Then cover the two places of eminence on the end of the ray from the pus with a stitch, connecting one to the other: then remove the end of the ray.
And do not injure the ligature at all, nor stretch one nor any other, as I told you to know in the cure of the intestinal branch.
Then this cure for the wound. When you cut the fillet, clean it out, and restore the bone, until it is hardened.
For the stitch holds fast, and eminence of the rupture is not added.
And the cautery is better in this place: for it is closer to salvation.
Head XXVIII.
As regards the softening of the skin of the testes, there are three methods: first, by being dipped in hot water; second, by the application of hot plasters; third, by being rubbed with a hot cloth.
The skin of the testes is often softened in some men, because the flesh between them becomes soft, and they acquire an attractive appearance.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to cure himself, that he lie on his back, and that he cover the whole soft skin which has been softened over the natural skin.
Then he will join the two lips together with a stitch: and if there is a need for it, in the first place three stitches of the softened skin, or four, and a firm stitch.
Then incision between sutures.
Then care for the cure of the remaining wounds, until they are healed, and let the sutures fall off.
Chapter LIX.
§ On Castration.
You should know that castration is an excommunication in our law: and for that reason it would be fitting for me to forget about it in this book of mine: and its reminder is not necessary, except for two reasons.
One is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when he is questioned about it: and so that he may know how to cure him who has it.
And the other mode is that we often have needed castration in some of our animals, for their benefits, such as rams, horses, and cats, and similar kinds of animals.
I therefore say that castration is done according to two modes. Or by rubbing. Or by a slits and cuts.
But in that which is done by rubbing, the course of the operation is this: that we should make the animal sit in hot water, until his testicles become soft and slack, and hang down: then we should cut them off with our hands, until they are completely gone and do not appear under the touch.
But in castration by slit and cut, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and with your left hand press the skin of his testicles.
Then bind the suspensory, and dry on all of the one cut, until when they come out two testes: then cut it after you have scalded them both, and do not leave on them any cloth of a kind of suture, which is over the skin.
And this mode of castration is better than that which is done by rubbing: because by rubbing perhaps some remains of the testicles are left behind, so that the animal desires to have coitus.
Then care for the wound, until it heals.
Chapter LXVII.
§ On the Curing of Hermaphrodites in Two Ways.
A hermaphrodite is from the testicles according to two ways. The sperm of these is, for it seems that there is a space, or the skin of the testicles, in that it is between two testicles, figure like a small woman, in which are hairs: and sometimes when it runs urine from him who is in the skin of the testicles.
But in women there is one kind, and it is a small woman over the skeleton like a testicle of a man, emerging towards the outside: of which one is like a penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of the three kinds, two from the testes, and one from a woman, is this: for you must break down the added flesh, until you remove the impression of them. Then take care of these with the remaining wounds.
But as for the second kind of men, from which urine flows out, which is on the skin of the testes, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
Chapter LXXI.
As for the incising of the scrotum and the flesh emerging in women.
The tentigon should be added strongly to the natural thing until it is satisfied and becomes ugly in appearance: and sometimes it grows great in some women, so that it spreads out like a penis, and reaches up to coitus.
You should therefore hold the tentigon with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it off: and you must not at all go into the incision, especially in the deep root: so that blood does not flow.
Then take care of this wound with the treatment, until it heals.
But as for the middle flesh, it is the flesh that is born in the womb of the mother, until it fills it up: and perhaps it flows out to the outside according to the resemblance of the tail: and because of this they call certain disease tailed. You should therefore cut it off as you cut off the tentigon, and take care of it until it heals.
On the Care of the Utero (womb), which is not pierced.
De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.
(The treatment of the uterus, which is not pierced, or the foramen ovale.) (And it is either natural or accidental.)
(Accidental is from an illness that precedes it; and the same [illness] may have come about either from flesh that has been added to it, or from a fine spitting, or from a lump: and it may have taken place in the depths of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part; and it prohibits coitus and impregnation, and giving birth, and perhaps menstruation.)
(And the knowledge of it is acquired by the examination of midwives, if the accumulation is evident near at hand.)
(If it is not evident, then seek it with your fingers or a lamp.)
(If there is an accumulation of fine spittle between the two lips, then bring it closer and remove it.)
(And it is, as you place a handful of cotton wool on the two lips.)
(Then place your fingers from both hands together, and the woman should lie on her back with spread legs.) (Then stretch the two lips with force, until the fine spittle is removed, and the accumulation opens up.)
(Then take a piece of wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot; and let the woman eat it every day so that the spot does not stick.)
(If the spittle is thick and sticky, then you must separate it with a wide leaf of mint.)
(If the accumulation is flesh that has been born, then suspend it with a hook and cut it: and have with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without causing pain, such as acacia and dragon's blood, and such agate with albuginous lead.)
(Then insert a large silver tube so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for several days; and administer lion's mane dried, then treat the rest with the usual treatment until it heals.)
And sometimes when I am born from the womb, the birth of the flesh of others: it is necessary then that they be struck according to this mode: because there is no opposition with iron at all, while there is an apostema of cancerous, since there is a cancer in the womb.
Chapter LIII. On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athahelil, and botry rubeae (bloody rash) in women's wombs.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athahelil, and botry rubeae in women's wombs.
Hemorrhoids are an opening of the venous orifices, until they bleed profusely regularly.
When then are treated these hemorrhoids, they become thori; and I have already spoken in the division of their kinds, and of their signs: and here I will speak of those which receive cure, and of those which do not.
I say, then, that the hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear to have any sense: then there is no cure for them with iron.
But which from these hemorrhoids are in the opening of the womb above where the sense falls, they are those which are cured.
It is necessary then that you enter the woman into a cold house. Then extend Athahelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then dust on them near the flow of blood from one cut with a powder without mordient; as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thorns, and such like to them.
Then push his feet against the wall at an hour. Then put her into a cold water.
If the bleeding persiste: then let her sit in a decoction of sommach, and of corn-meal, and of gall, and such like.
Then take wheat flour, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
But if the blood is separated from it, then it is good: but if not, then make adhere to her back furrows, and nettle-sores, without scarification.
Then take a piece of cloth and dip it in taraxacum juice, or in arnglosa's juice, or in the sap of the boughs of alnet trees, that is to say, in Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the leech.
When the poultice has cooled down, then take care of the place with the ointment, until it has healed.
Albarth is really similar to taraxacum in shape and is rough in appearance.
It must therefore be that you make it appear from it, according to what I have said in the illustration, equally: and take care of it, until it has healed.
Chapter LXXIV.
Regarding the Output Wound That Occurs in the Uterine Cavity.
Various poultices occur in the womb, such as cancer, and hard poultices, ulcers, blisters, scabs, and frostbitten flesh, that is to say, herpes, coldness, fistulae, hemorroids, warts, and burns.
And I have already said concerning all these diseases and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures, in a division: it is necessary for me to speak in this book about the hot poultice that occurs in the womb, when it is from poultices that collect blood, and how to know its opening with iron.
It is necessary, therefore, that you consider. Then if the pain of the poultice in its beginning is sharp with its percussion and flame and fever: and you see it red: if it falls on top of it, then do not like its perforation: and take care of it with that which pleases it over maturation, until such time as it has calmed down.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a chair that she can reach by two seats, and lie down, or lean back, and gather her feet toward the lower side of the femur: and let her hips be expanded, and put her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable ligature.
Then the midwife should sit down on the right side of the bed, and administer the instrument with which she opens the maternal womb.
And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument, you make the womb smooth with the radius of its depth: so that it does not enter by means of the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and hurts the sick.
But if the instrument is more than the depth of the womb, then it is necessary that you should put a padding on top of the depth of the womb: so that you prevent the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb: and it is necessary that you should put a turner, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that he holds the instrument, and that he turns the turner, until the depth of the womb has opened.
When it therefore appears and is touched by hand, and is soft and smooth: then you should separate it from the head with a cotton wad.
When it therefore drains the pus, then you should put a cotton wad soaked in rose oil: or in viride oil, in which there is some stinginess: and you should put the cotton, and pull out a piece into the depth of the womb.
And place outside on the womb, and on the wool of the lamb dipped in water, in which there are some bubbles:
Then take care after two days with ointment that is suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes when the womb is washed and the lamb, so that it swells with water and honey: then with water in which there are some bubbles of a radix of lily, or of long aristo: and then return to the ointment.
That if the lamb is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary that you should refrain from curing it with fire: indeed take care of itself with what we have said in division.
Chapter LXXVI
Doctrines on obstetrics, how they treat the foetus according to a non-natural form of exit.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to recognize the natural puerperal condition at first.
From the signs then, when you see a woman compressing herself towards her lower parts, and desiring to smell the air, and relishing herself when something is passing out of her, then you should know that this birth is in the natural form, and the exit of the child is over her head, and the second with it: or suspended, or hanging from her navel.
When then you see these signs, it is necessary for the womb to compress so that the child can descend quickly.
For when it has passed over her head, the second passes with it, and is cleansed of its excess by a good purification.
But if this birth is outside these times, it is unnatural, unbelievable.
For when the child sometimes exits with his feet first, and the body goes out before her head, and his feet and hands are one, or his hand is one or his foot alone: or when her head and hands go out, or when it turns inside out, and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar figures that are unbelievable.
It is therefore necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and careful in all these things, and to beware of error and delusion: and I will show you every form, and what is the nature of it, and interpret it by that, and point out on it.
When the child exits with his natural exit over her head, and it presses on her, and the birth is difficult for her, and you see its strength already weakened: then make her sit on a chair, or let the women support her: and wash her with a fennel decoction, and with wet oils.
Then the obstetrician should introduce his finger between her labia, and feel for the second inside, and wipe it with his nail, until he finds what is within her from moisture: and press the womb of the woman, until the child comes out.
But if it has not come down, then a woman should be made to vomit with foenugraeum and oil of sesamum.
Then order her to compress herself after the enema, and make her sneeze with a remedy, and hold her nose and mouth for an hour. For a fetus will come out immediately.
If two hands of the fetus come out first, then you should put them back in with ease gradually. But if it does not obey on entering, then put the woman on a seat, and raise her feet up: then bring the seat down to the ground: and let the woman hold, so that she does not fall by the concussion.
But if the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then make an incision, and remove the residue of the fetus: and bind his hand with a cloth, and pull him out by equality: for he will come out.
The exit of the fetus is on its feet. When the fetus comes out on its feet, then you should push them up: then turn the fetus gradually: then make it even.
Then take one of his feet, and stretch it out gradually.
But when they have come out as far as the hips, then order her to compress herself, and make her sneeze with a remedy: for it will come out if God wills.
And if it does not come out with the narration that we mentioned, then you should gradually reduce the fetus, until you put it back in its natural form. For he will come out then with ease of exit.
But if it is prohibited to do all that we mentioned above: then take foenugraeum and oil of sesamum, and gum arabicum: and pound it all together in a mortar with a good pounding: then mix the entire thing with the woman's urine, and insert it into her lower belly. Then make her sit in warm water until she becomes hypersentive.
And so when you see that his lower parts are already warmed, then put myrrh on him and bear him. When the wound has been held for an hour, then make her sit on a chair. Then make her sneeze: and tighten his mouth and nose: and press the lower leg with light compression. For the fire will come out immediately.
Exit the fetus on to the knees and hands. When it has come out in this form, then insert your hands slowly. Then the woman will lie on her neck, and her feet will hang down to the lower parts: and she will lie on a bed, and cross her hands. Then press on her belly slowly. Then pull out what is under her feet from the pubic area, until she is prepared in the lower part. If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet, and move them with a rapid motion. Then press on what is above the navel slowly, until the fetus rises to the upper parts. Then insert your hands, and make the fetus even slower: and instruct the woman to contract, until the fetus comes out.
Exit the fetus hanging downward from the arms. The hands are tight. But if she cannot be reduced, then wash the woman, and make her walk.
But if walking is also impossible, then make her lie on a bed: and strike her thighs with a rapid motion.
Then administer the lubricant you have prepared from mucus.
If she takes it (the lubricant), then make her sit on a chair. Then study the hands for reduction, and make the fetus adopt a natural shape: and instruct the woman to sneeze, and tell her to contract herself, until she comes out.
Exit the fetus on to her neck, with spread arms, and her face is toward the back of her mother's body. It is fitting that the midwife should hold the fetus in her hand, and then rotate it little by little, and equitably with ease.
When, however, it has been brought into equilibrio, then place it on the hollow of her hand that we spoke of before, covered with oil and mucus.
Then command her to move it little by little. When you have done this, then cause her to sit down on a seat, and command her to lean to the right side. Then command her to compress it: and cause her to sneeze with condensed air.
The exit of the fetus prepared on the side. When it descended to the opening of the mother's womb in this manner with the second touch, then cut the second touch with your nail, until it is discharged from the moisture.
But if he should be suspended on the surface of the fetus and its neck, then cut him from the navel: lest he should be retained, and die.
Then push the fetus into the inside, until you put it in the right place: and command the woman to compress herself at times: for he himself shall come out by the exit easily.
The exit of twins, or of a multitude of fetuses. You should know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four. But this is strange, and seldom happens.
But five is a thing outside nature, and do not live long: and they hold them, though they multiply, second by second: and separate them with a scissor, distinguishing between them the ligature in the navel of each one.
And sometimes they go out like a single fetus going out by natural exit, easily: and they go out by a loud exit, as we have described.
That if any of them should be difficult at the birth, and they reach that which we spoke of out of natural figures, then take care of them as we have spoken: and let her lie on a soft bed, and let her do what she does easily and slowly, and dispose herself according to every figure with him who prepares her, leading her to salvation.
Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.
When one is formed in the womb from an embryo, and aborts: sometimes it forms one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten: but I have found that a woman when she aborts, sends out seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
That which is done by the glorious sage in measurement.
This therefore needs to be in the knowledge of obstetrics. Perhaps indeed it will come to that like it: oppose therefore to him what is necessary
Chapter LVII on the head.
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you are troubled about the fetus that is dead along with what I said in the division on medication, and does not come out, and urge to use the operation by hand, then you should consider.
But if the woman is of sound virtue, and is not with any of the accidents from which she fears destruction: then it is necessary that she should lie down on a bed, on her back, and should have her head turned downward, and her legs raised: and the minister should hold her by two parts, or bind her to the bed, so that her body is not taken out with the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with wet oil with mucilage of aloe, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Then let the obstetrics wash her hand with these oils and mucilages: then let her enter the womb with ease. Then she should ask where to place the hook from the fetus, and places convenient for that.
Consider therefore, then if the fetus is prepared to come down on the head: then fix the hooks in her eyes, or in her neck, or in her mouth, or in her palate, or under her beard, or in her throat, or in places convenient for that. Consider that it is necessary that the hook be fixed somewhere, so that she does not come out.
But if the descent is over his feet, then in the chest, and over his ribs with the middle.
And it should be that he holds the hook with his right hand: and he lays his left hand on himself where it is between the fingers: and he inserts it with his hand smoothly, and fastens the hook in some of those places that we said, until he has completed the incision.
Then he should fasten the other hook or a third, if he is able to: so that there is an equality of contraction, and it does not decline on one side.
Then it should be extended with an equal extension, and not only a length along the straight line, but also move on all sides, so that it eases its exit: as happens when the tooth is removed during its erosion.
And it should be in that place where it is between that, so that the extension softens. That if a part of it is retained from that, then the Midwife should put some fingers with oil: and insert them from one side, so that they turn with it what is held back.
But if a part of the baby leaves, then the hooks should be moved to another place that is higher: do this until the whole baby has left.
But if a hand leaves before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it due to its constriction: then it should be covered with cloth. Then remove it until all of it has left, and cut it off or at the plant, or on the bed: and so you should do in the other hand and in both feet.
But if the baby's head is large, or a constriction has occurred during its exit, or water has accumulated in its head: then it should be inserted between the fingers of the Spatumile spike that grows: and he should find with it, and remove the water: or he should cut it off with an instrument called Almisdac: whose shape comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus. Then he should separate the skin with pincers, just as we have said above. Afterward, he should remove the bones with forceps.
If the head has come out and is held by the fork: then seek to find, until the moisture that is in the chest is discharged.
If it is not complicated and does not comply with delivery: then you should make an incision on the head suddenly, according to what is possible for you.
If the lower limb is swollen or there is hydrops in it, then you should make a cut in it, until the moisture that is in it has drained.
But if the fetus is above the feet, then its attraction is easy, and its direction to the mother's mouth is gentle.
If it is held by the windpipe or the chest, then you should remove it with the cloth that you have wrapped around your hand: and seek to find the windpipe or chest, until what is in them has drained.
If other limbs are removed, and then the head returns: then the midwife should insert her left hand. If then the mother' s mouth is open, then the midwife should insert her hand into the depth of the uterus, and seek the head, and attract it with her fingers up to the mouth: then she should insert one hook or two hooks, and attract it with them.
If the mother' s mouth is held back, because of the warm apoplexy that has happened to her: then it is not necessary for her to work on the head, but rather at that time it is necessary to administer an infusion of wet and greasy things: and to administer plaster: and to sit in water that softens and moisten.
If the fetus is above its side, then it is possible to adjust it: then administer what we have said above about the single-foaled cow.
If it is not possible to do this, then incise hastily and remove it.
And it is necessary that you do not leave anything inside at all after the second day.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said in the aphorisms concerning the hot poultices which happen in the wombs.
If blood should flow, then let him descend into the waters of styptic powder, and administer the remaining cure.
And I have already seen a woman, in whom the fetus was dead: then she was impregnated on top of it with another viscrum, and after that another dead fetus was formed. Then happened to her after a long time an aphorism in the navel of her, and it was swollen, until it was opened: and she began to emit pus.
I was called to her cure, and I treated her for a long time: but the wound did not heal.
So I placed over it some strong plasters of attraction: and she came out of the place of the opening. Then passed a few days, and came out another opening. I was therefore surprised from there, when there is no opening in the womb.
I considered, that there were bones of a dead fetus.
I therefore questioned the wound, and removed many bones, with a woman who was in better condition of her health: and now she no longer lived so long a time, and sent out from the place little pus.
And I do not consider this an extraordinary thing, unless there is knowledge and help for it, which the healing artist gives with his hand from the cure.
Head LXVII.
Of Forms Of Instruments Necessary In The Extraction Of The Fetus.
Form of the womb which is opened by the two spirals.
Here is the form of the Strigulator, which are made equal to the books, and to which two twists are attached to the two ends of two pieces of wood. However, this Vertigo should be made less stiff than the strigulator: and to make it so, either of ebony, or of wood of bos.
And the breadth of each of the two limbs is as broad as two fingers; and the border of each limb is as broad as a finger; and the length of each of them is a palm and a half and a half; and in the middle of the two limbs there are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been fixed on both, whose breadth is a half-palm and more a little; and the breadth of each is as broad as two fingers or less.
And these two additions enter into the mouth of the womb, so that it opens with them when you rotate the two spirals.
Other form similar to its, but thinner and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or of cherry, according to the similarity of the forceps. However, in the extreme part of it there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is as broad as a palm; and the breadth of each is as broad as two fingers.
When you open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, hanging her feet from its sides, and Then introduce these two additions joined together into the womb: and you holding the extreme part of the instrument between her hips. Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with the forceps, equally according to the quantity which you wish from the opening of the womb's mouth, until the Obstetrix does what he wants.
Form of the other spiral than that which said the ancient, as it is forced and driven the fetus.
Form of the camel, from whose head comes out the great hump; and is like the forceps, which has teeth at its extreme part, as you see it.
And when it is made round, like the forceps in this form, as you see, which has teeth like a saw, so that it cuts and crushes.
Form A in the hand hold one nail.
Form A in the hand hold two nails.
Form A scalpel having two ends to cut off the head.
Form A two scalpels also holding them in your hands.
These instruments are all used, and the more they multiply in their species, and are prepared by the craftsman's hands, the faster they perform their work, and the higher among men because of their number.
Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, but rather know that it is prepared for you. It is unjustifiable, however, the need for them.
Head 78.
Regarding the extraction of the second part.
When the second part is retained at birth, then you should take the weak one, so that it holds its breath. Then let her sneeze with conditioning: and tightly hold your hand on her nose, and the nostrils of her. If so then she comes out through this, it is good.
If not: then take a stick, and pierce into the cover hole: and put in it herbs opening the mouth of the mother, such as calamus, Rutum, Anetum, Chamomilla, Sesamum, Cassiam linum, and Centauroxylon: take all of these herbs, or some of them, and mix them with water, and put them on fire.
Then place a arrow in the hole of the cover of the pot, and another end in the mother's mouth: and let her hold it until the vapor comes to maturity of the mother.
Then let her sneeze, as we have said. The second part will come out with ease.
If it remains after this care, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil, or mucilaginous aloe. Then he inserted himself into her vagina, and asked her if she was the second one. When he had found her, then he took her, and stretched her out little by little.
But if it [the baby] is attached in the deep part of the womb, then he should insert his hand, according to what we have said above, until he finds the second one, and pulls her out little by little according to the straightness, so that the womb does not break because of a sudden pull: it should be turned over with ease towards the right and left: then add [the quantity] of the pull. But she obeys then, and is pulled out, and is separated from the adhesion.
That if the opening of the womb is constricted, as we have already told: be careful with it during a sneeze, and clean the opening of the womb with herbs after the delivery.
But if she does not come out with all that we have mentioned above, then be careful not to tire yourself out by insisting on the extraction.
But it is necessary that when she comes out from the opening of the womb, there are some tied around the waist of the woman. Then purify her with a tetrapharmacone ointment. But this one will make her rot and dissolve after a few days, and she will come out.
However, when it begins to rot, an evil smell comes out from her towards the stomach and head, and it causes a bad illness. Therefore, it is necessary that appropriate suffumigations are administered to it.
However, there are some ancient ones who have already experienced the suffumigations of mustard and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which the woman is suffumed while retaining the second one and during the menstruation.
Let it be made from wheat like ash or barley and placed over fire; the suffumigation should be placed on plums; hold it, until that suffumigation is consumed; and then take another one.
Chapter LXXIX.
Regarding the treatment of the ano without perforation.
Many boys are born, and their hams are not yet pierced, which has already been cut by the subtle sifac. Therefore, the midwife should pierce that sifac with her finger; and if she does not, she should pierce it herself with a sharp spatemil: and let her take care not to touch it.
Then put over it wool dipped in wine and oil. Then take care of the wound with ointment, until it heals.
But if you suspect that it has been infected, then put a lead pipe in the hole for several days, and remove it when the boy feels like defecating.
And already the boys have become ill because of the infection from the consolidation of the wound, or the formation of pus. Therefore, let that consolidation be removed, and then be cured with it as we have said in the treatment with oil and lead.
Chapter LXVIII.
The Treatment of Fistulas which occur in the lower parts.
The Fistulas which occur in the lower parts are a kind of nodulation and grossness which occurs near the anus: or in a space between one part: and there is one fistula, or several.
But when that nodulation is dried up, it opens, and from it runs out a watery white discharge, or a subtle pus.
And sometimes from these fistulas pass through them. Therefore the penetrating ones are known by that which comes out from defecation, and windiness, when a sick person uses it for defecation: and perhaps it comes out from them in a state of sickness.
And there are fistulas when they penetrate into the space up to the ischial bone, and up to the muscle of the thigh. And there are fistulas which penetrate up to the joint of the hip, and up to a nodule at the tail end.
But from that which is known as a penetrating fistula up to an organ, and also not a penetrating one, it is, when you put your finger of the index into an organ: and when you put in it a subtle sharp instrument made of brass or iron: provided there is no tortuosity.
If there is a twist in it, then insert into it trying from thin lead, or a needle from the hair, until you feel trying, or a needle in your finger.
If you do not feel it well, and there is no discharge, no wind, no dryness as I have said: then you will know that it is not penetrating: therefore go on to the cure.
And when the fistula penetrate to dryness, or to the meatus of urine: then the meaning of it is the exit of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place with medicines hardens.
But if it penetrate to the joint of the hip, or to the mouth of the hip: then the sign of it is that it should reach trying to that place, if there is no twist in it up to the mouth: and the finding of pain on the side, and that it is discharged pus from it always: and that it does not scabs in it with ointment, and hardens.
And in these all-penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is work and uselessness to it from foolish doctors, over whom a form is made.
But in that which is not penetrating, and is not old, there is hope of cure with a bandage: for I tell you, and have proven it: and it is, so that the sick man lies between your hands on his back: and you cleanse the hairs of its legs all the way up to its hips, and its hips are bent towards its belly. Then insert-ing lead, or air, if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where it reaches.
But if he feels it on a certain part, then you should put your finger-tip on the part.
But if you feel in your finger-tip that it has already penetrated through itself on its own, by way of feeling between your finger and the skin, or flesh: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: so do not work in it, for its cure is not with it, as we have said.
They said that he heals certain men of disease by means of a subtle caustic fire applied according to the width of the fistula as described above, and by introducing this fire into the fistula until it reaches a particular place. Then repeat that twice or three times until you are sure that all the added filtered flesh, which is like a feather of an owl, has dried up.
Then treat that with liniment in butter until the flesh comes off, which has dried up: then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh and hardens it.
If he is healed, then it is good.
And if not, then he will never be healed with any other treatment.
And if he emerges with the wound and does not reach as far as your finger, which is in the anus, and there is between it and the tent a thick flesh or sear: and you will see a fistula running along the surface of the skin, then dry off the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and dry out with the tent what is in the fistula until it reaches where the end of the tent has reached, and the tent comes out and falls.
Then clean those filtered flesh, which are like a feather of an owl, so that nothing remains of them.
But if he conquers you with blood, and dissolves between you and your operation as he severs those flesh: then it is better that it should be so, and faster in healing, cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medication.
For the caustic with fire brings good habits together, it dries up the flesh added, and stops the flow of blood, and dries out the moisture.
Then treat that with liniment in butter, or powdered herbs, until the place releases puss, and the added flesh comes off in puss.
Then treat that with an ointment that hardens and generates flesh, until it becomes tough: and there are medications that have stifness and drying out.
When I am hungry, then I eat; and when I am full, then I stop eating.
But if the fistula has reached the depth of the hip and has elongated beyond the confines of the body: then insert your finger into the abdomen and feel it.
But if you feel that there is a defect between you and it, and the defect is of the skin or meat, and is near penetration: then the operation on him should not be done, unless by means of trust and hope.
That is, because it has two ways of being treated: either as you cauterize it, as we have said; or cut it off, until you get the desired result, so that you can put a hook in it, and cure from nearby. And do not proceed much with the cut, lest you fall on a snake that is keeping something in check, and an accident happens to the exit of the body without wanting it. Then the care for that with him which we have said.
Perhaps he will be healed: or he will lengthen the defect, and wash it thoroughly near the hip, as we have said, or with a hook, or with another sharp instrument. Then clean those filthy meats that are in the cut, until you can examine them.
Then try to heal the wound of all the cut, and repair the hole from which the meat has come out: and there remains an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and will be looser than the previous one.
And when this fistula follows this way: and it is when you insert your finger into the fistula: and it is in the back of the hip near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the hip: then take the sharp end of the hook-shaped thing, which is like a needle-thread, according to this form. And insert into it the string wound up into five turns, and around it. Then insert your finger with the thread into the fistula, until you get the desired result of it.
If then there is a piercing into the margin of the anus internally near by, then remove the filament from that hole: so that you can insert your finger in an anum, and remove the end of the filament, and join both ends together: and tighten each one well, and let go of it on the same day or two days: and to the extent that the filament pierces into the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues which are between the two ends of the filament fall down, and then care for the wound, until it heals and consolidates.
If, however, the orifice of the fistula is not piercing: then make it pierce wherever you prepare it for yourself, unless it be in a deep place. For it is not good for you to make it pierce because of the snake, so that you do not hit yourself with it.
Then make it as we have said, until it heals.
Form a hook from the spine where the fistula is found, whose point is sharp and acute very much, and the other part is not acute so that it does not hit that which is unnecessary, as you see.
Chapter LXIII.
From the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and care for wounds.
There are hemorrhoids according to two ways. Or, indeed, they are inside the anus, similar to coal or plums: or almost like grain. And of them there are small ones and great ones: and blood flows from them always, and there is one and many. And they are outside the anus, and at the ends of it.
However, those which are outside the anus, are according to most part few of moisture, from which runs yellow water, or a little blood with a constant course: and they are according to color to that of the body.
And the cure for that which is inside the anus is, as you order to the sick person to sit down: and it is pressed until it comes out from the anus, and appears like a wart on you. Therefore also suspend them with a hook; or hold them with your nail. Then cut them near their roots.
But if they do not hold fast on them because of their moisture and softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a strip from a double-twisted rope, and pull them out with your fingers. Then cut them, and sprinkle over them after the cut some warm poultices so that they stay in place like poultices. Or cauterize them according to what has been said in the chapter on cauterizing. Then take care of them with the remaining cure, until they are healed.
That if the anus of excretion does not obey, then instil into the sick one a small clister, so that it moves with him who is in the anus, and obeys excretion more quickly, when it lets go with the sick one.
But if they are extrinsically located outside the anus, then their condition is lighter, easier: and it is as if you were to hold them with your nail, or with a hook, and cut them. Then take care of them with the above-mentioned method, until they are healed.
And who do not like to be cut with iron, then it is necessary that you administer a suture for them in this way. Take a wadded thread, and insert it into the wound. Then remove the athelils to the top, and make the thread enter into its root on one side: and waddled together the two ends of the thread on the lower part of the needle, and spread them out: and tighten the athelils with a strong knot. Then tie a knot in the thread, and remove the wadded thread.
Make the same for all the athelils, and leave out one: and do not let it be your own flesh, so that it may flow away with an excess of blood.
Then put over a certain cloth soaked in rosewater or cerate, and put the wound on it: and direct the sick person to lie down. Then let go of him, until he falls.
And when the splint has fallen off, care for them with ointment and the other cure, until they are well.
§ On the treatment of fractures. For often accidents happen from the drying up of stool and the tightening of nature.
When they have been so long exposed to the air that there is no longer any benefit to be derived from medicine: then you should shave them with a scalpel, or with your own nail, so as to make them moist, and remove from them the upper cortex which prevents their being consolidated. Then care for them, until they are consolidated according to what is appropriate.
But if they do not consolidate: then examine them again with a keener eye than before, until they bleed profusely, and then care for them, until they are well.
§ On the treatment of scurvy that is caused by lack of salt and of milk, and on scurvy that is caused by flies.
Chapter LIII.
You should know that scurvy is a round nodule of the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail, and it occurs throughout the entire body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes, and causes pain when walking.
Then it should be cut out what is in the shape of a nail, and held with tongs or a pin, and removed from its root.
Then care for it: and if you have a cautery, care for it as was said in his chapter.
But of the scurvy that is caused by flies there is a small eminence, rough, filtered, round, above the surface of the body. And often it happens in the hands of young men.
And its treatment is, that you should spread the splint, and let it fall; or that you should tie it with silk thread; or with wool, until it falls. And if you have a knife, cauterize it according to what has been said above with fire, or with acute medicine: and now the splint is removed from those who are lying down, and from those who are standing with my instrument, which I call.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.
And the cure for it is that you take a tube from the feather of a goose or a strong wattle-bird: and you put that tube on the ant, until it holds the circle of the tube from all parts of it. Then you turn your hand with the tube, until you separate what is in the circumference of the ant: and you put it in the depth of the flesh, and you pluck the ant from its root.
And if you want to, make it with the tube of air or iron, according to this form.
Let the tube sit on the edge of the limit, dragging a sound invisible, so that it alleviates the pressure of the ant and its movement.
And if you want to cauterize the ant according to what has been said in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter LIII.
The Formicas are also instruments that are used to administer enemas for the treatment of diseases of the bird and the relief of pain and swelling.
When the enema is made of silver, or of gold alloy, or of fine brass, or of hammered brass.
And when it is made of these small instruments, and of large ones, according to those in which they are administered.
So what is administered in the cure for young children is small; and for those whose birds are weak or painful, so also are their enemas.
A large enema.
The tube of the ant, that is, the head on which it is tied to the uterine cord, should be wide according to this form: and its edge that is bound to the uterine cord should be like that you see, and its lower end that enters into the womb should be closed, that is, not open, soft, wet, pulling towards delicacy: and there are two holes on one side of it, and a hole on the other side.
And let the width of the hole be according to the breadth of the rays, and let it be more thick or less, and let the uter be that in which they put the medicine out of the animal: or from a sheet of paper, which is according to the form of the little asphyxiated one: whose root is the palm of one hand.
And let it be pierced with many holes as it revolves, and let there be a space which is between all the hole the breadth of the finger. Then introduce into those holes a strong thread from raw fiber, which is made up of ten or more strands, and gather with it the uter like an asphyxiated one. But when this uter is put into it, let a strong knot be tied in the head between two distinguishing marks with strong compression. Then let the knot be drawn up with it.
And this is the shape of the uter here depicted, and of the hole.
The quality of the knot that is to be tied with it is this: that you fill the uter or the medicine out of the animal which is heated according to the tolerance of the nurse: and let it not be very hot or very cold.
Then let the sick person lie on his back and raise his legs to the top: and put it under him, that is, a mattress on which men sleep, or a blanket.
Then let the end of the knot be smeared with oil, or with albus from cheese, or with mucilage from fenugreek, or similar. Then introduce it itself into a hole with ease. Then let the assistant take both of his hands and squeeze it hard, until he has completely discharged what is in the knot into the rectum.
Then remove the knot and raise the sick person's legs against the wall.
If the medicine makes him want to go to the bathroom, then let him hold it as long as he can. And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more of a last resort.
But if you tie him in the solutions of the six-day illness, and hurry about his discharge: then repeat the knot, until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or pain in the anus, then sit in a subtle bath, lazily, from the baths with which boys are bathed.
And this sit in a subtle form of the bath on which is a strict skin.
Curationem vulnerum capiti, quae non sunt fractam ossibus crinis, curamus ut sub iudice iterum.
I have already said in the division of the cure of the wound that it was appropriate to provide treatment with a book, and I say here that we will treat these with the hand and with doctors according to a second remedy.
I say, therefore, that wounds differ according to the one in which they occur, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Therefore, the wounds that are often caused are like blows of a stone; or a cut of a knife, or a blow with an arrow, or a piece of wood, or a bolt; and similar things from many other causes.
However, wounds that are located on different parts of the body are like a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or thigh: and similar things from their members.
And I am telling about the cure of some wounds, so that I set forth the reason and rule also for the remaining wounds.
I will begin with simple wounds on the head: because I will recall the composer's memory at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say, therefore, that: When it has happened in the head a simple wound, and is not a fracture of bone: consider then, if it has been from a blow of a stone, or similar, and already has broken the skin only: and is a great wound, and fear for possible painful apostemata: therefore hurry, and perform phlebotomy on the head immediately: and do not tarry with this: and draw out his blood according to the strength of its virtue: if it were not prohibiting anything from phlebotomy, especially if it were blood that comes out slowly from the wound. And let the bloodletting be done from the opposite side of the wound.
And let the bloodletting be done from the opposite side of the wound. And let the sick person abstain from eating too much, wine, and coarse food.
But if moderation is required, then he should be slightly reduced from food, and not come near meat, nor wine.
And place on the wound if it happens that he has a hot pustule, a lukewarm infusion in oil of rosewater, or with wine in which there is stinging nettle.
But if you are safe from a hot pustule, then place on the wound if it is still fresh with its own blood, and has not been changed by air, the powder that I will describe after a little while: and if the air has already changed it, then place on the wound some unguent until it heals.
But if the wound is large, or made by a cut of an instrument, and not gathering together by pustules, then join it with sutures, as I will describe in wounds of the leg concerning their sutures.
But if the wound has already touched bone, and hangs down, and there is no support of it except by a small suspender: then cut it. Then take care of the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh instead of skin, and order the sick person to eat food which is free from excess, such as are heads of animals, and cooked wheat, until it has become a pulse, and eat such things.
That if the wound is putrefied in the skin, and does not hold to the bone: then cut off the whole putrid part, and throw it away: then take care of that.
But if there is an artery in these wounds, or a new one from which blood flows: and does not stop by medicines, then inquire about the artery. But if you do not cut the wound, then dry it with a sponge or bind it up. That if necessity compels you to do so, when the above is not granted, then burn it until blood stops flowing.
But if these wounds are small and simple, then the cure of them is easy and light: so that we can sprinkle powder on them now; for they are consolidated before they change with air.
The method of making incisions in a powdery form. Take a part of incense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of non-extinguished chalk: mix all together well, and strain it; and fill it with powder, and bind it tightly so that it sticks well to the wound, and congeals with blood.
Then tie the powder on top of the wound with thread, and do not remove it until it has dried, so that it does not peel off. For the medicine will not be eradicated from it until it is healed.
But when the chalk has done its work by itself, which it will do if you have no incense present, and dragon' blood also does the same operation on many large wounds, when it is laid on them and bound up, and their own blood, which has not changed with air,
For if it has been slightly altered by air at all, especially when it is in the summer season, then this powder's intention is not in position: so therefore cure this wound with that ointment which I have mentioned, or put on it a poultice made of wheat flour, made with water and honey, until it discharges pus. Then care for the remainder of the wound with ordinary care, until they are healed.
But if there is a broken bone in the jaw, and it is small, then extract it with forceps: for I will tell you about the cure of broken bones in the head.

But if a wound has occurred in the throat, there is no difference between it and any other wound when the cure comes from within, and between a simple wound of the head.
But if the incision has already been made on the nerve of the neck or artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, unless it is cured with it so that it makes severe constriction, like ziniar and zegi and things similar to them. For these harm the nerves, and turn them away from their course.
And do not place anything cold upon a wound at all: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuance is with the brain, which is above the members: and let this be healed by medicines with lene, as the calx is mixed with sweet water sometimes with oil or rose-oil, and also with tuthium, when it is washed away also with sweet water; and the other mineral stones, in this way, and oiled oils.
But if the wound is large, then apply a stitch: or cover its lip with powder. Then take care of yourself, until it heals.
But if the wound is deep, or has a pocket of pus on the lower part of it: then pierce it in a more depressed place in it.
That if the incision is on the nerve of an artery and its blood flow is followed: then separate it, or dry it up, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity compels to do so.
But if the incision is on the spine and has been there a long time, and it seems that it will not heal: then join the skin together with a stitch above the sink, and do not touch the sink, but make it come back to its natural shape. Then tighten it with a tightening that diminishes gradually, and let it alone for some days. Then take care of yourself with ointments which relieve the itching and drying, until it heals.
But if the wound has made an impression on the bone: then examine it: then if there are any fragments of bone in it, take them all out, or as many as you can: and what is not prepared, let it alone, until the wound putsrefies, and separates itself, and grows loose.
If the fracture is recent, then apply a powder over the wound that you have prepared. But if it is a bone that has come out and become a fistula: then treat it with what comes with the memory of its treatment in its own chapter.
On Ulnary Bones in Spatulas.
If there is a puncture from a spear or a knife, and you can see its depth, then consider carefully. But if there is a discharge from the ulna, and it begins to dry up, then know that it is a fatal fracture.
If it is not deep and is recent with its blood: then do not put powder on it at first, nor bind it so that the blood does not flow into its depth, and return to the heart, and cause injury: but put on a liquid ointment and loosen it by day twice.
But if you do not have ointment with you, then put a wet cloth on the ulnar wound so that it sucks out what comes from it by moisture: and let the patient sleep on the fracture so that he does not stir up what has gathered in it.
But if three or more days have passed since the fracture and no spasm has occurred in the limb, nor any bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and the remaining symptoms are good: then know that the ulna is healed. Then care for it and with care, and with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
But if the healing has been completed and it has opened up for good, then know that it has already become a fistula. Then care for it from its own chapter.
And if the bone is from an incision of a sword or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the back, or of the neck: then treat it with what preceded it from the stitch, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
But if he has already made an impression on the bone and it has come out of it, then inquire about the tuberosities, and approach to remove those frusta if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then let them be left alone until the tuberosities rot away, for the extraction of those is a relief.
But the remains of wounds and accidents in the remaining members are a judgment in the cure, which is the judgment I have mentioned.
[Concerning] wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and the happening of those things.
The disruption that has happened to the belly is great, middle, and small.
From a great one, then, when and how many intestines go out,
Why does that intrusion happen, and why the suture of those things is more painful and difficult.
And a small disruption also happens to be difficult from another mode. Follows, then, that if you do not approach the intrusion of its own accord immediately to its place: for it swells up, opens up, and thickens up: why is it difficult to enter?
For this reason, then, a great disruption is more beneficial than a small one: for when it is not difficult to reduce the intestines, as it is in these two cases.
Know that the suture of the belly is according to four ways.
The two common sutures meet together in the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the remaining parts of the wound; and the other two peculiar sutures communicate with each other to the rest of the wounds. However, there are more proper when it is the suture of the belly: and I tell you one at a time with explanation and description.
I say, that when the bone is small, and something comes out of it from the intestines, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is because of one or both of these two ways. Or because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said: or because there is inflation in the intestines because of cold air.
When therefore that is so, then it is necessary that you should warm him, so as to submerge the sponge, or a wet cloth in warm water. Or you shall boil him in water with squinants, and cypress, and pepper, and bruise it with the entrails, until the swelling be resolved.
When therefore that wine in which is stipticitas: and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflammation.
When therefore you see that inflammation be already resolved, then wet the entrails with water in which has been boiled the above-mentioned, or sour them. For by this the entrance shall be soothed with the medicine.
If however there be a return of the disease after this cure, then find in breaking up a little, with an instrument wherewith the hemorrhoids are torn.
And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than the cutting: and there is no necessity to force at the second operation, nor want of instruments.
Let one part of him which is bent, acute, and the other part which is not acute, and the extremities are a little less acute than the middle, and let it be somewhat like the knur, as you see.
When therefore the wound is enlarged, and the entrails are drawn in, then it is necessary that there be a retrenchment of them after their own nature, in their own place, if it may be done over that: for it is better.
When therefore the rupture is wide in the lower part of the thigh: then it is necessary that you should lie the sick person on his back, and raise his legs with his head. And if it be in the upper part of the thigh, then let his head and his breast be higher than his lower parts.
And likewise if the rupture be in one side of the thigh only, then let your intention and your attention always be upon this, that part which is hurt be higher on one side than on the other.
And thus it should be, that you may apply to the wound, both great and small.
But in small wounds, place it according to how you have prepared it.
Then make it present between your hands the faithful server who shall hold all the incision with his hand, and add the lips. Then detect from it he who follows, something to suture after something: and this is the manner of common suturing one.
And it is, so that you take it up, or number it up according to the quantity of width of wound. Then let go from the extreme of incision quantity of finger ring, that is, measure: and fix now one than you put into it in two extremities skin, with two extremities siroc which is under skin from inside, until you make it penetrate from other side, and you have already added two extremities skin, and two extremities siroc: and there are four orders.
Then tighten with double thread around the acuse from both parts at the same time, until two lips of wound have been added by descent aggregation.
Then let go roughness of finger and also fix in them other than: then make it straight with thread, as you did with the first one. Not therefore cease to do it with him whom you carry from the acube, until you complete constriction of wound all.
And let there be acuse middle between roughness and thinness: for the acuse that are thin very quickly cut flesh: and gross are difficult entry into skin: therefore it is necessary that they be middle in thinness, and in roughness.
And it is not necessary, that the acuse be fixed in two extremities skin near: so that flesh does not quickly cut, and wound opens before its consolidation, and also do not lengthen with suture, so that wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Then cut off the end of acuses, so that they do not hurt patient at his sleep: and put feathers from all sides, which hold extremities of acuses: and let go them, until you know that wound is already consolidated.
And this type of stitch with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds. Since one, or two, or a certain number of needles are sufficient to sew them up.
But the second common stitch is to bring together the ends of four layers: the ends of two skin layers and the ends of two fat layers in one line, with a needle in which the thread is equal in thickness and subtlety, and
Then, when you pierce with the needle these four ends, bring them together from the part from which you began, so that the thread is stretched from the upper part of the wound: so that the stitch will be like a stitch in a piece of cloth when it is sewn, and place between each stitch the amount of thickness of the little finger.
This type of stitch is known by men.
And with this stitch I sewed up a wound in the man's abdomen, which had been cut with a knife, and the injury was about a palm wide: and about two palms of intestinal tissue came out from the middle intestine, and the damage was in the center of his groin.
Then I reduced it after he had stood for twenty-two hours.
So the wound healed in a space that had been for about fifteen days: and I nursed him, and he recovered: and after that he lived for many years, living in his own affairs.
And the doctors judged that he would not heal.
And it was a miracle that I healed him with ointment. Since I was in a place where the ointment was not available, and there were no medicines. Then I laid a cotton swab wet with balm on the wound twice a day, and I bathed it with honey water until it healed.
I will mention two kinds of stitches according to the account of the speech.
And it is, as you begin with the acute stitch: and introduce the needle from the outside to the inside part.
When the needle then enters the skin and goes according to the length and width of the whole body: release one end of the sifac to the side where you inserted the needle, and let the other end be pulled through from the inside to the outside at the other end.
But when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extreme end mirach from the external part to the internal: and dismiss the extreme end sifac, which is in this side, and make it penetrate now in the other extreme end from the internal part to the external: and make it penetrate with your penetration, which you do make it penetrate in the sifac extreme end mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates into itself all.
Then also from this same side, and with the same end, take it out of the skin where it has penetrated: and now take out what has penetrated with your hand.
Then reduce it again into that skin, and with the same end take the sifac extreme, which is in the other side, with this mirach end: and take out of that skin what is from its part, and make that one move, and the other not: and make that one move after the other, until they are all outside according to that example.
And the top of this stitch is so that its stitch joins the skin together: so that its one end comes out from one part of the skin: and that you dismiss its other end from the other part, until it is completed.
Second kind of stitch, which Galen named.
This speech was told as if their stitch was similar to that of certain physicians who make them come together in a way that is appropriate to nature: and they apply the sifac end to one end of it, and the mirach end to the other end of it. And this one does as I tell you.
It is necessary that you make it penetrate now in the mirach end which is near you from the external part, and make it penetrate into it on its own: and dismiss the two ends of the sifac. Then turn it around now, and make it penetrate from the external part to the internal in both ends of the sifac, that is, on each side.
Then turn it around both of them, and also make penetrate both of them from the internal to the external, in two ends of the mirach which are on the other side:
And this method of縫 is better than the common one that is easy to make and is the sutura whose predecessor was remembered.
This is therefore also the speech of Galen.
And said someone: The sutura of the hand is corrected with two needles. That is, so that you enter them both with one thread: and begin with the insertion of the needle, on account of that which is with you, and let it penetrate as far as the other side, according to the sutura of their bones which are equal.
And you shall know that when the rupture is in the middle of the hand: then the sutura of it is more difficult than that of the other places of the hand.
The judgment of the medicine of the wound, is the judgment of the other wounds.
That is, because when you make a fresh wound with its blood, before it is altered by air: and reduce the intestines, and their own substance, and make them fit: then put on the dust of the incisions.
That is, if the air has already altered the wound: then put on the wound a certain ointment which is present with you, until it makes the pus: and let the threads fall away, and be hardened by the sinew, and be cured. Then that care which I have described is like the care of the other wounds, until it is healed.
If, however, you do not have at hand the medicine which I have described, then put on the wound as soon as it begins to emit pus, and keep changing it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
For you would not have need of other medicine in many dispositions, when the wounds are simple.
If, however, you are in a place where the wound communicates with the principal members of the body in the injury, then you should dip the wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil: and put it on the places which are between the hips, and under the armpits.
That is, if it feels pain, or twitches, or has putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens) then you shall use the laxative medicine with wine which is black and warm: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestines, and there is pus penetrating as far as the root.
And you should know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal; and what is from them is subtle, harder to heal.
But the intestine which is called the jejunum does not receive healing from the wound which has occurred in it at all; and that is because of its multitude, being from veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the nearness of its nature of nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is scanty, and you make it few: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
But if, on the other hand, there has been a space left for it, and it has already become dark, or black: then you should bind it with thread above the place which has become discolored, so that blood does not flow. For in them are veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and put two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside the intestine: so as to alleviate its attraction for you, and its extraction at the edge of the dark, and the emission of pus from the wound.
Remembering the wound which happened in the intestine.
When there has been a rupture in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible, that it should be restored in some men; because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with the thrust of a lance, and it was a wound on the right side of his stomach, and it was old wound: and it made a fistula, and discharged entrails, and had wind.
So I applied treatment, until I was not confident in his healing; and I did not persist in examining him, until he had healed, and the site had consolidated.
After I saw the place now consolidated, I was afraid of disease, that might happen to him in his belly: and it did not happen to him from that accident. And he remained in the best of his dispositions, eating and drinking, and enjoying himself, and entering a bath, and exercising in his diet.
And already some experimenters had said, for when it happens in the intestino a ulnus, and is small: then it should be bound according to this manner. And is, that you take the ants of great heads. Then gather two lips of the wound, and put one ant of these which have an open mouth on two lips of the wound. And when this head is over her, and strings his mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres, and does not unbind itself.
Then put another ant near the first one, and you do not cease to make it with the ant after the quantity of the wound of all this.
Then reduce him, and his wound. That head remaining annexed in the intestino, until it feeds on the intestino, and heals, and does not happen to cause a deep wound of harm.
And it is possible that the intestino is bound also with a fine thread: which is taken away from the intestino animal, annexed with it as soon as it enters into the acum.
And is, that you take the end of this thread out of the intestino, and much flesh is cut off. Then bind on the end of this thread with a fine wrapped thread. Then introduce that thread into the acum, and follow it with the intestino. Then reduce him in a disruption.
And this way of sewing with ants and intestines is not but second to the first one of trust and hope.
You know that the wound which is great and broad, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then is not but a subtle art, nor is its healing at all complete.
Of the care of Zuzechim, and Fistulas.
You know that every wound, or old bruise when it has healed and dried up, and turns into a sore, and does not close up, and always discharges pus, and does not heal: then is called universally in any member whatever, and we call this same thing Zuzechim.
And a fistula is indeed the nodulation of a filtered, hard, white wound; when there is no pain, but there are tender, delicate ears; and for that reason some call it a risa, that is, an ear.
And it is in certain hours humid, which discharges pus. And perhaps it splits into two in certain hours. And when this humidity is much, and there is little: and it is thick, and it is fine.
And I have already prejudged in the division, then when I said wounds, that every wound which does not heal, and does not grow in it flesh, is not that unless for a new cause of diseases.
Of which one is because there is little blood in the body; or because of a malice of it; or because between itself and over its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh; or because it is very dirty and full of filth; or because the wound is putrid inside, and the matter it sends out is of bad quality; or because the medicine is incompatible in its cure; or because corruption falling into the region is a kind of pestilence, or because by virtue of the region, as happened in Caesar Augusta: for in that place it is difficult to digest ailments, and the healing is slow of boils by nature; or because there is only one opening, or a number of bones.
And I have already shown all the causes and signs of these wounds, and the cures of them with physicians in a division: and it is necessary here that I should tell you the cure of the Fistula and the Zieken, which is done by the way of an operation with the hand.
Know therefore that a fistula happens in all parts of the body. For these are the fistulas which penetrate into large veins and arteries, or nerves, or intestines, or rectum, or any of the spinal bones, or any of the joints of the body by composition: such as hands, and feet: and from those arise fistulas which pierce into the proximity of the principal member, and the like.
What is said here about these fistulas is that from this point of view they are difficult to cure, and do not respond to treatment, and the occupation with them is work and ignorance.
If, however, there is any fistula the depth of which does not reach these places that I have mentioned: and you hope and trust in its healing, and examine it with care, then accept a trial from brass or iron, if the fistula tends to straightness, and investigate it along with itself.
If, however, there is any fistula that has tortuosity, then investigate it with a thin lead wand. For lead gently alleviates the pain of its own body, and deals with tortuosity.
Since if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate on it with a lead wand. So examine the openings from the openings themselves.
For because of the moisture that clisterizes itself, it turns towards other openings, and runs out of them.
Then inquire carefully about how it is possible for you to recognize: so that you can know whether there is an opening or a nerve, and the fistula runs far away or near: or there is one fistula whose openings are many, and it stands over all of it, with your greatest care: with your questioning, which you ask about the sick, and the discovery of pain when pressing with your hand on the place, and similar indications and causal accidents apostemated.
Then stand with a true station while you are doing all this: then move towards healing in accordance with confidence: and is, when you consider then, if it is a nearby fistula that appears, or in a place far away from the joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places that I mentioned to you: then dry up the fistula according to what has been premised in my narration, and remove whatever is in it from filtration, and corrupted meats, which is born in the opening of it from flesh, or the sinew, and similar things: and heal it, until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth and straight: then it is necessary to separate it as much as you can in the depth. Then clean it completely of all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply the poultice of liniment infused with acute medicines: and insert it as far as the fistula you have contained with iron: do this several times, until the acute medicine has completely corroded what remained in the fistula's concavity from the corruption.
Then restore it with unguent that generates healthy flesh, until it heals.
But if it does not heal through this, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
But if the cause of the fistula is an opening, and it is confirmed by you that it is: then examine the opening, and stop up the opening according to what I have told you: if it does not prohibit from any of new tissue, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
But if an opening is detected by you, and there is in it some corruption, and blackness: then shave it, until the whole corruption is removed. Then care for the flesh with that which generates flesh, until it heals.
That if it does not heal, and it discharges pus as it used to: then know that you have not achieved the total eradication of the corruption.
Then detect on it again after the second day, and examine whether it can be shaved, and clean it with your last strength.
Then restore it. But if it heals, that is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is in a remote depth of the body, which you have not achieved. It is therefore not in your power to do this, unless you leave it to nature.
But if the corruption is in a small opening, and it is possible for you, attract it with subtle forceps which are appropriate for it.
But if there are many bones: then examine whether you can attract them all, and do not let go of any of them with your strength.
If, however, you find a resistance from the humidities and there is no fear or mistake in incising them, then incise those humidities and flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones at your own hour, then place over the limb that it may rot itself: and leave it, until it has rotted what is in the surroundings of its bones from the flesh and humidities.
And guard the limb so that it does not consolidate. And constrict the section which you followed in your operation. Then place over the limb, if you wish, drowned in sulfur twice with oil: or once drowned in Egyptian ointment, or some other ointment.
For when those humidities putrify, and the bones separate from them, the removal of them is eased, and their attraction is removed.
But if there is one large bone, such as a femur, or a pelvis, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part, then shave the limb with the last razor, until the corruption and blackness are removed. Then restore the limb.
But if what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw the limb, and incise it all the way to the point where the corruption reaches: then care for the limb, until it has consolidated.
And I will tell you the story of a man who suffered on his leg: so that it may be an example and help for your operation.
He was a young man of about thirty years of age, to whom pain came in his leg, from some matter moving within the body, that is, from the inside, until it reached the limb, and there was an ulcer great enough. And there was no external cause.
So he stayed with that error of the doctors for a long time, until the ulcer opened, and many substances entered with it. And after that, his cure is to be delayed until his hand is healed, and many openings are made in it; all of which discharge pus and body moisture.
So he was treated by a number of doctors for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of his hand until I came; then I saw his hand and the matter that was coming out of those openings with great flow: also all his body was gangrened, and his color had turned yellow.
So I inserted my hand into one of the openings, and it came to the mouth.
Then I scrutinized all the openings, and I found them all coming together on one side of his hand.
Then I removed, and I followed one of those openings, until I found the bone part: and I found it corroded: which was already rotten, and decayed, and pierced, until it penetrated to the marrow.
So I cut off what I had detected, and I prepared it from corroded bone.
And I removed, for there was nothing left in the bone but that corruption, which I cut off and sharpened. And so I had removed it.
Then I placed a patch of dry wound with long-consolidated medicine. But it was not consolidated.
Then I tried again, and I found on top of the bone a second time: and I found a continuous corruption with the bone, and I sharpened what seemed to me also from that corruption.
Then I tried to restore it. But it was not restored.
Then I detected again on top of the bone, and I did not cease to strike the bone little by little, and to try to restore it: and it was not restored until I struck out of the bone near the palm, and I took it out with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicine, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed; and this iteration in its operation, and cutting, was not necessary unless for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and my fear of it from death: for it happened to him at all times from a bad syncope of discharge.
The patient is therefore completely healed: and the new bone has grown in place, and his body has been made sound, and his strength has returned; and he has recovered in his powers: and he has recovered in his dispositions: and he has not done him any harm in walking at all.
But if the jaw is broken in a place in the body where it has already been broken: then it should be fixed, in this way: that you take a ligament, and tie it tightly at the end of the bone; and command someone who will stretch it upwards: and put another ligament, from a coarse wool, after the first one. Then bind the bone over the flesh, which is between the bones: and extend its end so that you can pull the flesh down towards the bottom: and you cover the flesh over the place where you want to fix it, so as not to hurt the flesh when you cut it.
Place a piece of wood or a board under the bone below: because when you do that, the flesh is not hurt, if you don't cut it.
And it should be fixed over the corrupted place a little, so that there is no concern about the bone's corruption; and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compels his own fixing force by means of another ligature.
Which if the bone is corrupted and is not prominent, but continues with a part of it: and corruption is in its middle, or in one of its parts: then you cover all the flesh from all the parts. Then place a piece of wood below.
Then fix that from the first part where there is corruption, until it continues with a fixing force from the other part: and let the fixing force be a little longer according to what we have said.
Which if corruption is in a joint, then cut that joint which is corrupted, and fix the bone where it continues from the other part.
But if corruption is in the continuation of two joints: then there is no power there except for a cut.
Which if corruption is in the hand's palm, or in the foot's sole: then the matter is difficult and hard. Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter apareat tibi. And after that, you should cut off the part and clean it up in whatever way is possible for you and adjust it with the right tool: when it does not create a contrary vein or nerve.
And you should know that there are many chisels and saws to cut these bones, according to the arrangement of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety, and size, and smoothness, and hardness, and their rarity. Therefore, you should prepare the right tool for every type of surgery that suits that operation.
And know that these operations require a long study with the instrument you are holding when performing them. And the knowledge of these methods of the art is a witness to the methods of diseases: for then you will already find out through yourself what suits him from tools for any disease.
And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of tools, which are given as examples of what to cut, and a proof of what you have experienced on other things.
The shape of another saw.
The shape of the rasp is joined. Let the head of this rasp be in the form of a star-shaped claw: and its points be in the form of star-shaped dots.
And it does not suit unless you rub it with the heads of rasps when they are worn out, or a wide and large mouth, and is great.
The shape of a larger rasp.
The shape of a broad rasp.
The shape of a raspberry that is closed up.
Form of a sharp razor.
Form of the curved end of a sharp razor.
Form of a thin, sharp razor blade.
This is similar to a file, and the end is like an axe: it is shown in many places in the dissection of bones.
Form of a razor that fits close to its cut which has been made through bone.
The end of it is triangular, and its ends are acute.
Fit from India. And likewise it should be, that all which we have said of razors, and of chisels, and of saws, may be.
Of the incisions on the ends, and of the fitting of the bones with saws.
The ends putrifie, either by an external cause, or an internal one.
But when you have cured it with medicine, and there is no cure; and you see corruption coming to a limb, where it does not affect anything: then you should cut that limb all the way to where the corruption comes in, so that the sick one may be cured of his malady which is greater than the defect of the limb.
And the sign of what happens to that is, that the limb becomes discolored, until it is cured: for if fire burns it, or putrefaction comes after corruption: until corruption enters into that which follows that limb, and spreads through all the body.
Then it is proper to cut the limb with care, and in like manner if the cause of corruption is from an external impact from some of the venenous ones: such as the sea scorpion, the bee, the nettle, and others similar to them.
But if corruption or an impact is on the end of a finger, then cut that finger, and do not leave space for corruption, so that it may go all the way to the other hand.
And likewise if it has happened in the hand, then cut that hand from the root of a sharp axe, and do not leave space for corruption, until it reaches the length of a short arm.
And if you have penetrated into it, then cut the arm at the elbow joint.
But if corruption has already taken hold, and you see it all around the elbow: then death is upon that limb. And apart from this cure, a certain amount of strength is required.
And likewise do for the foot, when corruption has penetrated into a toe, then cut it at the joint: and if it enters the shin, then cut the whole leg. But if it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
That if corruption has already reached above the knee, there is no hope of recovery, except for amputation and surrender to death by leaving it to die.
And the way to cut the limb off, or to sever it is, when you want to tighten the ligaments lower down, which you want to cut: and tighten another ligament above the spot. And stretch out one minister's ligament downward: and stretch out another minister's ligament upward. And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with your spatulum, until all the bone is exposed. Then cut it, or sever it.
And you should place a linen cloth over all parts, so that the saw does not touch the sound bone: and it happens to the sick with added poultice and warm plasters.
But if blood flows inward while you are working, then cauterize the spot quickly: or put some powder on it to stop the flow of blood. Then return to your own medication, until it is finished.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament, and take care of it, until it heals.
And I will tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same thing that I am telling you.
That is, because it happened in his black foot, with the heat that is like the burning of fire: and that corruption first began in a toe, until it covered the whole foot.
Therefore the surgeon took a knife from its case, after he saw corruption come upon the member with its movement, which he found out from pain and its warmth; and he cut it himself at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time had passed, that same corruption happened to him again in his index finger of his hand.
Then he came to me, and I tried to restore that excess with him when I put on his hand from the medicines after purifying his body: and the excess did not respond, and it began to heal in another finger: until the corruption began in his hand.
So he called me to cut his hand: but I did not want to do so, hoping from myself for a response to that excess: and I was also afraid of death at the cutting of his hand by incision. For the power of the finger was above death.
And after he had despaired of me, he turned back to his land: and he came to me about it, because he hoped, and he cut off all his hand: and he was healed.
And I did not bring this account except to be an aid against that which falls from the kind of this disease: and to be a sign what signifies, and according to what is concerned.
On the treatment of gangrenous wounds, and the quality of cauterization with medicines.
When a gangrene happens in some fleshy member, and the space of the gangrene is prolonged, until it does collect blood: then it breaks, or pierces, and what is in it comes out, and there remains a hollow place like a wound, and the skin over it is like thin cloth: and it does not come to its last corruption, nor impresses into the bone, nor the nerves, nor the ligaments: it deserves to be called a Sinus: but it is not called a Fistula: nevertheless if it prolongs its space, until it impresses the corruption in some of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or a zak-o-kain.
And the cure is such that you strike off all of the skin like a wrapper; and above all when it has become thin, and made like a blanket; and put trust in it because it would not adhere to the place, for its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and does not result from it that corruption: and if there is a thickness of flesh, then the cure itself with Cantharis: and is, as you consider to the sinew.
Then if it is great, and the pus that is discharged from it is foul-smelling: then cantharis itself with a medicinal substance, which is vinegar, oil, and saffron, parts receiving equal portions, mixed together in a vessel: and boiled on fire, until it turns red: and comes to a thickness of honey.
Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and cantharis with it to the sinew: and tighten the opening of it, and let the medicine into it for a period of two hours.
Then extract it with an expression: make it for days, until the sinew is cleared away, and the smell is removed.
And when cantharis is made with water of ash, when this medicine is not present with you: and is, that you take ash from wood of oak, or ash from oak-tree: and pour it on water. Then strain it, and cantharis with it, until you put trust in that the sinew is now washed away.
That if the tolerance for the Egyptian medicine is not strong, nor for water of ash, then cantharis itself with water and honey, which has already been mixed with crushed saffron. Or cantharis itself with honey and wine, mixed, for the property of honey is to purify, and to wash away: and wine makes the sinew adhere, especially when there is an abundance of astringency and dryness in it.
How often do you perform this operation and trust that the sinus is now healed: then clean him out with a syringe as he performs the operation to give birth to flesh in it.
And so that you may receive the embalming paste: and dissolve him with rose oil, and with wine astringent: or clean him out with certain medicines, and with other ointments, whose properties I have written in the book of ointments.
That if the opening of the sinus is narrow, in which the syringe does not enter: then widen it slightly with a bit of iron: or put in it licorice soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it widens.
And likewise if the opening is also wide, then join the lips together with a stitch: and let go from it a quantity in which the syringe enters without addition.
And likewise if the opening from which there runs pus is elevated towards the top: then dry it out in a lower place that is in it so that the pus runs down from it: for when pus is confined in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being born in it.
That if you are not able to dry out the sinus all around its lower part according to what you wish: then try to prepare the member in such a way that the pus runs from it easily according to how you prepare it for yourself. Consider that you do not retain anything of the pus at all in it: and take medicines that are used to put on the spot, fitting for what you wish. And extend them over a linen cloth. And have such a quantity of the cloth so that it communicates with all of the sinus. Then cut with forceps into the direct opening of the sinus hole, making a slightly larger opening of the sinus. Then extend from the ointment a thin cloth over another cloth according to the quantity of the hole: and place it on the member at a distant position from the opening of the sinus so that the exit of pus from it is aided: and do not remove the large cloth, unless after a few days.
And yet he who is super orificium sinus, is he whom you move at all times, so that he goes out what is gathered in him from pus: and know ye, that the virus which runs out of it, is much, or little: or digested, or indigested.
And when ye consider again the place of the sinus itself, do ye not see that the lord feels pain in it, or is there no pain in it? and is there an apostema or not?
When therefore your treatment extends thus far, and ye see the matter which runs out on the orifice of the sinus, then know that the sinus is already attached, or approaches to attachment: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or in the third day: and when ye dissolve the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the unguent.
But if the virus runs out of the sinus after a long space of time, then do not despair concerning its attachment, because its healing approaches, since there are persons who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and from them come those who act in the opposite way.
But if it runs out after many days of putrid matter, then know that the sinus does not attach.
But if the attachment of the sinus is prolonged and its matter is dried up: then let physicians add to it in their medicine so that they make it moist in its substance, and in its virtue dry: as the unguent of daphno, when added thereto an excess of addition out of myrrh.
And from the greatest last which is cured, is it that ye take the unguent of daphno, and dissolve it with rose-oil, and it runs over on the old sinuses equalling its substance.
Then bind the unguent to the sinus, and use it.
And this same action is similar when ye have not present to you the unguent of daphno, but ye have with you honey, when ye boil it up, and use it. Take myrrh and aloe and olive oil; and let them all be crushed together, and put that powder on honey as it comes out of the fire. Then spread a sheet over the wound, and tie it tightly around the sinus; and spread the powder on the wound, and put it on the sheet, and tie it tightly.
And when the long arhatolgia is administered to it, and the roots of the star lily, and there is a lily; and flour from grass, and daisy. Use them simple, or crushed, spread it out, and the powder itself: and put that honey which you have made, and use it.
If the sinus does not heal with this treatment, then you shall know that there is corruption in its depths: or it has already made an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or on the ligaments: then treat the sinus with fistular cure, according to what has been stated.
Of the cure of paronychia and of the grinding of the nail, and of the incision of the finger added, and of the section.
Paronychia is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb or any other finger, and perhaps it arises in the other fingers too.
When it is prolonged and neglected, and left without treatment, and becomes an abscess with a hot poultice: or itrotts and discharges pus, until it corrodes the nail root: and perhaps it corrupts all of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the mouth, until it gives off a foul odor: and makes the end of the finger swollen, and its color is black.
When you then treat the sinus with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not bring about a cure: then you must cut off all the excess that remains from the nail. Then cauterize the wound after it. For the cautery is very hot.
But if the mouth is sound, and the nail also is sound, and the additions of the nail are already pressing inwards the flesh towards its interior, and they begin to sting it, and hurt it: then you must place a very fine radium under the angle of the nail that hurts the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut into the flesh easily, and put on top of it what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, from corrosions, until all of it is removed. Then that care with ointment, until it heals.
If however the corruption has already sunk deep into the palate, then one should break open that palate and take it out: for it is never healed while the corrupted palate remains in it.
If you see corrosion and corruption entering into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to the above-mentioned reminder. Then care for that wound, until it heals.
If however there is an injury from scraping or striking: and there is sharp pain, then one should let the blood of that person first. Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across from above to the wound.
And guard it, so that the cut does not go down into the flesh below the nail, for you will cause to happen through it a very painful pain in the sick one, and it will be a cause of the birth of flesh added in place.
Then care for that place with what sits and has pains.
The finger however that is added which is born in some hands of men, perhaps is flesh all over: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and the birth of some of their joints, or is born in some of their joints. So this which is born in some joints of the finger does not move: and this which is born at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Therefore that flesh from which it is easy to cut, their section is easy. That is, so that you break open it at its root with a spatula of a flat edge.
But the care of that which is born in the root of a joint, is difficult. Therefore abstain from cutting it.
In that finger however which is born at the last joint, then one should break open its first flesh all the way to the mouth. Then close the mouth with one of those sharp things that are convenient for closing it. Then the cure of himself, until he is healed.
The consolidations that happen to the fingers together, often happens or from birth of man, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from burning fire, and similar things.
Therefore, it should be that you separate that consolidation, until the fingers regrow their natural form. Then place between them a piece of linen, or rags soaked in rose water: so that they do not come together quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin lead plate, until the site consolidates as needed.
And likewise, if the consolidation of some fingers with the palm, then dry that consolidation, according to which it is prepared and suitable for the member's form.
De incisione:
Veins that are swollen, large, and filled with melancholic superfluities which occur in many parts of the body: and most of them are found in the legs, especially in the thighs of those who move about a lot, work hard, or carry heavy loads.
Therefore, it should be that you administer the body with a strong dose of black choleric, sometimes through vigorous perspiration.
Then take blood from the patient in a sitting position.
The cure of those veins with iron is according to two methods. One is, so that they sit and black blood is drawn from them. And the other method is, so that the vein is ligated, and all of it is extracted.
The sectioning of this is according to this method: Wrap the leg first with hot water, until the thick, putrid blood is resolved. Then tighten the leg of the patient from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the knee with thread, using the rope. Then dry the vein at one place, or two, or three wide sections.
Then draw blood from the lower part of the leg to the upper, and from the upper should it be drawn by the phlebotomist first while the patient is still standing. Then cut off the nail down to the bottom: until it has run out of blood as much as you see is sufficient, and as much as strength endures.
Then bandage it up: and tell him to refrain from foods that cause black chill: and again drainage and bloodletting when the veins are filled, and this hurts the sick person.
But his elevation is according to this mode. Shave the wound, if there are many hairs in it. Then introduce himself into a bath: or wet himself in his own leg with warm water, until he turns red, and the veins swell: or exercise himself strongly, if there is no bath present, until he warms the limb.
Then dry the skin in the direct section of the vein along its length: or at the end of it by the knee, or in the lower part of it by the heel.
Then open the skin with a hook, and scrape the vein from all parts, until you can feel it: and it is at the appearance of it that you see it turn red from white by its decline. When then you remove it from the skin, you see it white as a string.
Then introduce under it Radium, until it comes out and exits the skin: suspend it with a blind hook, gentle.
Then dry another section next to that section by three fingers. Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears. Then apply Radium to it as you did, and suspend it with another hook as you did at first.
Then dry another section, or more sections, if you can endure it. Then apply Radium, and cut her last section at the heel.
Then take it out to the section that is above it.
And do this, until you take it out from the upper section: or longer sections, until you have taken it all out: then cut her.
But if he does not obey you in having it extracted and washed, then put a strong thread twice around it and tie it up and extract it: or insert under it radium: and withdraw your hand from all sides until it comes out. And be careful so that it does not injure itself. For if it injures itself, it will be difficult for you to wash it well, and it will get into the illness from it.
So when you have extracted it all: then put on the wound wool dipped in wine and oil with a scent or oil: and take care of the wound, until it heals.
That if the vine is contracted, it has a curvature where there is an innovation to its parts, and it is not like what we said according to the straightness: then you must find on it for all the parts of its curvature, and the places of its innovation.
Then hang it up with a hook until you have washed it all: and be careful by your section on it so that you do not injure yourself or hurt yourself, for it will be difficult over you to wash it well or to extract it. Preserve therefore your prudence.
The Shape of the wound when the vine heals.
The shape of the hook.
It is not a curvature like the rest of the vine, and there is no acute extremity, so as not to injure a hand: and it has gross flexibility, soft: for if it were subtle, it would hurt a hand with its subtlety: but it has superfluous grossness, as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is born in the legs in warm lands, such as that of the horse and of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands, scant of grass, that is to say, in those where no草 grows, nor trees.
And perhaps it is born in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And this generation is indeed from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as they occur within the bodies of snakes and worms of the ascaroidea, and worms that are generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this venereal disease is a severe inflammation of the thigh. Then the place becomes swollen and painful. Then the vein begins to come out of the place of its swelling, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When then it appears from this extremities, then you shall bind the same with a screw of lead, whose weight is a drachm of brass, to two drachms and mark it: and then take off the lead that is hung on the thigh.
Whenever then it goes out from this anything to the outside, bind the same in lead and mark the same. That if it is prolonged for a long time, then he will cut off a part of it, and bind the remainder. And you shall not cut it off its root before it goes out all. For if you shall cut it off, then it will contract, and enter into flesh: and it makes happen a blister, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad wound.
Therefore it shall be that it is suavly handled, and taken out gradually, until it goes out from its last end, and remains nothing of it in the body: and from this very vein go out in some men, who is in length of his five palms and ten fingers. And then he came to me, for he went out by a penis that was twenty palms long.
But if you shall be cut on you in the hour of your medication: then you shall introduce a rod into its opening, and pierce it through a long way with the body, until all that is in it is discharged out of the same matter: and you shall administer putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days. Then take care of him in the cure of the blister.
And this vein has branches in many places, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Take care therefore of itself, as we have said in the division, and with what precedes.
[On] Section on worms that are born under the skin, and it is called "Illness of the cattle.
This sickness is called in some country among us "Illness of the cattle": because it often happens to the cattle and is a pale flesh, which is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it leaves the whole body, going up and down: and is perceived by the sense in walking with its limb from one member to another, until it breaks off where it has broken off in the skin, and goes out.
And its generation is from the decay of some humors. As worms and snakes happen, that is, earthworms, and roundworms in the belly.
And are afraid of its evil. Because when it leaves the body and rises to the head and comes to a place: then perhaps it opens in it, and goes out, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
But when you are to treat it, and to remove it, then it is not done by the sense of touch or sight.
It must be, that you should tie what is above it, and what is under it with a strong cord. Then dry off on top of it, and remove it.
If it has sunk into the flesh, and not hurt itself: then put over the place a cauldron with fire, until it dies.
And greater than this, which is feared, is its decay, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
But if you see it having already come to the head near the eye, then tie under it a good tight cord. Then dry upon the flesh, and pull it out.
And it is fitting that the sick one should use his own purification of his body with medicines that dissolve the bad putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
[De] Section [i.e., cutting] on disease [the part] of Nakir.
This disease is called in our tongue Nakir, and it is a pain that occurs in some part; then it changes from one member to another.
And indeed I have already seen him, according as I tell you. I was called to a sick woman in some wounds. And she laid her arm on me; and I saw an inflammation of the lung in the broncia [i.e., windpipe].
And after I had left for an hour, I saw one inflammation running with fire as it ran down from her shoulder; and it went up to her arm more rapidly than she could run: so that it was like silver in motion when it runs from place to place.
So the pain then disappeared from that part, and remained fixed in her shoulder.
Then after I had left for an hour, it ran into the rest of the body until it reached another arm.
Then he told me that it was pulsing all over his body; for I saw it.
I was therefore astonished at the speed of its change from one member to another. And indeed I had not seen this disease with my eyes before it ran in this way. However, I saw many who found the disease to change from one member to another: and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think that this was because she is from those who are from dried-up wounds of the skin; therefore, it follows that this changeability of motion seems to be due to wind.
And it is necessary that those who are not affected by this should not appear in this way in those who are languid and have moist bodies; hidden wounds.
When then you shall take the cure of his eye, and he shall feel that pain: if it appear to thee in his eye, as we said, then thou shalt bind it above him, and under him likewise quickly: and dry it above him, till he go out that windiness: and causticate the place.
But if you do not see the eye with your eyes: then cure that eye with the removal of the body, and with it the windiness that it expels, and with carminative pills made from foul-smelling plants, and with pills made from serax and similar things.
[On the Extraction of Arrowheads].
Arrows differ according to their species, and according to the places in which they are lodged in the body.
Of these there is a variety, for some have large points, and some small; and some are conched, and some are flattened. And of these there is one which has three angles. And of these are tongues. And of these are arrows.
Those however which lodge in the limbs, fall according to two modes. For the limbs are conched from those principal members, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the urinary bladder, and those like them. When then it falls into one of these limbs, and you see the signs of death, which I will tell you about later, then you must extract the arrow from among them, for death follows it in many dispositions. But when those bad signs are not apparent to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then draw it out, and mend the wound.
For when the signs occur in the brain when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and comes out above the brain, there occur from it: for there is a violent jaundice, and stuttering, and giddiness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and cramp in the tongue, and convulsions, and confusion of thought, and forgetfulness. And perhaps blood will flow from the nostrils, or from the ears. And perhaps speech is cut off, and the ox is destroyed. And moisture that is like white pus may flow from the wound's site. And it shall issue therefrom a substance similar to meat soupy in consistency.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from cure, and draw out the arrow if it has not come out.
The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are these: that is near the left nipple: and it feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in a soft thing. And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to that of a pulse: and black blood flows from the neck. And follows this chill in the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting. So you see that death has come without a doubt.
The sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the flow of foamy blood from the neck; and the veins that follow the spine are pale, and their color changes. And he breathes out great, deep breaths; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
If the arrow falls into a rib cage which is in the breast: then it is near the back ribs: and it causes a great longing with a throbbing pain, with a sigh: and all the limbs of the arms move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it flows out from the neck with some uneaten food.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach and becomes stuck there: it flows out from the neck some stool, or dung, or a torn intestine which has already been ruptured. There is therefore no hope of curing it, nor of drawing out the arrow.
If the arrow falls into the bladder and flows out urine: and proceeds from it something to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the sick person: then you know that it is mortal.
The remains of the limb, such as the face, neck, throat, spatula, aid, dorsal spondylarthroses, furcula, hip, thigh, and shin bones, and similar bones from the limb are preserved according to various dispositions: when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve; and it is not a penetrating arrow.
And I will tell you that I saw such arrows exist, as you indicate by that one about your curing.
That is, because a certain man had an arrow hit his eye's tear duct, at the root of his nose. So I removed it from him on the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I drew out another arrow from the Jew, which had hit him in the fat of his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I could not get it out except for its far end, which held to its own wood; and it was a big arrow of Turkish arrows, with a soft iron point, where there are no flanges.
So the Jew was healed, and no harm came to his eye with that accident.
And I drew out another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and that one has ears. So I followed it with two guides between the two; and it was already submerged in his throat. So subtle was I with it, that I drew it out: and the Christian was healed.
And I drew out another arrow from the belly of a man who had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
After that had passed over him thirty days, and there was no change in his disposition from what I had seen before the arrow; so I followed the arrow up, and I managed it, and drew it out: and he was healed, and no harm came to him with that accident.
I saw a man who had an arrow shoot through his back, and there was a bone that had become firm over it. Afterwards, then, having elapsed seven years, the arrow was drawn out from the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman who had an arrow shoot through her belly, and there was a bone that had become firm over it, and the arrow remained within her: and there was no change in any of her natural dispositions, and she did not find any harm in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man, who had an arrow shoot through his face: and there was a bone that had become firm, and remained, not finding much pain therein: and there were many others like this.
And I took the arrow out of the king's sons from the middle of his nose, and it had already begun to decline towards the right side a little: and the whole arrow was hidden.
So I was called to treat him after the arrow was shot out until three days. I found the arrow's shaft very tight.
So I examined it carefully, and could not feel it: but he himself felt a prick and pain under his right ear. I hoped that was where the prick came from.
So I applied plaster to the spot with the adhesive and digestive power, confiding to him that it would dry up the place, and let me know the sign of the arrow, so that I might break over it: but nothing happened in that place indicating that the arrow had followed its course.
So I applied the plaster to him for several days: and nothing happened, and the bone had become firm while: he remained weak with respect to taking it out of space for a certain day, so that he felt an arrow shoot through his nose on a certain day. And he told me about that.
And he told me about that. So I put acute medicine on that bone for several days, until it healed open: and when I tried to move him, I felt the arrow's slight prick sticking to the wood.
Then I added, through the acute medicine, to the opening of the wound until we could see the end of the arrow; and passed about four months with it.
Then, after the swelling had increased, and it seemed possible to me to introduce my fingers into it and move them, and it did not comply with exit; then I did not cease to be delicate, and devise means for it with engineering devices, until one day I managed to do it with a kind of crooked hooks, according to which the shape of them came at the end of the chapter, so I extracted it. Then I restored the fracture.
And the doctors are saying that the cartilage of the nose has not been restored. So I restored it, and the fracture was consolidated, and the health returned to its complete health: nor did he suffer from anything at all.
And I will tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: that you put that rule and meaning on it which I did not say.
For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood by narration: nor does it understand that book, and the craftsman compares little to much: and when something is absent, he finds a new operation, and a new instrument for the descent of external things of this art when they occur.
I will say then, that arrows do not come out of the body in which they are fixed, except by two ways. Or by attraction from the place into which it entered. Or by the reverse of another part.
And that which comes out from where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is attracted, and comes out.
That if it does not comply with exit within the hour in which it falls: then you must leave it for a few days, until it putrifies the flesh which is around it: and its attraction will be relieved, and its exit.
And also if it is lodged in a bone, and does not comply with you to exit: then leave it for a few days: and again bring it out with attraction and movement every day, until it comes out.
If he does not obey you until after a few days, then it is necessary that you cut off the whole skull with a thin saw, until the sutures are increased. Then attract him and remove him.
But if the arrow is already hidden and concealed in the body, and hidden from sense: then seek it out with effort. If you feel it, then attract it with some instruments that are suitable for attracting it.
But if you cannot reach it because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the depth, and there is no bone or nerve or blood there: then find it out, until the vein increases, and it becomes possible to remove the arrow.
That if they are ears which hold it fast from all parts, with any device that you can: and use your cunning if it cannot be freed by the movement of the flesh in the breaking of the ears, and their twisting, until it is satisfied.
And you, when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whichever part it is, then use the twisting of your hands with tweezers to all parts, until you make it satisfied: and the last subtility, so that the arrow does not break, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it, and its extraction.
If you cannot bind it in a single hour, then release it after some days, until what is around it putsrefies. Then apply the poultice again: for indeed bandages do harm if there is a contrary flux of blood, then administer what we said in its own chapter: and guard your virtue from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or chord.
And administer ointment in every way that is possible to you of the Sarmentum: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that, when you draw the Arrow, you make it so that the infirm person is according to the figure, according to what was in the case of the Arrow in itself. For it is more a matter of judgment. But if this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
But the Arrow which comes from the opposite part, or which has already gone out a little towards the outside: or which makes the extreme end of the Arrow to protrude by sensation from the upper part of the skin near it, and see that it is emerging: so cut it off above, and let the section be according to the quantity which enters into it.
Then attract it: for indeed it is easy to come out.
But if it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the Arrow presses into the bone, and expands itself: then draw it out.
And if not: release it for some days: and then apply it again, until it comes out.
If the wood of the Arrow is in it, then push it with that.
But if it has fallen, and you are to administer a push: then introduce the tool that is sharp, so that its sharpness enters into the tail of the Arrow: and then push it with that.
But if the Arrow is closed, then push it with the instrument entering into it. And the arrow is healed by that.
For if the arrow is poisoned, then you should cut away all the meat in which there is poison, and if it is possible for you to get that. Then take care of him with that which suits him concerning that.
That if the arrow is falling in the breast, or in the belly, or in the vesicle, or in the loin: and it is close to you that you touch with your hand, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut, and carefully from the incision of the flesh, or of the nerve, and pull it out.
Then bend the arm, if you see it, and take care of that, until it is healed.
And this is the form Of Forcings, with which Arrows are pulled out.
Behold that they are similar to the tips of arrows, made like iron: when they grasp it over the Arrow, they do not let it go.
And they are of many kinds, great and small, and medium, according to the quantity of the size of the Arrow, and the smallness of the wound, and the constriction of it.
Form of the Impeller Here is a description of the form of the impeller: It has four pieces of metal, like blades, joined to each other; and the blade that is nearest to the arrow is broader at one end and narrows towards the other.
And the form of the Impeller is dull.
This is like the ends of a radii, that the entrance into the arrow may be facilitated, and driven in with it.
Concerning the Phlebotomy of Veins.
There are thirty veins for phlebotomy, of which the custom is established in the body.
Of which there are six in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which appear in two times: and two veins, which are in the two eyelids of the two eyes, called the Aspiring ones; and a vein that is prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is in the end of the nose. And two guide-strings, which are in the neck. And two strings, which are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two strings, which are in the lower lip. These are the strings called Al-Ja'far. And two strings that are under the tongue.
But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms, there are five strings in each arm.
One of them is the cephalic vein, and it comes from the lateral side of the skull; it is called the common vein of the head. And the fusca. And the median vein, which is composed of a basal branch and a cephalic branch; it is called the common vein of the body. And the basilic vein, and it is placed on the internal lateral side: it is also called the titillary vein. And it is called the common vein of the leg. And the tendon of the biceps, and it is placed on the back of the forearm; and this is the one that is phlebotomized, and it is the one that appears above the thumb by the apparent compression.
And the salvatory vein; and it is a vein between the round and little fingers, and it has two branches.
In the thigh and in the foot there are three strings. One of them is that which is below the thumb by the lateral side, from the wrist to the elbow. And the second is the saphenous vein; its position is at the heel from the internal lateral side. And the plantaris vein; its position is also at the heel, from the lateral side.
In the other leg, there are three similar strings.
Regarding the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
The phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears is a treatment for old hematomas, hemiplegias, syphilis, and bad ulcers of the head.
And the quality of the phlebotomy should be as follows: And so he shaves the head of the patient and rubs his scalp with a rough cloth in the space between two eyebrows. Then the sick man strings his neck with a thong until two eyebrows appear. And these are the places behind the ears, in two depressed places of the head. Ask then your finger, and where you feel the pulse of his ears under your finger, there mark with a caustice.
Then take a scalp-candle, and that one is called an "incision". Then introduce him under the eyebrow until he reaches the nose. Then wash your hand with the eyebrow and the skin towards the top, and cut the eyebrow with a cut of incision. And the length of the incision is the amount of two fingers spread out, or about that: and make come out of the blood as you wish.
Then tie it with powder, and let it go, until it heals.
And now preceded in the beginning of the book of incision of ears, and their cauterization.
But two arteries which are in the two temples of phlebotomy, is to an ancient hemorroid: and salt the nape, and press steadily: and run the course of the flowing acutes to the eyes.
And the quality of phlebotomy for you I will tell you. Then the sick man strings his neck much, until two eyebrows appear by a manifest appearance: and she shows you the pulse of his ears under your finger. For then the signs with a caustice.
Then wash the skin above the eyebrow with your index finger, and introduce a scalpel behind, and wash the eyebrow above. And cut it, as you did in the two eyebrows, and let the blood run according to the amount of your need.
Then حل حلقة الجروح، ووضع يدك فوقها لمدة ساعة واحدة. بعد ذلك ضع الغرز فوقها وأضف بعض الجبائر، وشد الحبل بقوة حوله: ثم أرخِه حتى يشفى.
وبعد أن يتذكر الرجل ما حدث له، وجرحه، وكيف قام باستخراجه في البداية من الكتاب.
إن إجراء فصاحة دم الجبهة بعد فصاحة الدم على الرأس هو في الحقيقة لعلاج أمراض الوجه القديمة، وللصداع النصفي، والارتباك، والأورام الدموية. كما يمكن أن يساعد في علاج القرح البشعة.
وإن نوع فصاحة الدم التي سألتك عنها هي: (يتضمن) حلقة ضيقة حول رقبة المريض حتى يظهر الدم. خذ الأداة التي تسمى (فاسوريا).
ضع نقطة بارزة في رأس الفاسوريا فوق الجرح، واطردها على الدم باستخدام مشط أو أداة أخرى بطريقة ما؛ ثم أطلق الدم ليتدفق حسب الكمية التي تريدينها. ثم حل ثقب الجرح، وشد الحلقة حتى يشفى.
وأحياناً عندما يفتح مع الفصاحة العريضة. ومع ذلك، لا ينبغي أن يكون فصاحة حادة جداً، مثل بقية الفصاحات، لذلك يجب أن تكون عريضة بعض الشيء. وإذا كان الفصاحة بعيدة عن الفتحة، فهذا أفضل، لأن الفتحة قريبة منه، وربما ينكسر الفصاحة عندما يكون رفيقاً.
لكن الوعد بخصوص فصاحة الجفينين في عينين هو لعلاج التهاب شديد في العينين، وربما يكون هناك بعض الدم، أو صداع في العين، وأمراض الوجه.
And what is the quality of phlebotomy, so that it may bind the neck of the sick with a bandage. Then phlebotomize them: and you are standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made according to a traverse at a little distance along the length, with a little phlebotomist, slightly on the side, for there is no flesh in the place. If the phlebotomist is sharp at the end, perhaps it will break.
Then let the blood run out as much as you need. And place over them a cloth, and tie them up for the night, and unbind them.
But the veins of the nose are useful for a acute fever, and a rushing pulse, and ailments of the face, such as a headache, and a ruddy color that comes into the face: especially when it is old.
And what is the quality of phlebotomy, so that it may bind the neck of the sick. Then take his nose in your left hand, and take a little phlebotomist, long; and fasten it in the middle of his nose, between what separates the nose. For the vein does not appear to sense there, and because the blood begins to flow at once.
And it should be, so that your hand with the phlebotomist is slightly less: and let the blood run out according to your need. Then bind it for the night. For it is quickly restored.
But two phlebotomies of the guide are useful for constriction of a sore throat, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholy ailments, and an impetigo and bad ulcers, and corrosive sores, that is, herpes zoster.
And what is the quality of phlebotomy, so that it may bind the sick under each on his neck with a bandage: and let the craftsman stand over his head, and let the sick person sit on a seat.
Then cut a vein about an inch in length with a wide blade. Then remove the amount of blood that is appropriate for the temperature, or according to what you see as necessary for that matter. Then do likewise with another vein.
Then loosen the ligaments and pinch two veins together tightly: so that the patient does not faint. And let it rest until morning. For the wound heals well.
This is Albucasis' discussion of vein extraction. But the extraction of veins, according to Albucasis' method, is dangerous: because it tends towards the drinking of alcohol, and corruption of the gingiva; and sores that are bad, as well as cracks of the lips, and sores that are bad also, even those that are in the nose, and around its circumference.
And the quality of vein extraction is that it keeps the sick person from sitting before you: and tighten his neck with a noose. Then turn the patient's lip and look at two veins: the one is on the right side of the lip, and the second is on the left: and the indication of both is by the color of amber. And this is true: because there are small veins around them, black. Then cut each one of them as it falls.
But if you have any hesitation about yourself, and you don't know which is which: then proceed to the incision of the larger veins, and make them more manifest.
And do likewise with the two veins that are on the upper lip: and there is much, indeed, of custom with him: and cut two veins that are in the lower lip.
This is Albucasis' discussion of vein extraction under the tongue after the phlebotomy of the head. But the two veins that are under the tongue have a dangerous phlebotomy: because the phlebotomy of the head is for the pre-focations that are in the throat, and the sickness of the mouth, and the sickness of the mouth.
And what is the quality of phlebotomy, so that the sick person sits between your hands before the sun: and anoint his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side, and on the other side: and the color of both decline to blackness.
So phlebotomy both: and guard, so that you do not put your hand on them when you are phlebotoming them. For under them are the arteries, and perhaps it happens that the flow of blood comes out from those arteries.
The veins, of which there are three that are phlebotomized in the bed, are in which the custom of phlebotomy runs in all men.
And phlebotomy is done from them according to two ways. Or piercing with the phlebotome on one side: or anointing to the subtility of the decline: or drying with the phlebotomizer and it is Alnesil. And this is its form.
And from them are species wide, and subtle according to the width of the veins and the form of the phlebotomizer with a blade, as you see it. And it is suitable for opening closed veins, full, coming from, appearing, thick, and those that contain gross, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomist is of lesser width, and more subtle in the extremities.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of subtile veins, which contain citriny blood.
But the Basilica, which is a single vein of the three veins that are phlebotomized, is the iuuamentum. Because it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and neck, from this it follows that it goes into the chest and belly: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist to phlebotomize her, so that he does not fear, and sit on the edge of [the] fear from her, since under her is the artery. If he should mistake and add a needle to the puncturing of the vein, he would cut the artery and cause a flow of blood. Therefore, he should not add a needle when puncturing with the phlebotome: let him stand apart with Anesiacum.
If the Basilica does not appear with a clear manifestation, then you should remove it and replace it with another one, or seek out one of its branches: or you can place the phlebotome at the site of the bursa of the elbow. For this is manifest, and dry it with Anesiacum phlebotome, as we have said.
But if you want to make a phlebotomy on the same arm, then you should do it before the elbow joint, so that you can find the place of pulsation. Then mark the spot with caustic powder, then wrap the arm, and dry up the vein with a needle, as we have said. And let it not fall by chance into the space of the artery's place.
And when you see that it is swollen at the place where you have marked with caustic powder, then this swelling is the swelling of the artery: so remove it.
If you see blood rise at the site of phlebotomy, like a boy's urine, and it is pale blood, then know that it comes from the artery's blood. So then put your hand on the spot for a long time, and then take away your hand. If then blood is separated (for it is often separated) let the arm be held still, and let go of that part: and guard against its movement: and let it rest on fear for it.
And do not move that part for a few days, until it is healed.
But if the blood does not separate and hurts you: and there is no medicine present for your moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you. For its extremities are bruised, and blood is separated.
And take hold of the fascicle of skin and find it out; and take hold of a half, and bind it tightly over the place of the wound that is descending with the ligament and down to another day.
Then if blood is cut off, it is good. And if not: then take care of himself with what remains of the reminder from the place of the flow of blood that has been cut off: and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small wound place, and the possibility of the ligament out of the arm.
But the venose of the pig is a phlebotomy that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower body: because it is composed of the branch of Basilica and the branch of Cephalica, as we have said.
And it fits the phlebotome so that he is afraid of his phlebotomy, because there is a nerve under it. But if he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, it happens in her stupor, and difficult is its cure, and perhaps does not cure thoroughly.
And this nerve appears many times to the sense. But if it is hidden in some people and is subtle, and does not show itself: then you must put your phlebotomy so that he finds the phlebotomist, and a section with Alnesil, and far from the nerves with your strength.
That if the pig is between two nerves, then find a pig in length.
Of the pig of the head. But the phlebotomy of the pig of the head is a phlebotomy because it draws blood from the head, and brings to the ailments of the eyes.
And it must be in this pig proper, if you want, so that you phlebotomy it piercing with the phlebotomist oileum, or with the phlebotomist Myrtle: for it is healthier of all the pigs, because there is no artery under it, nor a nerve.
Indeed, it is fitting that you should go to the phlebotomist's shop, for he will only tie a knot on your head, and you should inquire about a gentler place: and it does not hurt him if it is not discovered with a first punch, so that it may be renewed several times with phlebotomy.
Indeed, perhaps you should cauterize certain people when they are not phlebotomized in the first punch, but it does not hurt him that cauterization in some way.
On the Usefulness of Phlebotomy and the Observation of Cauterization in It. The Qualities and Complications of Phlebotomy and What You Should Consider in Their Correction.
First, therefore, of these things you need to know, that phlebotomy is administered not unless for the preservation of health, and perseverance in it, and caution against the advent of sicknesses.
And so phlebotomy is done in one of three positions which are in a bed, namely: the cephalica, and the fusca, and the basilica. And so phlebotomy is done at the beginning of spring on a fast, and in summer: and in autumn, and winter after feasting, when there are indications of fullness.
And so phlebotomy should be done on the first or third day after having passed three hours from a meal.
But phlebotomy that is administered in sicknesses has not a determined time: but when it provokes conveniently and necessity to it, in the night, or in the day, and at all times, and at all times.
And it is not necessary that boys should be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old. Nor should a pregnant woman be phlebotomized before the fourth month and after the seventh month. Nor should seniors who have already passed sixty years be phlebotomized.
But when anyone is to be phlebotomized however it may be: it is necessary that he should purge his bowels before phlebotomy with a soft laxative, if there is much waste matter retained in them: so that the blood shall not attract the skin of the limbs from the bowels by its putridity.
Do not let the patient bleed too much, that is, do not cause nausea; and do not let him sweat from drunkenness until he has removed it from himself. Do not let the sick person have a water-based fever.
And let phlebotomy be repeated after diarrhea, vomiting, flux of blood, increase in copulation, toil, exercise, vigils, fasting, and any other thing that dissolves virtue from the physical body or animal substance.
Then consider with care before doing this, if the blood is thick with food and drink and medicine: if it can be done to him.
Then let him bathe in lukewarm water, if he does not object to it for anything: or let him exercise himself in some kind of exercise, that his blood may be softened.
And put phlebotomy to him in his chest, about the third day as we have said: and be careful that his chest be empty of all animal evil that day: such as anger, fear, and worry: and all bodily evils, such as toil, punishment, overindulgence, and such like.
And let him make his own things present with him when he is in his own country, so that he may have the use of what is customary to humans from aromatic substances, and smells, and delights, and similar things by quantity of possibility.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a table, which shall be higher than the phlebotomy table: then shall he take his arm out, and rub it with his own hand twice, or three times. Then let him tie a ligature with the cord, and twist it round two turns.
And let the constriction be tight, because a constriction is not equal when it is too much or by excess of constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood: or in relaxation, then also it prevents the flow of blood.
Then after the constriction, let the phlebotomist rub his hands together back to front, until the blood rises and feels good to the touch.
Then the phlebotomist removes the blood with little oil, of his own making.
Then he places his index finger of his left hand on the venation at the place where he plans to make a phlebotomy, little by little: so that the blood does not flow away, and the vessel is not injured by the pricking. For from the venations there flows blood as does a string when phlebotomy is performed: and from them there comes blood of good flow: and when you place the phlebotome on it, it is pressed by the phlebotome, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is tight; therefore, so that the phlebotomist may be firm and alert in all these things,
then let him place the phlebotome. If then one vein opens from one drop of blood, then it is good. And if not, then repeat the same drops a few times under that place or above it with some haste: if not, then find another place.
That if it is not pricked, or if it grows weak, then let him leave it for a day or two: and do not tighten the ligature. Perhaps indeed does attract the cold apostema. And let no bath be made.
Then let him repeat the phlebotomy if he likes it.
That if the opening is small, or blood flows slowly: and let him time so that not a drop of blood goes out of the amount that you wish: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place according to the straightness, and add to the procedure a little bit.
And do this with some haste, before that place is pricked: for indeed that place is pricked in many people during the procedure if it is small.
If then you see the person already pricked, then do not repeat the phlebotomy on that place at all: for indeed it is no excuse with you to make a mistake. And place on the venation some of the soft oil: for it will ease the course of blood. And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than the rest of the oil.
And likewise administer the oil of the earth in all your phlebotomies, wherever you do phlebotomy with the prohibition of the course of blood; and make that which is called Tyrocum (Toryon) and sagzene (sagxe), when it is put from one of them on the place.
For the blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
That if it should happen in the place of phlebotomy a great aposteme, for many times it happens, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except at that time, or is a small opening of the vein, then immediately put over the place a sponge infused with water and salt, heated slightly: and tie it one hour: for it is resolved.
And it is necessary that you should do that which is called a tyrocum  (Toryon) after the exit of blood from the vein itself with its complement, or from another vein.
That if it remains in the place after a certain time of blackening, or of verdigris, it does not hurt that which is called a tyrocum   (Toryon); and if it is a vein, put over it some oil, or dissolved myrrh: or some juice of mint, that is, of calamus or similar to it.
And many times happen apostemes and eminences at phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Then put your hand over it, then if it is soft to touch under your pressure on it, then that eminence is bad. Care therefore, that you put over it some of that which we have said. For perhaps blood flows from that vein.
But make a patch with it where there is a stenosis, so that the place may be hardened. Then take care of the hand itself with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you should give to every man out of his own blood according to the quantity of his virtue. And that which appears from the bright color on top of the blood.
If the blood is black, then let him leave it until it turns red: and if he sees it is thick, then let him leave it until it thins out: and if he sees it is sharp, then let him wait until its sharpness goes away.
And he who is full, strong, and resistant to the extraction of blood, let him draw it once, so that the phlebotomy of the vein may be increased, and let the phlebotomist stand on his left side: and in regard to him who is weak, let him stand on the opposite side.
And let him draw the blood from the veins, and let there be a tight opening; and it is better that what is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein should be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is healthier and safer than the incising of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy and healthier than phlebotomy by way of width and length.
And he who is accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, let him eat a little bit of bread soaked in grape juice before phlebotomy with moderate heating: or secani-bin, if he is warm: and let there be extracted from his blood in three veins, or four.
And if he has a cold complexions, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in honey syrup, or in honey syrup seasoned with spices, or in syrup seasoned with an aromatic smell.
That if it should happen that a syncopation occurs during phlebotomy, and there is a cause of his blood's exit: then let him drink in a bowl water of flesh, and syrup of the subtle aromatic: and let him use the aromatic with the algaria, and let him spread his chest while doing so: and let him use the rest which we have said in the distribution in the chapter on syncopes from the extraction.
But he who wants to recover his arm, and to let his blood flow a second time: it is necessary for him who has had phlebotomy because of excessive extraction, and whose power is weak, that he should let his blood flow little by little according to the strength in continuous days.
Whoever wishes to set his broken arm in place, and to stop the flow of blood by means of second application, and the body is strong; then he should do so after seven hours, or nine from the time of the first phlebotomy.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which he leans: it is necessary that he should do this on the second day or the third.
In whose body there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and which causes fever: it is necessary that he should be taken out of it a certain quantity of blood, and that so much blood be drawn from him as will increase the opening until syncope occurs; after you have preserved all the conditions of phlebotomy; and in order that you may put your hand upon his pulse at the place where the blood flows, so that death by syncope does not occur. For many times it happens that the phlebotomist does not know and falls through carelessness.
And it is not when you wish to set the arm in place, and to stop the flow of blood by means of a second application, that the orifice of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, so that it presses upon him with vehemence, and turns quickly inward. For that is a bad wound, deeply let go, until he is phlebotomized for the second time.
Or move it with keenness of phlebotomy that which is coagulated from blood at the orifice of the vein, and put upon him a certain amount of dissolved salt in water. And place upon him some of the tar-water or the sagden, and place the body with gentle compression until blood comes out.
If, however, the vein is already blistered, then let go of it, and do not press it, until it returns to its normal state.
That if necessity compels to stop the flow of blood by means of a second application, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize him above that place, or in another arm into another vein.
But the vein of the arm is opened at the place of the fustuce and the basilica, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is made of them.
And the quality of its opening, that the sick person puts his hand in hot water, until it turns red, and the new one appears clearly.
Then it is bound over it with a little tightening of the ligament. Then the bloodletting is done according to the direction of the veins, not according to their length, and the opening is wide, and your bloodletting is done over the bandage of the hand a little bit.
If the blood flow is prevented, then take the hand again into hot water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have the need to stop it.
But if you were in the days of summer, then you are excused from the repetition of putting the hand into hot water. And indeed the course of blood in hot water is long during the cold season.
And the bloodletting of this vein is healthier for all veins, because it is not a pulsating vein, nor is there a nerve.
But bloodletting on the right hand of the patient confers health on the liver.
And the quality of its opening is that you squeeze the hand with a little ligament, or your hand, after you have put it into hot water, until the new one bends, and is clearly felt to be sore. Then the bloodletting is done by crossing it. And if you cut it completely, it will not hurt that thing at all.
And keep your hand away from bloodletting. For under it are the nerves of the fingers denuded of flesh.
Then take the hand again to hot water, and let the blood run in it. For if you do not repeat it in hot water, the blood will coagulate at the opening of the vein, and the flow will be prevented.
So when you have extracted a certain quantity of blood from necessity, then put oil and salt on it so that it does not harden faster.
And in the same way, you should do with all broken limbs.
The instrument for phlebotomy from the left hand is this: since it is related to splenitis: and likewise do with its phlebotomy, as you did with the second one equally.
The instrument for phlebotomy of the veins is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the uterus, and retention of menstruation, and ailments of the kidneys, and old sores of the hips and thighs, and similar ailments from illnesses.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that it should put the sick foot into hot water: and make friction on it until the blood flows, and tie above the knot with a thong. And the place of the blood is at the heel, visible towards the thumb: and many branches come out of it towards the foot's face.
Phlebotomy should therefore do with a larger branch of it, or at its heel in the cluster: since it is better and healthier.
That if you phlebotomize it in the foot's face, then be careful of the nerves that are under it on the foot's face.
And place your phlebotomy so as not to hit it: and let the phlebotomist be silent.
If blood flow is prohibited, then turn the foot of him into hot water: and let the blood run into it, until it flows.
That if there is a mistake in the phlebotomizer in the first cut, then let it remain with phlebotomy towards the top for a while, since the place is healthy, and do not fear harm from it, when you are tapping the nerves, as we have said.
And likewise with the other limb equally.
But the location of the sciatic vein, as we have said, is at the heel from the side of the pine tree.
And the treatment of varicose veins is to relieve pain due to hot blood.
And the quality of phlebotomy is that it should be done with warm water and dried off; and his leg should be bound up tightly from the hip to the heel for four hands, with a long thin strip: for indeed it does not appear except for this reason.
When it does appear, then do the phlebotomy as well as you can according to your ability or turn; and it is better either to cut it off with a scalpel or to separate it by section. For the place of it is salutary, and itself is hidden to many people greatly.
For the place of it is salutary, and itself is hidden to many people greatly. If indeed you do not feel it at all: then phlebotomize some of its branches, and that which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear: and cut away from the nerves, and cause it to run with a quantity of blood as much as you wish.
Then حلصه ہڈھ کے علاوۓ سے، اور اس میں ویسھ کھڑیں گے اور اس پر گھڑاں کرگے گے. جیدھ بھی آپ ہڈھ کو راحتی دے گے گے.
وہ بات ہے کہ: "بھلوتومی کی سِتھ بھلوتومیا کا استعمال کرنا اور ان کی کیفیت".
ان سے بات میری جاتے ہیں: "بھلوتومیا کا استعمال گھڑیں اور نازک جانے سے ہوتا ہے".
وہ بات ہے کہ یہ دو तरह سے کرا جاتا ہے: "بھلوتومی کی ایک وڈیوں سے ہڈھ میں پڑکنے اور دوچھ رہنا". یہ بات ہے کہ ہم دو بات کا بھلوتومی کی وڈیوں سے کرتے ہیں: "بھلوتومی میں نکالنا اور خون چھوکتا".
And this Ventosis which is without scarification, is according to two modes. Or indeed it is with fire. Or it is without fire.
And the Ventosis which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are fourteen places of the body. Of these there is one, Ventosis of the noble, and it is last of the head: and Alkehel, and it is middle of the neck: and the Ventosis of the Al-Hadhdahim, and they are two folds of the neck from both sides simultaneously: and the Ventosis of the mind, and it is under the jaw in the lower mouth: and the Ventosis of the two spatulas: and the Ventosis of the Achhos on the end of the tail: and the Ventosis of the two flames, and they are middle of the two arms: and the Ventosis of the two knees: and the Ventosis of the two cheeks.
And indeed Ventosis does not extract blood from you from small sparse veins in the flesh, and because of it the power does not fall from them, such as is the case with phlebotomy. And it is not necessary that Ventosis be administered with fire or without fire in any illness that occurs from fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
That if necessity compels to Ventosis from illness, or because of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and at its middle, and at any other time.
That is, because there is a person who, when blood multiplies within him, until it needs to be extracted by Ventosis, finds in his head a headache and dizziness.
And among them is one who finds fullness and redness of face in his head, neck, and throat. And among them is one who finds itching in his face, forehead, darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
And among them is one who scrapes the place of his Ventosis. And among them is one whose laugh multiplies. And from these he has derived the taste of blood in his mouth: or let him lick his tongue, and let him spit out the blood. And from these his sleep increases. And from these his vision is increased while he sleeps; and he sees blood and redness, and those who are slain, and plaags, and things like them.
When then shall we see anything from these, and especially if it be in the third month: let us then put on the wind, after they have passed over two or three hours of the day.
But the sign of Wind-panting is this: for it adds to the heaviness in the head, and that which is breathed forth goes into the eyes. But it is necessary that that be after the evacuation of all the body.
And this Wind is called Phleborrhagia cephalica.
And it should not be used by one who has a cold complexione, or in whom there is a catarrh. For it infers great harm.
And for this reason it should not be used by the elderly, and in whom there are diseases of the head due to cold.
But whoever uses this will fall into oblivion.
And for this reason you should order the Wind-panter to put his hand down slightly towards the bottom, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Wind-panter or Alchehol is called Phlebotomy of the Face, and phleboomy of the nose, and for this reason it adds smegma, constricts the windpipe, and makes fissures in the instrument of wind, and coughs, and fills up.
And it should be driven out by Wind-panter slightly, for if it is put down lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Wind-panter is called Alchadhihim, it brings about pain to the accidents in the head, and to the eyes, and to the headaches, and to the perforations, and to the pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the phlebotomy of the nose.
It is fitting that you should refrain from cutting with the scissor [i.e., with a scalpel] before the wound has closed: so that it does not strike an artery and cause a flow of blood.
But if there is a wound in the mouth, let him put alcohol in it and wash away the inflammation of the gums and similar ailments that are in the mouth; and let him stay where there is phlegm [i.e., a fluid] in the two lips.
But if there is a wound with pus, let him go to the alchemist [i.e., an physician or surgeon], who makes it [the wound] well and cold.
But if the wound is inside the body, let him use three scissors  [i.e., scalpels] of different sizes: the Basilica, the Fusca, and the Cephalica; for these draw blood from all the small veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins draw blood from the larger veins until the drawing reaches the three main veins.
And it is fitting that you should warn Ventosator not to cut too much: for the place is naked of flesh, and there are nerves and arteries underneath.
But if a wound is ventsated on top of the anus, let it be applied to hemorrhoids and ulcers below.
And it is fitting that you should warn Ventosator not to make the wound too small, and not to use iron  [as a cutting implement]: for the place does not like strong suction, and perhaps the fine scalpels will break  [if applied too strongly]: and cut with a big cut.
But the fine scalpels diminish little by little    [the wound]: for they draw blood from all the body, and cause old pains in the kidneys, and membranes, and vesicles: they provoke menses, and bring forth both urines, and wind; and stay where there is phlegm of the two saphenous veins and the alhorcobene.
However, it weakens the body greatly, and causes fainting in many people.
The joint of the hock is close to the joint of the two hind legs.
The quality of the position of the hock is that you should place the foot in the first place without a grip, and wet with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the foot, but put it quickly and move it quickly so that the fluids come to the spot from all sides: and do not stop doing this and continue, until you see the spot already red and swollen, and it appears red with blood: then therefore cut, and repeat the suction slowly. Then consider in the arrangement of the bodies.
For one who is of tender flesh and rare pores, it should be that you cut once only, not more: so that the spot does not ulcerate.
And order the hocker to amplify the incision and make it deep: and moderate the suction in ease, and quickly, and with a swaying motion.
That if there is gloom in the blood, then you should cut the spot twice. In a single blow the first incision opens the way for subtlety of blood, and makes it runny: and in the second blow of the perscrution of the subtle extraction of gross blood.
If the blood is very foul, then let the incision be made in a single blow: so that the last result is obtained.
And to the end, when we want to extract blood slowly, slightly, or at all, one incision is enough for us. That if we want multiple extractions of blood, let us make multiple incisions.
And if we are measuring, that blood is thick: then it should be that the incision is deep: and the equal end of the incision is the depth of the skin.
What is this that should be administered from oils in the arrangement of the hocks, and what does it caution the hocker?
In that which the skin is thick, tough, dark, and whose pores are tight, it should be that the places of the hocks are anointed with open, gentle, and soft oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as is aleurites oil, or violet oil, or almond oil, or sesame seed oil.
If it is in the season of winter, then then oil of Narcissus, or oil of Lily, or oil of Camomile, or Sarbatic oil: and to these similar ones.
But if there is a gross superfluity, then cold oil: then amaranthine oil, or oil of Balsam, or white oil, or oil of Anise: and to these similar ones.
But if it is a wind-ridden case of widespread diarrhea with tender meat, then one should be prevented from the oil, and these places should be cleaned with water rosated, or cold water, or water of sole, or water of cucurbits, or water of portulaca: and similar to them.
But the one whose blood is of many humors should clean the wind-ridden cases with vinegar, or water of Myrtle, and Sumach: and similar to them.
But if there is a gross superfluity, he should clean his wind-ridden cases with old wine, or with water of Samsou, or with a decoction of Anet, or of Camomile: and similar to them.
And it should be prevented that the diarrhea occurs in a bath, or in a washing-place; but it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours.
And it is not appropriate for anyone to sleep after the diarrhea.
What is needed so that the wind-ridden one is cured, or the phlebotomized one before the diarrhea?
And after that, you should consider in the first place: then if it is a wind-ridden one, or a phlebotomized one, whether there is an acuteness and inflammation in his blood: then he should take something to cool him down, such as granatum muscat; also with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and juleb: and similar things.
And put away from him his spicy foods, and any meat that causes asecation, and cooked foods with berries: and similar things.
If his complexions are cold, he should take syrup made from honey, or from almond milk, or alsecania, made from seed; and wine with a strong odor, which is between new and old; and it should be prescribed that he eat a little food. And put on his food feathers, and birds, that is, many pigeons; and let him eat pigeon-feathers.
And it should be that the drink of bloodletting and phlebotomy is more than food; and it should be given in a drink to some men at the hour of the tarragon, or a remedy with musk, that is, muscatel, or alsecaine before bloodletting: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members are comforted, and the blood is made subtile. And it should not be that they take it in a hot drink.
On Bloodletting Without Scarring. But those bloodletting that are without scarring are those that are laid on the liver, and the spleen, and the bladder, and the navel, and places of the testicles, and the stomach-ach: because these members do not suffer scarring on themselves.
And it is not sought through them, except by an attack of blood from one member to another: such as we put the Bloodletting on the breasts in the sickness of the flow of blood to the nose. And we use them, that we may relieve a member from cold bloodletting that is in a member: such as we put the Bloodletting on the stomach, and the navel. For herself tightens the member, and heats it, and takes away pain because she has resolved the bloodletting.
Also is laid on the kidneys when there occurs in them urine or stone. For by virtue of its own attraction it may perhaps open the urine, or rid the place of a stone: for it can open the urine, or remove the stone from its place.
And also when it is laid on the liver, and the spleen next to cold bloodletting that it takes in them: for itself does not take bloodletting from them.
And these wounds are dealt with gently with only a cut. And sometimes they are treated with fire.
And sometimes they are treated with warm water in pleural diseases: and that is, so that the Ventosa is filled, and it is large, with only warm water, or with water in which herbs have been boiled that are suitable.
The form of the treatment of Ventosa with fire.
Let the width of its opening be that of two fingers wide, according to which we form it: and the quantity of it in depth be half an inch: and let it be in the side of it at the place which is round about its middle, a small hole, according to the quantity that is put into it: let it be made of brass, or copper, gross margin, soft, equal, and third: so as not to wound the member at its position over it: and let there be in the midst of it a rod running through it of brass, or iron, whereon a candle is placed with fire.
And this kind of treatment is great, greater than we described before, and there is a little less one for diseases and ages.
For the wound of boys, and those who are weak, and different from that of men, and of big bodies.
But the quality of placing this kind of treatment with fire on a member, is, that you light a candle from linen at a distance, or a small candle made of wax: and put it over the middle of the rod which runs through it, so that the heat surrounds the lower part of the wound slightly, so as not to burn the body.
Then put it on the member: and let a finger be placed over the hole which I have said, until we hold the wound: while we hold it, take away the finger, and the steam will come out of that hole, and immediately the wound will be released.
Then the fire from the candle, according to its way, and repeat this treatment if you can bear it.
In Ventosa, however, which is administered in pleural disease with water, there is no wire across, nor a hole; and it is not administered except that water is filled and put on the limb alone.
And this is its form.
And this Ventosa is all the more large, so that it may hold much water, it is better.
[ ¶ On the suspension of blood-sugar.]
Sanguisugae are not administered in many, except in those limbs where it is not possible to place a wound-drape because of their smallness, such as the lip, and the gums, and things like them. Or on a naked limb, bare of flesh, such as a finger, and a nose, and things like them.
And the quality for using them is: that you take those which are in sweet waters, clean from corruption.
Then they are left to rest during the day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and there remains nothing in their stomachs. Then the body is evacuated of blood in the first place with phlebotomy, and with wound-drape. Then the nurse washes the limb, until it turns red. Then they are placed on top of it.
When they are filled, and fall, and it is possible to place the wound-drape on the spot, then it is better, and if not, then wash the spot with vinegar. Then with much water, and a rub, and is pressed out.
If the course of blood is prolonged after the application of blood-sugar, and it is a residue: then put a linen cloth in cold water, and place the body upside down, until the residue is separated.
If the blood multiplies, then powder of astringent is scattered on top of the body, crushed, or feathers, and things like them: until the blood is separated.
Or let half of herbs with an irritating principle be placed on the spot: and are left, until the herbs stick to the spot, because the blood is separated.
It is necessary to go again if necessary when it is possible to change them.
But if the blood-suckers are forbidden from suspension, then the place should be cleaned with recent blood. Or fasten them now in places until someone leaves some blood. Then they are placed, because when they sense some blood, they adhere immediately.
When you want to drop them, sprinkle over them some ground aloe, or salt, or dust; and they fall immediately.
This chapter is also often needed in the art of medicine, and it deals with the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Know ye, O sons, because they speak stolidly of this chapter to the doctors and to the laypeople, and have not examined the ancient book, and have not read its letter;
And for this reason it is made, that this mode from the sciences in our land is reserved. And I was not bored in it at all, and I have not been satisfied from it unless because of the length of reading of the ancient books, and study on their understanding, until I drew the science of it from them.
Then by experimentation and study of a long life.
And I have already described to you from it all that contains my science: and on what has passed beyond experimentation of mine, after I have shortened it for you, and have released it from the occupation of elongation, and have shortened it at the end of abbreviation, and have shown it at the end of declination: and I have formed in it many forms from forms of instruments that are administered in it, with the addition of declination, as I did in two preceding chapters.
Head II.
In the prolog of this chapter, we shall discuss the summary of the topic and the chapters that deal with the concept of station of bones: so that you, and those who are eager to know or learn this noble craft from you, may know it, or learn it from others.
I say, then, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall has occurred to someone: then you should prepare first to bleed him, and to solve the problem, or both at the same time: unless there is something that prohibits it, such as the weakness of virility: or he is one in whom this thing has happened, a boy, or an old man: or it is a time of great fever, or of cold greatly.
Then let him be satisfied with his food, cold dishes, and chicken, and meat that is tough, and avoid filling the veins with wine, or fatty meats, or whatever fills the belly with blood. Until you are secure from the heat of fever, and do not hasten to pour matter into the member: then let the sick one return to his normal routine with which he is accustomed.
When the jaw is beginning to be mended, then it is necessary that the sick person eat food that is nutrient, thick, dark, and full of liquid: such as food made from wheat mixed with water, and rice, and heads (of meat), and feet, and livers of fowl, and recent fish: and strong wine, and similar things. Since this regimen brings about a quicker and better healing of the fracture.
And you must know that bones that are fractured, when they are in the years of old age, and decrepitude, cannot continue and consolidate themselves according to their nature forever, because of the drying out of the member: and they consolidate and continue those that are at the end of leniitude, such as young men's bones.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.
And you should know that the types of fractures are diverse, depending on the different parts of the body; for example, a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the spine. And likewise, each member has its own distinctive features in terms of injury; and I will come to that with an explanation of each type of fracture, distinguishing it from other types, in its own chapter. And the species of fractures of bones also differ from one another:
Since a fracture occurs when a bone is bent out of shape, apart from the fact that it happens in an arch. And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone; and there are fractures that occur at an angle, that is, in an arch, and additions that come about, such as those that form in the reed when it is cut with a knife for writing. And there are also fractures that do not originate; and there is a fracture with a chip and a crack at the tip; and there is a small fracture.
And each type has its own tool or special device for restoring it, as the memory of each type is distinct in its own place.
And from this it can be recognized what type of bone fracture it is; that is, its curvature and eminence; and its feel to the touch, and the sound it makes when you squeeze it with your hand.
So when there is no curvature visible, nor a sound of creaking when you touch it with your hand, and there is not a great deal of pain; then it is not a fracture, but it may well be that there is a curvature or a small crack; so you need not move it about with your hand at all, except that you should place something from the doctors on top of it, whose memory has come to you, after a while in which it has settled into its place: then bind it tightly with a narrow band.
And you should know that the part which is when it arches and is divided into two, except for what happens to him of satagues, really all parts are moved from their comparison: then it is necessary for you so that you begin from your hour to rectify it, equalizing it before it happens to him a posthemia warm.
But if it happens to him a posthemia warm, then leave him for a few days until he is calm apoestema. Then make equal the part according to any way you can from laziness and art.
And you should know that the restoration of it and its equating is easier than the bones, in which satagues happen.
Then tighten the part, according to what comes to you the memory of it.
But if the satagues are in the bone, then necessary is the extension of this broken member from two parts, if hand sits, or foot: or with your hand, if the member is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
And your position which you put the member on a place equal, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try, so that you make those additions with all art, and according to any way you can in their places: and carefully according to your strength, so that does not happen on the weak through your operation, nor relaxation: and carefully according to your strength, that you apply one two bones with his partner, according to better shapes.
And it is necessary in that hour, so that you try and touch the member with your hand. But if you see there something different, rectify the part, and equating it by your quantity of strength.
And carefully the extension rapid, and strong compression, as do many stiff. For often happen through their operation the posthemia warm, or contraction in a member: as we have already seen that from their operations.
Then after resting, and when the operation is done and the member is fixed, quiet and peaceful: and remind the sick person of himself. And let the person be cautious, so that he does not fidget in his hours of illness, and his sleep is not disturbed during his resolution, and his agitation, and his digestion, and all his movements in the last strength of him. And so that he is cautious, let not be a position of the member with which pain follows. That is, because when he feels pain in the disposition of the member's position, or injury: then it should be, that you turn him over to another disposition from which he does not feel pain.
And be cautious with him, so that his position is equal and straight: so that no tortuosity occurs in the member when he is restored.
And the quality of a broken member's tightness is according to the width.
You know that broken members differ in their width, and their size, and their form.
Which of them are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the fin, and the like to them, then it should be, that the cloth be soft and thin. Which, however, are thick, such as the hip, and the shin, it should be that cloth is thick and hard.
Since the broad ligament connects a large member, and tightens it with equal tightness so that it does not enter it stain.
Then after your evacuation begin to put on a lotion suitable for him, in a soft wrap over the break site. Then begin to wrap three or four times the ligament over the break site, according to the length of the member: and tighten your hand slightly with the ligament.
Then walk with him on the upper side from the break location, and tighten less than your tightness, which you tightened the broken spot. Then lengthen yourself with the wrapping slightly from the break location, and soften your tightness gradually, until you take hold of a large healthy joint.
Then take a new one and roll it again over the broken place with carresses. Then move it with the carresses to the lower side from the fracture. And your operation shall be in the tightening of the carresses and softening of it, according as we said in the first carress.
Then put between the carresses a soft cloth or a pad as it is suitable for the curvature of the fracture, if there is any curvature: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Then roll again on the new one. Then set an equal distance between these carresses that are made askew at once, if there is no swelling or heat in the place.
If there is any swelling or heat in it: then put over it that which sits down the swelling, and let it take away the swelling: and let it go for a few days. Then tighten again on the place at once when
And let the carresses be of the width of a lathe's blade, smooth, and shaped wisely: or of wood from which are made gratings, which are made of pine, or of branches of palm, or of calinger: and let the amplitude of each carress be according to this form, and this figure.
However, let the carress that is put over the traction be a little thicker and wider than the other carresses: and the length of the carress let be according to the size and proportion of the member.
Then tighten again on the carresses with a new one according to the first tension. Then bind from above with the fils that are made askew according to what we said about the tension: and it is, so that your tension shall be over the broken place more: and as much as the length from the fracture increases, the tension shall decrease.
And let the fils be of middle thickness and softness, and of soft cloth.
For if the fils are thick, as the fils that are put from the dull surgery of the blind by means of twisted cords of linen, it is a great mistake: for the tension falls with them out of the right place.
And thin sutures again do not agree: for you do not achieve that which you wish by means of a rigid one with them.
And it is not necessary, so that it be between an anchor and an anchor less than the length of a finger.
That if a sick person is injured through the ends of the sutures after a rigid one in healthy places: then place under them from soft cloth, or red wool, until there is no pain from it.
When however there is a fracture with an ulnar bone, and there has been a break on the skin, I will return to it in the second chapter with regard to its uniqueness.
And you should know that not every broken member needs to be sutured from the first day. That is, because the member is large when it is, one should not put it on top of the sutures, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the development of seroma.
And this is the method of the ancient way of applying plaster, which are placed on top of a fracture and a dislocation.
The common abbreviated way of plastering, restoring a fracture with various compositions, especially for women and children, because it does not hurt from heat, nor from cold.
And it is so that you take from a flour miller, and there is wheat flour hanging on the walls of a rolling mill: and you make it like this, except for the cobwebs with alum: and you place its coating not thick, nor thin. Then use it.
The other way of plastering, restoring a fracture, and a dislocation, and a twist. Take alum, and myrrh, and acacia, and cow dung, and oil: and honey of both sexes, from 5 to 10 inches of myrrh, and alethos (an aromatic plant) in equal parts, if the composition is for a healing wound: or with alum, if the plaster is to be warm. Then put this plaster thereon. For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and suits many people.
A different way of making the plaster, which also suits fractures and twists. Take the wool of a sheep, and the flour of wheat, and of myrrh X drachms, and of aloes both kinds V drachms, and of acacia VI drachms, and of balm XX drachms finely ground; all of these are heavily bruised and rubbed together, and made into a paste with water or almond milk: and they are given.
A method of making the plaster for joints, and bones separated from their sites: which will ease their pain, and the break in the bone's connection, and the fracture. The sheep' wool is soaked in vinegar, and in oil boiled up; and it is placed on the place.
And in this very plaster there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good for calming hot swellings; and it drives away its own pains.
A method of making the plaster, which restores a broken bone. Take leaves from an oak tree and leaves from a fig tree; both finely ground, and all are thoroughly rubbed together, and made into a plaster with the two.
A method of making a short plaster, to be used in restoring a broken bone; and when you wish to relieve a hot swelling remaining. Take the root of the marsh-mallow, and of camomile, and of the flowers of the plantain, and of herb-seed; all of these are finely ground as one part; all are thoroughly rubbed together, and made into a paste with wine, if it is a limb that has been warmed.
If, however, it is warm, then make the plaster with wine and coriander seed; or with water, and use it.
A stronger method of making the plaster, which is more effective in the resolution of a hard swelling that occurs during the restoration of a limb. Take the root of the marsh-mallow, and of flax seed, and of poplar bark, and of mealy-fruit, and of sage, and of the flowers of the plantain, and of camomile; all of these are finely ground as one part; all are thoroughly rubbed together, and made into a paste with water from willow-buds, or with sweet water, or with wine. All this depends on the warmth of the member, and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates, in his book, did not say that a broken member should be placed in restoration of its function unless it is made of brass and oil: nothing else: and he relates that it should be of a middle degree between solidity and lightness.
But Galen, on the other hand, has said that for the restoration of a broken member it is necessary to apply substances in which there is a drying up of heat, such as myrrh and aloe and olive oil and similar things which we have related.
The mode of the poultice which is useful for wounds and pain. Take the yolks of eggs, and the teeth of horses or birds, and the feathers of birds, and the ears of corn, and salt in equal parts: they are to be pounded and sifted and made into a poultice.
But as to the quantity, which you are to use, that it may remain on the member, and then be dissolved, consider this, if you do not find that the pain, or itching, or the broken bone is moved from its place: then do not dissolve it over many days. If, however, there is a stinging itching in the place, or an unsettling pain, or swelling: then apply and dissolve it at once, and take off the poultice: and take a cloth, or sponge, wet with water: and dip it into the water, and wash away the place, until the itching is calmed, and the pain subsides.
If, however, there is a stinging itching in the place, or an unsettling pain, or swelling: then apply and dissolve it at once, and take off the poultice: and take a cloth, or sponge, wet with water: and dip it into the water, and wash away the place, until the itching is calmed, and the pain subsides. Then let the member rest for an hour. Then put over it a cloth dampened with vinegar and oil, or with oil only: and bind it on for the night, so that you are not troubled by heat, and the swelling of the member is calmed, and the pain of the member subsides.
Then frequently apply a small poultice: and do not strangle it with your own throat, or with anything tight, until it is healed.
That if you see, what the aposteme, and rubedo, and pain, and swelling, and all the accidents are now entirely removed, and you have plastered and tightened, then repeat that as you did at first equally.
That if anything does not happen to the member among those which we have said, then do not separate it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven. And when the member is dismissed after forty days all that, according to what appears to you from the solution of the member, as we have said, until such time as the fracture seems to have adhered, and the coagulation of the flesh above it has approximated: add also then to the striciture more than your first stricitur: and add also to the engorgement of food according to what preceded its remembrance.
But if you see the place of the fracture already drying up, and waning more than is necessary: then know that food is forbidden to reach it. So wet the member with warm water wherever you solve it, and let it be for all three days, and add a little relaxation to the stricitur.
By this operation then runs to the member food, and heals quickly.
But that which the dull restaurators do from the fracture of a member, when they do not restore it first, according to what is necessary, and restore it according to its tortuosity, is an error from their operation, and a great fear: and if it had been right, the ancient ones would have said it in their books, and performed it with it.
And I did not see any trace of them at all on that, and it is better that that should not be done.
Regarding the making of an accident in the head.
There are diverse kinds of fractures, and many forms of them: and their causes are distinct.
For from a fracture is made what is by impact with an instrument: and the impact carries the whole bone away until it reaches the syphac, which is under the bone, as does the axe in the wood: and therefore this kind of fracture is called the axial fracture.
The blade of the knife hit some bone, and it hit his face, and did not cut all the way to the last of it: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, absolute Levation.
And a fracture is between two fractures, or large, or small.
And from a fracture comes contusion, or friction: and its cause is hitting with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
And this fracture is also piercing, which is beginning to approach a flap, which is under the bone: or is in the face of the bone: and this kind of fracture is also between two fractures, or small, or large.
And from a fracture is one that is hidden in the bone in a slender hair: and it is a small crack, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called the species of fracture Capillus.
And from them is a fracture that is made by fall or hitting of a stone, and similar things, which makes the layer of bone go inside, and it is made up of concavity: such as happens with the caldarii of air when there is a fall on them, and part of them goes inside.
And much more does this happen in the heads of the humeral bones, as are the heads of boys.
And all these kinds of fracture have separate healing, and I shall mention it again when I speak about them all together in their places.
And we know all these kinds of fractures by inspection on them, and by inquiring about them with the help of tests, and by removing the corrupted flesh that is above them.
The species Capillus is recognized by this, that it is discovered on the bone, and is scrubbed, and is held over itself with caustic: for the fracture appears black.
In the cure of a fracture, take into consideration at first the nursing injuries: then if you see that there are symptoms of recovery, as loss of appetite due to worry, or cholera, or spread, or loss of mind, or loss of speech, or fainting, or high fever, or blinking of eyes, and redness of them, and similar things from among these many signs of concern, it is certainly impossible for it to heal: and if you see that there are non-worrying symptoms, and you hope for recovery: then begin its cure.
What is, if it comes to you wounded first when wounded: and it is that in the days of the half, then it should be, that you study in the ablation of bone before the fourteenth day second all disposition.
And if it is in the days of summer, then it should be, that you remove the bone before the seventh day, before the corruption that is under the bone from the pannicle, and those accidents which we have described.
That if the fracture of the bone has already reached to the pannicle touching the brain, and is with small, and attraction: then it should be, that you fall on the broken side, and ground, according to what I tell you.
And it is, that you shave the head of the wounded: and you discover over the bone in any way possible to you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is more relaxed over the weak.
That if it happens to you during the detection of the bone of a flow of blood, or hot poultice: then you oppose to him with what is necessary. And it is, that you fill the place with rags soaked in wine, and roasted oil: and you make the wound quiet, until the poultice stops, and you are safe from a flow of blood. Then begin in the cure of the bone, and in its ablation.
And that is done according to two ways.
One way indeed is, that you fall on the bone with a sharp and narrow chisel: and this is the form of it.
Then another way is, that you administer a wider chisel after a narrow one: and this is the form of it.
Then also adminster another wider chisel than the second: and this is the form of it.
Then the second way is, that there be with you a number of chisels different: some are wider to some, and some shorter to some: and they are in the last end of their sharpness, and are made of iron, or fuel: and you use convenience in striking on the chisel, so that it does not hurt the head, and harms itself.
If the jaw is strong and firm: then you should perform the incisions around it before administering the incisions with the scalpel on the bones called ribs, which are not deep: and they are not so named unless they do not pass beyond the end of the bone to that which is after it; therefore, because the rib is a round extremity above that which is sharp under its head, similar to its margin, and a small circle prevents it from diving into, and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is fitting that you should take from these ribs a great number, each of which corresponds to the thickness of the bone, until you have all the cranium with Terribles: the extremity of whose sharpness in length and brevity corresponds to the quantity of its thickness, as was said above.
And this is the shape of the three kinds of Terribles, or trepanations.
The quality of the piercing around the broken bone is: that you put the rib on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then change the rib to another place and put what is between all the holes of the thickness of the radius or around it.
Then cut with the scalpel what is between all the holes from the bone and make it thinner than you can from the end of lightness, as we said, until you have eroded the bone, or by hand, or with any other instrument that you have prepared for it: such as knives, and fine awls.
And it is necessary, so that you take all the precautions, that the rib or the scalpel does not touch anything sharp.
When you have thus pierced around the bone and separated it from the shell, if it is continuous with it, and extract it, then you should shave it, and make the same extremity of it that remains in the bone with another similar scalpel. However, it is necessary that it be thin and subtle rather than other scalpel.
If there remains anything of the small bones and the joint: then take it with ease, along with that which is with you of the instruments. Then care for the wound after that with liniments, and the ointment which we have mentioned.
And another way of operation is easy, far from fear: which said Galen, and praised it greatly: and this is his speech. Necessarily it is to you first, that you begin to grasp the part of bone in which the fracture is more painful, and more manifest: until when you have grasped that part, and put under it the extreme end of this lenticular incision, whose this form.
And the lenticular part, does not cut anything: and the acute part of it in its two sides running in length, as you see: that it may be the lenticular part laid on the siphum, face of it incident acute in the bone.
Then strike over the Incisorium from one side with a small mallet, until you hit all of the bone with ease, as it moves around: and you are safe from the panicule, which does not happen in that accident, which you fear most truly.
And if the medicans is not stupider of men, and more ignorant of his own, and is not sleeping, then if there remained anything attached to the bone from the pannicle in some places, he would strike it away from him with the extreme end of this lenticular incision, and set it free from him with ease. For it is set free from him without injury, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the pannicle, and that which is cut off from the bone is the shape of it, and there remain in it roughness and subtile satagiae: then it is necessary, that you rub off that roughness, and pluck out those satagiae with fine rasors, which you have prepared of various quantities, so that it may be possible for you to administer them in every place more convenient for them, and more right of their shape, according to the operation to which it leads you, and the broken bone, and its form. It is necessary that you should make your incisions in your teeth, at first roots, widely apart from each other. Then use a thinner knife after the incision.
It is necessary that you should make your incisions in your teeth, at first roots, widely apart from each other. Then use a thinner knife after the incision. And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you have come to administer a thin one, and thinner of all of them.
In each of the other cracks between the teeth, and in the small fracture, it is necessary that you should administer care, according to that which leads to the straightening of it.
And this is a thing which is not hidden over all, to which in this art there is whatever study, and it stood on that which we have written, and shown in the large fractures.
But if a flap of skin is held back, when you cut the teeth: then it is necessary that you should take a piece of linen cloth, according to the quantity of wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. Then take another piece of cloth, doubled or tripled, immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do that which you can more easily over it, so that it does not stick to the sponge.
Then administer over it a wide bandage: and do not tighten it, unless according to the quantity which holds the wound only: and let go of it with this cure for one day, or two days, until you are free from fever. Then dissolve it, and administer after it the medicines with which there is no need for dryness: such as the roots of lily, and flour of herb, and powder of thorn, and of aristocha, and similar to them: and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is powdered over the wound like these are dry.
And administer universally in it any medicine of its property which is to cleanse, and not to sting. And take care according to your virtue, that the wound in your cure is clear: and that it is not in it any oil of ointment, or any dirtiness.
And take care according to your virtue, that the wound in your cure is clear: and that it is not in it any oil of ointment, or any dirtiness. And do not let the virus aggregate therein at all; for when the virus aggregates over the brain's skin, it corrupts and腐敗 it, and a great evil befalls those who are weak after that: and already it has happened in the head's sinkhole, when he was opened from him a hole, especially when his care was neglected, and blackness appeared on its surface.
Consider therefore then, if those accidents happen to the sick which we have said, you will know that it is certainly fatal.
And if blackness does not happen, unless it is because of the medicine which is put on it, and it is in the strength of its medicine, so that it makes it black: then you must take from honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and with them a cloth; Then put the head on the sinkhole: then care for the head with the species of cure which are appropriate, until it is healed.
The restoration of the nose when it is broken.
You know that the nose is not broken unless both of its upper parts break at the same time, or one of them; for it has two bones: since its lower part is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and does not happen to it except by rubbing, and tortuosity, and asymmetry.
If one of its two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger in the nose's hole, and make it equal with your own finger, and your thumb closed, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and let it be done with ease. And so that it does not happen to him during your operation that he suffers from pain on the sick bed.
That if the break is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that finger: then you must make equal the end at which there is a little thickeness.
But if the break is in the two parts, then make it similar to that one: and follow with its restoration on the first day when it was broken, if it is possible. And if not, then on the seventh day, or the tenth near the quiet of the apices hot.
Then put into the extremities of the nose the li-chinium from a cloth, if it is broken in one part: or put two li-chinia if it is broken in two parts: and sit in the li-chinium with such a quantity as fills the hole of the nose.
And certain ancient restorers said, let the li-chinia be poured into butter, and be changed every day. That is not really what I think should be done, however, it is necessary that the li-chinium be poured into the albus (bone) with the powder of the grinding, when it is thoroughly mixed. Then let the li-chinium go, until the os (bone) hardens, and the cartilage is hardened.
And when a feather of an goose is put in the place of the li-chinium, after it has been wrapped in a soft cloth; and it is done, so that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and does not prevent the sick from inhaling.
This is not necessary. If you wish, do so: and if you wish, make it with li-chinia.
That if the nose should again be injured while you are operating on an apostemous wound that is hot, bandage it with wax, or with a cotton wadded up with rose-oil, or with a little of dacquilion.
But if the apostema is not hot, then it should be bandaged with a powder of sisa-me, and the powder of the thuris that has been made into paste with albus (bone) be applied to it. Then put a soft cloth on top of it, and do not bandage the nose with anything at all.
But if the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, then you should split them open, and extract the bones with the instruments that are suitable for this purpose. Then cut it off, and take care of the flesh that has become incarnate, and consolidated from the bandages that are suitable for it, or with a paste.
If a fracture occurs between the nose and upper lip, then one should treat it with lint, and administer a plumb-lined catheter until healing occurs.
¶ On restoration of the lower jaw, when broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and not connected to the upper jaw, and it does not break into two pieces and does not hurt on the inside: then one can easily recognize it.
So, if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, insert your left index finger into the mouth to feel: likewise, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert your right index finger: and push it from inside with ease towards the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone, and adjust it straight.
If the fracture has already separated into two parts, then one should administer external pressure from both sides, straightening it out: until adjustment is possible.
But if a tooth has already been disturbed or broken off: then tighten them with gold wire, silver, or silk. Then place a poultice on the fractured jaw. Then place a double-layered cloth over the injury, and a large piece of skin cut to match the length of the jaw.
Then tie it from above, as you have prepared the binding material, and let it rest until it does not hurt: and instruct the patient to use a soft diet.
But if you think that some of his features have changed in any way: then adjust it and remove it on the third day. Then straighten out what has been disturbed and cover the injury with flour that has been sieved or ground wheat, after you have removed the poultice: and place a layer of wool over it.
While that wool remains attached to the injury and the bone's position does not change, let it be, and do not remove it, until healing occurs: or tighten the fracture. Many times this fracture is tied up with seven threads.
For if during the time between then and now a warm apoplexium occurs, then administer to it what we have said many times in sedating it, until it removes that apoplexium.
And if the fracture is with the ulna, consider. Nam if a fragment has separated from the bone, or if it is from a saw-tooth: then be careful in this case so that you remove those saw-tooth fragments with that which comes with you when you take them off from the instruments.
But if the wound of the ulcer is tight, then enlarge it with a phlebotechnition according to the quantity of your need.
Then when you remove those saw-tooth fragments, and if none remain, then close that wound if it is wide; and if not, put on top of it the plasters which suit it, and let it flesh over, until it heals.
As for the restoration of the fork, when it breaks.
Much of the time the Fork breaks from the front part of the shoulder, and its fracture is made in one of three ways.
Or if it breaks and separates into two, except that they happen to fall into saw-tooth: and it is easier to restore it.
Or else, so that they happen to the saw-tooth bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Or else, so that the fracture is with the ulna.
And the operation in it when the fracture is without the ulna, is, that you make these two ministers hold one another, so that the broken Fork has a support on one side, and the other extends the neck toward the side.
Then make the fractures of your fingers equal, until it takes its shape according to what is needed: and do not leave a protuberance in it, nor a depression.
But if you need to extend it more, then it is necessary that you put under a tickling sphere of cloth or wool: and make its size according to the quantity of your need: and extend it, and close the Fork, and hold the sphere with your hand, until it takes its shape, according to which you need.
If you cannot bring the end of the furcula to the outside, since it has gone deep inside: then let the sick person lie on their back on a tray; and place the fulcrum under their shoulder blade in the middle in size, and press down the minister of their shoulder to the lower part, until they lift up the jaw of the furcula that is in deep to the top: and then adjust the fracture straight, and make it equal with your fingers.
If you feel a lump in the furcula, and it moves: then let you find on it, and pull out the lump with ease.
If it is stuck in the bone, then use the incisorium you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the furcula an instrument that keeps it apart: and this instrument is made of wood, or of iron. And this is its form.
It is joined to the cochlea where it is not closed.
And its width should be according to that in which you sit, of the size of the bone, and of its shape. The length also should be according to what is possible for you in the work.
And it has two ends, as you see: and one end is wide, and the other is narrow.
If the break in the bone that you made when you pulled out the lump is wide, and secures with the warm thread: then join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
And if the break is small, or you have no warm thread: then fill the wound with rags, and dust, according to the quantity of the cut in the flesh.
If it happens that the warm thread has run out: then pour the rag in oil of roses, and vinegar, and wine, and place on it.
The stricture of the bone, when it is without a wound, and without a cut, is, that you place on the bone a plaster made from milled flour with alum. And place a beam of wood on top of it. Then put the ball under his tickle, if you wish it. Then take the hemolate, that is, the wheel which the Saracens hold, which is long and wide: and let the width of it be that of a palm, or about that. Then put a doubled pillow on the bed and a cushion. Then take an astel from a thin table, the width of which is that of three fingers, and in length also similar. Then roll it up in a cloth. Then roll up the cloth with the Astel in the place of the bone which fell on the fracture and the spot. Then put the bone on the fracture like a roll, and roll it up over his neck, and under his tickle, healthy and sick: and reduce it over all parts, and see how the stricture holds the fracture, and that is why it does not obscure you, and all, so that it does not move the Astel from above the broken bone. And for this, it is necessary that you should see the sick person every day. Whenever therefore the ligament becomes soft, and you see the Astel has moved a little: then make it right again, and tighten the ligament.
Then put a light sleep on his back, and under his tickle put a small pillow near his side so that he may be helped by it from his side when he wakes up at night. Thus is the fracture of the forearm healed by the elevation of the shoulder.
Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the ligature, if it does not happen in place due to a scratch, or from an appointment, until twelve days have passed.
Then put back the cushion, if you see his face towards that. And add to the stricture, and let him go, until he is restored and coagulated.
And the fracture of the forearm is tightened and healed after about fifty days: and sometimes it happens in some people sooner.
De restoratione fractura spatulae.
Rarely does a spatula break, and in that case it is on the side; and it does not break from it except for its edge.
When it does break from one side, and breaks in the middle of it, and is not known except by touch: then, according to its figure, prepare the treatment. And reduce it back to its natural position by all the skill you can muster, which is possible for you to do.
Then put on the wound a poultice of flour damped with alum, and a chip board, and place on top a bit of cloth double- layered. Then put on the table over it a thin iron stake according to the length of the spatula in question, or a larger one if needed.
If the broken end of the spatula is under a stake, then make it equal with the chip board, until the stake comes down to the right level.
Then tie it up with long threads, a little tight, and with the firmness of the stake, until it does not move from its place.
And consider the ligature every day. Whenever the ligature softens, tighten it again, and make the stake equal if it moves from its place: and let the injured one lie on the sound side.
And a spatula is restored in twenty or thirty days.
When this number is complete, then loosen the ligature: and you shall be safe. For that is of bone, whose joint is not afraid, and its release is not feared.
But if it proceeds from the end of a bone, and prickles under the skin: then cut off on top, and take it away. And do as we said in the fracture of a fork from sitting on a hot thing, if something happens from it.
Chapter VII. On the Restoration of a Fractured Pectoral Bone.
The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of its own self, and this rarely happens. The extremities of the body are indeed most subject to breaking, and are destroyed by the accidents that befall them.
When the middle of his chest breaks, which turns downward toward his lower extremities, then a great pain happens to him, and difficulty in breathing, and perhaps he spits up blood, and it becomes evident that there is a fracture in one of his bones, and it does not conceal its sensation, The restoration of him is so that he should lie down on his back: and put between the blades of his hands.
Then he should press his shoulders and gather the ribs from both sides with his hands: and gently adjust him to the right position, in whatever way is possible for that to be achieved, so that he may recover his rib cage shape, as it should be.
Then he should place over himself an embalming cloth and a mat, and put under him a wooden board from a thin piece of wood, or a similar one, in a state of levity, after you have wrapped it in a cloth. Then gently adjust him with a ligature over the broken bone so that it does not move: and sometimes, with the ligature following the curvature to his back, and tighten him by tightening it on the falling.
Then consider the ligature every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it: and if need be to relieve a skin itch, or corrosion which has occurred in that place, or pain, or swelling: then approach and loosen it, and remove the embalming cloth, and set right whatever has happened during the course of its cure.
Then reduce the embalming cloth, if you see it fit to do so: and attach a ligature, until he is healed.
The restoration of ribs, when they break.
You should know that rib fractures do not occur unless in the large spaces behind the back, and from the ends of the ribs on the anterior part. And it does not happen to them through friction, unless because they are cartilage. And the knowledge of this does not hide from the sense in inquiry when the fingers are used.
And the restoration of it is made so that the fracture with the fingers is equal when possible, until it is equal in form, according to what is necessary. Then put a splint on and tightly bind the broken bone with a stick, if it needs it.
And if the fracture is of the ribs and it has broken open into the inside: then there comes a severe pain to the sick person, and a puncturing, as that which happens to him who has pleurisy: for the bone rubs the membrane, and also there comes to him a difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and much blood. And this is a difficult cure.
And the ancient people have devised many methods in it: and from them are those who say, put on food that generates inflammation and ventilation, so that the abdomen is inflamed, and spread out, and driven out the fracture to the outside.
But we reject it, so that there is no cause for making a hot poultice quickly, unless it happens. But if it has already happened, then add this to it.
And some of them said: put on a place that is windy, and then blow upon it with force, and it is like the reasoning. But they fear that the wind will draw away the fluid to the place, because of the weakness of the disposition.
And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been immersed in hot oil: and put feathers between the ribs, until it is filled up: so that the binding is equal when it is turned round.
Then the sick person will be cured by the curing of pleurisy from food and medicine.
That if he binds the sick person who hurts him, which he does not bear, and the bone rubs the membrane, and we fear for the sick person: then it is necessary that we should split the place, and discover the broken rib. Then let us place upon it an instrument which conserves the soft part, whose memory precedes: and let us incise the bone with ease, and let us incise itself.
Then let us gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large with stitches: and let us dress it with plasters, until it is healed.
That if during the time there happens to be a hot swelling, then let it come forward, and pour dust in oil of rose and place it on the spot: and let the sick be dressed with it as is fitting for the swelling.
At the same time also let it rest upon its side where it sleeps, until it is healed.
De restoratione fracture spondylum dorsi et colli.
Of the bones of the neck when there happens to be a fracture, and rarely does it happen that they are worn away: and likewise of the vertebrae of the back. So then if it happens to someone and you want to know, whether it heals or not: then trust it. For if you see its hands already softened, and stupefied, and dead: and cannot be moved nor extended, nor pressed together: and when you press them with your fingers, and prick them with a pin, it does not feel nor does it hurt: then know that it is not healed, and in many respects it is mortal.
That if it moves them and feels the constriction with your fingers and the prick: then know that the bones of the neck are healed, and that the sick person will heal with treatment.
That if it is similar to that of the spine and neck, and you want to know whether it heals as well or not: then consider its feet: then if you see that they are softened, and what happens to them as happens in the hands: but when he lies on his back, he walks with a swaying motion and without will: and when he is placed upon his stomach, he wants to drink, and cannot: then know that it is mortal. I therefore will not detail his work in curing him.
If nothing at all happens to him from this, the matter is lighter.
And the cure of him that happened from it is, as you know, a sedative for boils of heat: so, as you put on oil of rose only spined: or when you walk with a man who has been bathed.
Place over that again a few times in the day until it is well sedated: then place over the spot one of the comforting plasters, drying up, and tightly bound to it with a bandage: and order the sick man to use quietness and tranquility. And let him not lie on the part where he feels pain until it is well healed.
That if something happens to the bone that has become separated, or anything that has already been separated from it: then you must let the wound heal over, and remove it. Then take two pieces of skin, if it is large, with a stitch. Then the cure for him with something that has become inflamed, with ointment, until it is well healed.
If afterwards the bone of the hand is broken and the end is cut off: then you must put the thumb of the left hand into the joint, and with the other hand, as well as possible, and in the second case, equalize it.
Then place over it, and take it off: and the cure for fractures with the preceding cure, until it is well healed.
The restoration of bones.
CHAPTER XI.
Bones rarely break. If they break, then the fracture is not, unless it splits at the ends of the bones: and they split along their length, and bend inward towards the inside: and the injury to the foot that breaks makes a pain in the place where it is, and it bleeds.
And the restoration of it is, as you stretch your hand over it, until you are standing on top of the fracture; which is shown in this figure.
If the fracture is only in the extremities of it, then make that fracture equal, according to what was prepared for you from equality, until its figure becomes similar to its natural one.
If the fracture is along its length, or has already turned towards the insides: then make the patient lie on his stomach, until the restoration of that fracture has been prepared for you. When you have made that equal, place over it a plaster; then place over it a wooden support, or a skin, and tightly tighten the bandage over what you do not fear a change in the fracture, and do not remove the support.
And make that equal concavity with it so that it fills it, until it takes it by means of the equality: and order the infirm man to sleep on his back, or on his healthy side.
If, however, he has a hot swelling: then cease from extending it, and also from its restoration, until it subsides: and place over him what he sits, according to what preceded, and then return to its restoration: and tightly bind him as it should be.
If, however, it has broken through the bone, or has been crushed, extract it.
The assistant for the restoration of a fracture.
The aide is that which is between the cradle until the head of the spatel.
If, however, it breaks, then its restoration is according to two ways.
Of which one is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
And bind together with two ligaments at both ends.
Then hang it from a raised place: and let the infirm man sit on a chair. Then let him throw his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches up to its knot, into which is attached a piece of wood.
Then hang it from above the man with something heavy so that he can extend his hand towards the bottom. Then let the physician bind the break with bandages, until the fracture has healed, as is required.
And another mode is so that the sick person lies on his back on his chest: and his hand is suspended from his neck with a rope. Then order two servants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other holds below him, and extends each of them on his side.
And if you wish that the extension be stronger, then tie under the fracture with a rope, and above it with another rope: and let each of the two servants extend them on their sides.
If then the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it is necessary that there be one rope under the collar-bone, and another rope under the fracture opposite the shoulder.
And likewise if the fracture is near the hip: then it is necessary that there be one rope over that place, and over the hip itself.
Then bind the fracture with ease without work, until such time as it is equal to that which is required, and applied in a good way: then tie it, if there does not occur a swelling of heat.
But if a swelling of heat occurs, then dismiss the binding until the seventh day. And place on him a woolen cloth soaked in vinegar and olive oil, until such time as the swelling subsides: then bind it: and the mode of binding it is so that you place a sponge over the fracture.
Then place on him a new cloth for washing out above the sponge. Then make the arm rest on the side of his body, and let him place his hand open on his shoulder.
And place the cloth, and tie over the arm as if to support the arm by the stars: if he does not prevent you from doing so, nor should anything change on him or in you that is broken.
That if you should find that anything changes on him or in you that is broken, then use the stars: and it is as if you place on the fracture a star which is broader and stronger than the others. And place between every hand-span a finger's width; and make the length of the hands according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every part.
Then bind tightly on top of the hands the constriction which I have said at the beginning of the chapter.
And let it be, so that your constriction is tighter over the site of the fracture. And as much as the fracture is lengthened, the constriction is less tight.
But if you see that the hand-spans are longer and the constriction is looser, as we have said, in the hour when you restore the member to life immediately then do so: but if you wait for the swelling to go down, then remove the constriction and the hands until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then consider the tendon for all three days, so that there does not remain any itching or swelling at the site, nor does it prevent food from reaching the member because of the inflammation of the swelling. So adjust that entire thing as we have said.
But if you are in doubt, so that nothing comes out of it: then do not remove the tendon, until after three days or more.
And let the nurse lie on her back and her hands on her belly; and place under her head a bed covered with wool evenly distributed.
And consider every hour of the night or day so that the broken member does not come loose, nor do the ligaments soften. So adjust that entire thing with your skill.
And provide the nurse with food according to the order which we have set out, so that there is a light meal at first, until the jaw begins to close: then it should be increased, so that he gains weight.
For the tradition of the aide and the limb is that it be bound for forty days; then it should be released, and given a bath, and treated with ointment which straightens it out.
If the fracture is putrid or worn away then do not remove the tendon and the hands until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ On the restoration of fractures of the arm (brachii).
The arm (brachium) is composed of two bones, which are called the two "focilia".
One is small, and it is that which follows the thumb. The other is large, and this one is placed below the little finger on the lower side.
Perhaps therefore does break only the larger  "focile", or the smaller; and perhaps do both break at the same time.
When therefore does break the smaller "focile" from above, then is the restoration of it easy, and its healing is easier.
And when does break the lower "focile", it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
And worse is it, when both bones break at the same time.
If therefore is broken only a small "focile" on the upper side, then should the doctor be present at the restoration of it, in order that he place the long arm with ease until it is even.
However, if only the larger "focile" has broken: then should he place a tighter fastener with force.
And it is necessary to place the form of the hand at the restoration of it, and its long extension above the wrist. And let the thumb of the hand be placed on its higher side for all the fingers; and let the flexor be placed for all the fingers, or any other; and let the person sit on a square before himself, or facing it, or directly in front of it, at an equal height, so that he does not suffer trouble.
Then he should extend the arm from its lower side, or with his hand, or with a bandage. And another minister should extend from above in the same way.
Then the doctor should even out the bone, until he reduces it according to the best form that he can obtain.
If also in the fracture of the bone are seen pieces (shards), then should you endeavor to reduce any fragment in its place with your skill.
If there appears to be a sathium or separate body part, and you stab the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find over it, and take it away according to the way that we have said in those that precede these.
But if there is a fracture with an arrow, I have already done to that separate chapter, so take the cure of it from there.
That if it should happen in the beginning of your restoration a warm apostematon, then make a thin cloth with a bright color made from oil rubbed, and white, and sit between the thickness and subtility: and tighten the cloth on the strictness with subtlety, until when it sits down the apostema: then remove the caerums, and put an preparatum emplاستر from dust of molendini with albumin. Then put on stars, and let the star that is put on the fracture be wider a little, and stronger: and
And you should know that the number of stars of the arm is six in several dispositions: whether it is a fracture in one ray, or in two rays simultaneously.
Then put on your stricture over the place of the fracture stronger and more painful, and a little more with the stricture to the upper fracture, or to the lower one: or put on a softer stricture of stricture somewhat, according to what preceded the memory of it at the beginning of the chapter.
And let there be cloths that envelop the fracture, soft, wet: and not hard, rough. And let there be a thread that is tied up with linen its own, between the thin and the thick, as we have described.
And consider the limb and the ligaments after days. That if anything should happen which requires a correction, such as itching that happens to a limb: then let the member be immersed in warm water, until that itch is quiet, and remove the member not constricted, until it is quiet, and then repeat the stricture.
That if the stricture has already been softened, and the bone has already been removed, and similar things: then correct all that with your virtue, and consider again.
If nutrition is forbidden to reach the limb because of excess tightness of the scar, then it is necessary that you make it soft a little and leave it for a few days until it heals, and then bind it tightly.
But if none of what we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary that he be cured unless after twenty days or so.
Then the patient's hand should be hung on his neck. And the patient's neck should be kept level, and he should be guarded with his own strength from sudden movements. And let him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and perhaps it is restored in fifty-six days. All of this depends on the condition of the wound and the strength of the patient.
On the restoration of fractures of the Hand.
Know that it is rare for a fracture to occur in the palm or the knuckles of the fingers. And this does not happen to him unless he has a great deal of rough usage.
But when a fracture or a sprain has occurred, then the sick person should sit on a chair with his back straight, and in front of him should be placed a second chair at the same level. Then put the patient' hand outstretched on it.
Then let the physician extend the bones that are broken and make them equal, until such time as they join together well.
Then it is necessary that an ointment and a bandage be placed on it if there does not occur a feverish swelling. Then place the splint from above on him according to the amount of space required; and you have already wrapped it with linen cloth.
But if the fracture is lower down around the root of the palm, then make a sphere-like shape out of linen cloth; and instruct the sick person to wrap his hand with it when he has a fracture; and then bind it tightly with the cloth.
And let it be placed on the skin, where it is soft, so that it adheres to the body of the plant: and bind it fast, as may be necessary.
But if the fracture is to the outside, then it is right: that you put one splint from above, and another splint from below in the plant: and let the hand be open straight. Then put on the splint, as the hand opens out: and spread it between the fingers with a bandage.
That if any fracture should be to any of the knuckles of the fingers, then it is equal as to what is necessary: and if it is the thumb, so let it be. Then bind it with the plant: and if you love, then put a straight splint on it, so that the fracture may be held fast, and not move.
But if the fracture is to any of the other fingers, as to the middle, or the index, or the auricular, or the annulary, then it is equal, and bound with the finger which follows it: or all be bound according to the continuation: and that is better. Or put a splint above it, as we have said in the thumb.
And consider in your restoration, and after that disposition apostematici heat: and oppose with it what is necessary, when anything happens of that, according to which its narrative returns.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the hips.
The hip bone is often broken, and is felt by touch: because it turns towards the inner and back parts.
And the restoration of it is such that one ligature is bound above the fracture, and another below the fracture. And the sick man shall stretch himself on his face.
Then let every ligature be extended to its side for equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
But if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let there be a ligature on the side towards the pelvic bone, that it may bend upwards: and a ligature below the fracture.
And so likewise if there is a fracture in the vicinity of the knee, then let him sit on the nearby ligament of the knee, so that he sits with an extension downward.
Then the physician shall adjust the bones of both hands until he has reduced them in accordance with the natural figure; and he shall join the bones together with a good joint.
Then it is necessary that you should put on plaster and bind it tightly, if this does not happen to the member by aphemia. That if it should happen to him by aphemia: then dismiss him for a few days, until the heat subsides; and then return to your healing.
But let the bandaging be such as It is necessary that you should wrap up firmly over the fracture, that is, bind it: and double it twice, or three times; and leave off from it what is superfluous. Then wrap up the leg, until it has grown to the root of the bone.
And insert a long thread between the coxal bone and the leg near the knee joint downward, and make the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two limbs. Then wrap up firmly over the leg and the coxal bone what is superfluous from the sash.
Then put on top of the coxal bone, at the place of the fracture, the wooden slats; and put out of them one wooden slat over the bone of the thigh.
Then fill with plasters between the leg and the coxal bone with soft rags, so that the bandaging is even.
Then begin with the strong bandage from the middle at the place of the fracture three times, or four times. And the longer you extend it with the ligament from the place of the fracture, the less and softer, and softer will be your bandaging.
Then introduce the thread at both ends, which you have inserted between the coxal bone and the leg. Bind on then with the three wooden slats that are above. Then move the two ends of the thread downward, until you reach the heel of the foot. And when you have bound both ends of the wooden slats on either side as well: so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Then release the ligature upon it while it remains, so that there be no corruption of the member, nor aphthae, nor swelling, and such things. If anything should happen from it. Then with the solution put on it, and straighten out what has happened there completely, as we have said many times.
But if a fragment of bone should strike the bone: then it is necessary that you make it even, if it is possible for you. And if not, find on it, and move it: and take care with it, that there be remembrance of the one who preceded it, until it is healed.
And when this fracture of the hip is tightened, except that they are added to it pegs, as we have said in the arm and wrist.
But in restoring it so that the fracture is not there, there is no limp. And if it is restored alone, except that another leg is applied to him, then he must always limp who has the one which is restored.
And you should know that the hip is tightened in fifty days, or a little is added to it, or a little is worn away: all of this is according to the variation of the complexion, and the remaining dispositions.
Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the knee joint of the leg.
You should know that the fracture of the knee joint of the leg rarely happens, but it often happens to him that he is worn away.
But if a fracture has happened to him, then there is either a crack, or a hole in its parts. And it is with the ulna, and without the ulna. And he will stand on it all with a sense of measure.
And the restoration of it is so that it adjusts what has been broken from its parts with fingers, until it comes together, and joins together according to what is possible from equitation and ease, and manufacture.
Then put on plaster from fine flour, or grind it with egg white: and put on a round peg above it, if you can bear that one: and tighten very well with a fitting to it.
Then consider all the arrangements which we have mentioned in the remaining fractures: such as the swelling of heat, and others like that: so that you oppose to every accident with what is appropriate to it, until it is healed.
The restoration of a fractured limb
You should know that there are two bones in the limb, one is thick and called "Crurus" by name, and the other is thin and called "Focile" by name.
And it happens to both species of fracture that occurs in the two bones of the arm: and because of this, its restoration is made as restoration of the equal arm, and the operation is one.
If both bones break at once, the limb becomes disabled in all parts.
And if the thin bone breaks, the limb is disabled on its front side.
And if the thick bone breaks, it injures what is below it: and is of those which do not hide from you.
Then administer extension, equalization, and binding of the joints according to the equality thereof.
However, if the fracture of the limb is a bad fracture, it has many complications: so that its extension is smaller, and less painful to you.
And in the limb itself is from the operation something on the arm: and it is, as when you equalize the joints, and perform all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood, which is administered in the fabrication of sockets that are placed under the tables: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose from them which have little thickness, and there are none of the small ones: and let be the length of them according to the length of the limb from the knee down.
Then wrap it up on one sheet of cloth, twice, according to its length. And place one side of the limb from one side, and the other from another side: and let be from the knee down to the foot.
Then bind the two strips in three places from the two extremes and the middle. For since constriction is prohibited, the knife tilts towards the right and left, and remains in good position.
And indeed the cuna-board is to be set from wood according to the length of the thigh, and placed therein so that it may preserve itself from motion.
And indeed you must do this much, that you make the break when it is a proper fracture.
Then consider the thigh day by day, and with great care watch it carefully for any swelling, or inflammation, or anything else. But if anything happens to it, then oppose it to it as much as is needed until it heals, if God wills.
Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and the fingers.
The heel bone does not have a fracture in the center.
But the bones of the foot do happen sometimes when there is a fracture, and the fingers also happen sometimes when there is a fracture; but they do not happen to them unless it is from overuse in many situations.
If it happens to the bones of the foot and you see those bones slip over each other when you walk, then let the sick person put his or her foot on the ground prepared, like a walker.
Then stand you, and place your foot on that which lifts itself from those bones; then press, or trample it; and make it even, until it returns to its place.
Then put a splint on, and wrap it up; and place under the thigh a thin board which has two flat heads.
Then tighten it with a tight strap when you wrap it, and with anything else that is needed; and release it gradually as the leg gets better.
But after three or four days have passed, then loosen the ligaments. For you will find bones that are even, or if they are fractured, or out of place. Then the operation on them is as follows, as you see it.
But if some of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make even the others according to what I have told you in the restoration of finger bones of the hand. Then take your finger and make a splint according to the length of that finger, and make it wide enough: then place this plate under the foot as I told you, and tighten it well.
If, however, what is broken is made up of two or three or more bones, then place a splint over the whole length of the finger, wrapped in a linen cloth: and fasten the plate to the foot below: and let it stand on one head of the table outside the navel of the foot, so that it holds well with retention.
And it will be for you to remember, so that you do not forget, all that I have told you about the other broken bones from the accidents which we mentioned: and oppose every accident with it as much as is necessary.
Regarding the fracture of a woman's pelvis, and of the ribs, and of a man's thigh-bone.
When the pelvic bone is broken, then make her sit square. Then lean her back a little towards the side of her spine, and let her be held from behind.
Then fill the woman' pelvis with cotton until she is filled: and let her be made round in the pelvis from that.
Then the woman should be raised, and her back should be raised little by little. For this cotton will come out, until it is in front of the woman' door like a ball, and the broken jaw will return.
Then place a little pillow on her back. But when she wants to urinate, the cotton will move easily with ease, and then she will urinate: and reduce it according to the way in which you put it in at first: and then bring it back to her little pillow again.
Let it be for seven days, or about, for the jaw itself will be restored: for this bone itself will be healed.
And if you wish, take a piece of oak, and make it go through a hole with an awl, and put the whole oak into her pelvis. Then blow into the tube with power, until the vessel bends within the cavity, for the fracture returns.
Then fill it with cotton, and let it stand a few days, as we have told, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the chest breaks for a man or woman, then administer to it what we have related in the restoration and adjustment of that which we have told concerning the bone of the breast.
And let not the rectum be hidden in those who are near to fracture, which happen little, especially if it is a certain study or use.
And understand my book very well, for the fracture itself means to you in many dispositions a straight course in the restoration of its own and a constriction of it: therefore understand.
But when the rod of a man breaks, take the throat of a goose: and introduce the virgate into it. Then put over him the wrapping of a cloth, and let it be wrapped up, and leave for three days, or about them, and he shall be healed, if God so will.
De restoration of fractures of bones, when it is with the arm.
It is fitting that he who has suffered a fracture with an injury, especially if it is great, such as the hip bone, or supporting bones, or similar to it, as you please, and let him stand immediately: if the conditions of phlebotomy are attested to you, such as we have mentioned.
That if the arm spurts blood, then it is necessary, as you please, to the dissection of it, so that it becomes powder on the top of it: if there is not present to you another.
Then begin to restore the fracture in that very day: and do not put off that which has been told, unless there is an apoplexy.
But if there happens to be a hot apoplexy, then dismiss the restoration of it until the ninth day, until it subsides. And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would make bad accidents happen to him.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin: then it is necessary for you to attempt to reduce this yourself, and make it equal with your hands with ease and a small extension.
But if the extension of it is not prepared, and its equality with your hands: then reduce this itself with this instrument. And this instrument is made of iron, the length of which is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight; and its width is according to the quantity of the wound. And because of this it is necessary for the doctor to take from them three, or four according to the quantity that he needs for the healing of all kinds of fractures.
And it should be round: and it should have a small thickness so that it does not double up under pressure on the top of it during the operation: and it should have an acute end at its ends, which has a edge at its ends. And let it be above its thickness from the middle of it to the bottom.
This is its form.
It is necessary in this operation, that the end of it be placed with a curved edge on top of the prominent end of the bone: and push it forward with a single force, until the bone returns and becomes equal with a certain equality.
So then take care to make the ends of the fracture face each other at right angles.
But if the ends of it are fragile, and does not take it by good purchase: then it is necessary for you, so that you can hit the end of its bone, until this instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce these with the instrument which we have mentioned at all, then strike it with one of the saws which we have spoken of: or saw it with a single saw in any way which is possible for you to do.
Then file away what remains on the bone from sharpness and small splinters.
But when the bone has been reduced and finds a painful and distressing aching after its reduction, then you should know that the bone has not returned to its own place.
I shall therefore translate this. For you have a great power of healing when your own bone is restored as you do it.
Then dip the cloth in vinegar, black. And especially if it is in the summer. And do not place any oil on the bone, nor anything else that might cause it to rot and腐烂。
Then administer the blood in your hour of restoration from the bone. And let the broken bone go: so that you may fall with a snap when the threads are loosened according to the quantity of injury.
And take all care, do not tie the bone with a fracture. For many times have the stoics made this mistake of tying a fracture bone: and they have caused to happen to their own infirmities or death, or corruption, or putrefaction, that is, rot. And may your own ligament be soft, gentle, very different from the stiffness of the fractured ligaments.
For if the bone is bad, or is a large bone, and you should bear some accident that we have described, and suspend pain in the place: then it is not necessary to tie bones to the bone. And make them solutions from dry cloths in the place of the bones, and tie the bone with them.
When it is after one day, or two days, and you see the bone has already begun to produce pus, then remove the cloth that you have placed on the bone with vinegar. Then administer leech, and ointments with which we are accustomed from our tradition to heal wounds, such as the tetrapharmacon ointment, and others like it.
And may it be convenient to you, that you break the ligaments. And consider the bone every day morning and evening until it is healed, and cured。
And it should be prepared for the limb in such a way that pus may flow out of it easily from below.
For if the wounds have passed many days, and are not healed, and no pus flows from them: then you shall know that there are little bones in it. How you should ask about the fracture with the tent. How much of those broken bones are separated, remove them, and pull out themselves. And which of those bones are not separated, and when they pierce the limb, and cause pain, avoid causing it, and remove it in any way possible for you that injury.
That if it happens to the patient that he is sore, or ekileten, namely, estiomenus, or any other kind of corruption and putrefaction: then you should oppose each one of them with what suits him in healing, whose preceding narrative is in his chapter.
And from that in which it is necessary that my speech should stand, and to which you shall direct your attention when the jaw is broken, and comes out above the limb, like the hip bone, and the auxiliaries, and such things from the large limbs, that is, so that you do not suspect attraction from it, for often happens from that death, besides leave it until it putrefies.
Perhaps indeed it will fall by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Then therefore heal the fracture if you can, and otherwise leave it.
On the Treatment of Knots in a Wound Frature.
This treatment has often occurred in a wound on the healing of a fracture. Especially, that which is near joints: and it nourishes from that figure of the member. And perhaps prohibits the member from its natural action.
Then consider, if that treatment is new: administer to it medicines which have a tightening effect, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and lead-ore, and acacia, and similar things.
So, that you take from these some, or all of them: and apply them with astringent wine, or with egg-yolk, or with vinegar: and place them on the treatment in a crucible, and tighten them with good compression.
And send away the bandage, and do not take it off for many days. Then untie it, and tie on another, until the swelling goes down.
Or fasten over it a leaden plate askew. For lead is the property that removes from the body anything feared.
But if the swelling has already set into the stone, and is rigid, and the need to remove it is urgent, then find on its upper part and cut off the prominence: or else saw it off with some chisel, until the swelling goes away: and take care of it, until it heals.
As for the curing, when it is restored, and remains a member after that, not according to its natural form.
When the fracture of a bone is restored, and remains a member after that, feeble: then it is not done for no reason at all. Of which one is that the multitude of the solution and the ligation of its ligaments is not according to what is required: or because of the excess of the bandage, until it is prevented from running food into the member: or because of the multiplicity of the unguents superfluous in not their time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body, and the weakness of it.
And its curing is, to feed the sick, and to make the body of it strong, until there is an increase of blood in it. And administer a bath. And introduce joy and gladness over it.
Then put a pin on the member: to attract the pin towards it for much food. And apply to it with frequentness the unguents with hot water, until it runs out for food, and returns to its natural form.
As for the curing of broken bones when they are restored, if they are twisted.
When it happens to a member that is restored after its curing, and there is a prominence of the bone, or swelling: and feeding it in the form of the member does not prohibit its natural function: then you should not take issue with it, that it will break again.
And there were also many stupid doctors and surgeons who did that work on our land.
And this operation is truly terrible, leading to death or a great fear, as it may be mortal.
But if the limp and sway are recent: then it should be soaked with warm water in which the soothing herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves of mullein, and the root of its kind, and the melon seed, and similar ones. And let there be made for him a poultice with a soothing plaster, such as that made from dyachil, prepared in the opposite way.
Or let the root of mullein be boiled with chicken fat or sise oil, and let it be applied with it.
Or let the young fig branches be taken, and boiled with fennel seed, and similar herbs that are called to decrease consolidation.
And when the sway has abated with diligent, old, and gentle massage, which is done with wet hands. And let the members of the body be moved in all directions during all hours.
But if the stiffness has already preceded and it is a strong one, which is turned into a rock, and an occasion has been caused to treat it with iron: then let the upper part of it be cut away, and the continuity of the bone be made whole, and what is superfluous from the stiffness or the bone with subtle incisions be removed, and ease be given to it with care and effort.
On the topic of Dislocation:
Dislocation is the exit of some joints from their place. Why it is restrained from its own motion, and is supported by the figure of the member. And it causes pain to the sick, and painful wounds.
When, then, dislocation occurs in anyone, let him hurry to repair it: and let him not delay it at all.
For if he delays it, the joint will stiffen, and with it the dislocation may be reduced.
For this reason, then, it is not fitting that he should stir or stretch himself out at the hour of his examination. For indeed he often causes a spasm to occur, and pains that hurt.
But when that does happen, then you should, as it were, approach the bleeding of the wound. Then let him be dismissed, until he is at rest from the seizure.
Then let the member be moistened with warm water and oil. Then let it be reduced with ease.
And let all the limbs be cared for with that which comes to its own place.
I have already ordered the chapters on dislocations, also according to what preceded it in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part thereof.
§ On the care of the dislocation of the jaw (mandible).
A little dislocated are the two jaws unless rarely.
And the dislocation of the jaw is made in one of two ways. Or indeed they remove themselves from their places with a little remote, and slightly soften. Or indeed they are dislocated with an entire, complete dislocation until they soften toward the breast, until the salivation of the wound happens, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and licks his tongue with speech.
When indeed its dislocation is little, then it returns of itself in many positions with a little ease.
But if indeed the dislocation is complete, entire: then let it be administered the reduction of it promptly, and do not delay underduringly: and it is, as it were, to hold the head in care: and let the doctor insert his thumb of his hand upon the dislocation between his mouth, if the dislocation is from one side. Or indeed let two thumbs be inserted simultaneously, if the dislocation is from two sides. And the other fingers of his hand are set outside, which make even.
And command the sick person to clean his jaws, and to free them for chewing on all sides. And let the doctor open his mouth wide, and push back the teeth, until it has returned to its place.
That if it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are involved: then administer steam with hot water and oil until it becomes easy to reduce the bars; and do not delay reducing the bars at all, as we have said.
When therefore they are reduced and become even, and the mouth is closed, and do not soften: then place on them cotton rags, with a wax that has been made; and oil of roses.
Then bind it together easily with soft ligaments.
And let the patient lie on his back: and his head be held between two cotton rags so that he does not move to one side or the other: nor is it bothered, or forced to chew anything: but rather let him have a soft diet, until such time as he can open his jaw; then let him eat whatever he wants, and give it to him easily.
Do not let him struggle with the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and whistling, until such time as the jaw has healed, and it is well.
That if it is difficult to reduce the two jaws when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places: then frequently there occur from it fevers, and sodas; and perhaps it dissolves the stomach of the sick, and perhaps it leaves pure cholesterol.
When therefore you see this: then know that it is a death sentence, and often he dies who experiences this within ten days.
Regarding the reduction of dislocation of the fork (furcula) and the extreme of the arm.
The furcula does not dislocate from the side due to the continuation of its connection with the breastbone. And it dislocates sometimes towards the outside: and reveals itself to the sense.
And his recovery is that he should lie on his back and extend his arms. Then wrap the place with your palm firmly, for it will come back.
Then put a plaster on it, and wool, and tighten it.
The extremities of him who is lying down, and continue with him, do not dislocate, except rarely. That which dislocates on a certain day: then it is necessary that you reduce and adjust it according to what we said, and that it is prepared for you.
Then put a plaster on it, and wool, and tighten it. And order the sick person to adhere to peace and quietness until he is healed.
And with this same cure, the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it separates also from its place.
De reductione dislocationis humeri:
You know that the shoulder does not dislocate unless by three methods.
Of which one is that it dislocates towards the tickling part towards the lower side. Second, is that it dislocates towards the chest side. And perhaps it dislocates towards the upper part of the humerus; and this happens rarely.
And does not dislocate towards the back, due to the spatula. And does not dislocate towards the front, due to the nerves.
And most certainly dislocates and moves towards the lower side towards the tickling part; especially in those who have little flesh there. Since it moves quickly out of them, and enters quickly.
But in those who have a lot of flesh, it is the opposite, that is, because it moves out with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
And perhaps happens to some people, a blow or a fall, and the humerus is dislocated by heat, and it is thought because of that, since it has already been dislocated.
It is necessary so that you should experience that, until you are certain about its state, and then proceed to its cure.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is directed downward towards the nipple: and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder. For you will see between them a great difference, and the dislocation of the head of the humerus has come together with it, and under the nipple there is a head of the humerus as if it were one itself: and an unhealthy person cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all its movements.
And in the same way, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upward: then there is a clear sensation of touch and it is not hidden.
And of this kind of dislocation the reduction is easy when it is recent, or when the person is a child.
And its reduction is such that it raises its own hand towards the sky. Then put your fingers under its nipple and open the reduction with strength upward to its place: and he will raise his own hand and extend it upward. Then let him put it down, for himself he will quickly recover.
But if he does not recover by means of what we have said, and there are many days from the time when the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the sick person bath in warm water, and be given a poultice which softens and soothes, such as if it were cooked alfalfa roots, and fenugreek, and melilot in water, and be applied.
Then let the sick person lie on his back: and let there be placed under its nipple a sphere and wool, which is equal to the length and width of the relief.
Then let the doctor put his heel on top of the sphere, and raise with strength the head of the humerus, and draw the sick person's hand downward by its side.
And if you wish, reduce him by this method: for it is such that the present man who is taller than the sick one shall stand by his side, and put his shoulder under the sick person' nipple: and raise the latter' nipple upward, until the sick person hangs in the air. And another minister takes the hand of the patient from below his knee. But if the injured person is weak then it should be so that something else is suspended with him, to prevent him from falling over: for displacement returns immediately.
And it is also reduced in another way: and this is that it should be so that a long piece of wood is placed on the ground, whose head is round: like a mortar's sleeve: it should not be thick or fine. Then place under the sick person a soft cloth after they are placed on top of the wood's head: and let the sick person stand in line with the length of the wood.
Then his hand is extended from the other side to the lower part of his body, and his body is extended from one side with strength: for the union returns to its place with speed.
That if his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this care: and this is that you take a piece of wood whose length is the amount of two arms, and its width is the amount of four fingers, and its thickness is the amount of two fingers: and its head should be round, to relieve its entrance into the deep crack, according to this shape.
Then soft cloths are tied over the round head so that they do not harm the wood to the sick person.
Then place under the crack a nurse who should extend his hand or arm over the wood to the lower part: and tie the wood on the support and arm and limb of the hand.
Then place an arm over the ladder's step by its width, and extend his hand to the lower part, and dismiss the rest of the body suspended from the other side. For the union enters immediately.
But when his entrance is complete in any way possible: then it should be so that you place under the crack a sphere of the same amount of wool. Then place an emollient made from pounded rose with olive oil and white powdery substance over the whole shoulder, as it rotates upwards from above.
Then tie the tourniquet above the pulse: and turn around the ligament over the poultice above: and attach his hand to his own neck, and let it go, and do not move his hand for seven days.
And it is necessary that food be given to the sick person in small amounts until his member is healed: for it is more speedy to his healing.
Then after seven or five days, let him exercise with movement. But if it does not soften and tighten, then he is now healed.
But if the joint dislocates often, because of the moisture that occurs with it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that he be administered a cauldron with six holes, as has been said in the chapter on the cauldron.
What if all this is done, and the ligament is released after seven days, and the joint does not tighten, and the poultice and constriction above him are relaxed a little, and does not harden, and falls down, and cannot raise himself upwards: then you should know that the nerves which are in the shoulder have been cut, or stretched out, or softened. And you should know that the joint never establishes itself in its place.
But the dislocation which occurs toward the chest and the nipple, or the reduction towards the back, takes place with an impact and extension with the hands: until it returns, and a remaining constriction and care is administered to it, until it heals.
What if weight occurs after healing in the member, and slowness in its movement: then the sick person should take many baths, until that weight is softened, and he returns to his own nature first.
On the Healing of Dislocation of the Elbow.
You should know that the joint of the elbow dislocates with difficulty, and also heals with difficulty; and it itself dislocates to all sides, and especially to the front or back.
And his dislocation does not remain hidden from you; for it is falling under the sight and under the touch, according to whichever figure it is dislocated. And when you join the dislocated bed with the sound one, that is declared to you manifestly. For the joint is twisted, and it cannot double the arm, nor can it touch with its shoulder.
And you should do so that you restore the dislocation immediately, before a fever seizes him.
For if a fever seizes him, his reduction is difficult; and perhaps he does not recover at all, especially when it is behind. For it is worse in all forms of dislocation, and more painful to him; and often he dies with it.
And the restoration of it when it is out of those things that can be reduced, is that he extends his hand with both hands; and his arm is spread wide, and his medial fingers are above the bed and under it, and he pushes back the dislocation with his thumb-tips or with the root of his palm, until he brings it back to its place.
Or the dislocation is to the front; then he returns so that he doubles his hand with his own, until he hits against the root of his palm with the bed which is dislocated.
Which if it does not obey the reduction, then administer a painful extension, strongly; and it is as if two ministers extend his arm: and they hold him also so that he does not move at all during the extension.
Then his arm turns back to all parts after it has been wrapt around his hand with a long piece of cloth, or a wide ligament.
And when the doctor touches his joint with his own hand, he smears it with oil: so that it is out of those things that assist in the lubricity of the joint with ease. Then he pushes back the dislocation with a forceful impulse, until he brings it back.
And after the reduction of it, let there be placed on it a plaster, in which is stiptitude, and drying with white of egg, and let it be tightened by tightening as it goes down. And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the nurse; and let it be discharged after a few days.
Then let it be unbound. But if the joint remains firm in its own place, then loosen the ligament from it, and discharge it itself.
And if you see that the joint is not well bound, then apply plaster again, and the ligament, and discharge it after a few days, until it is bound. Then let it be unbound.
But if he has put on weight after the joint has been reduced and it is still moving: then administer humidity in a bath, and a slight friction, and compression, until it heals, or put a poultice on the joint, that is, natrum arietis pinguem. Then bind it up, and discharge it over it day and night. Then take it off, and put the patient into a bath. But when he sweats, then bind the joint with a slight friction. Then apply the poultice one time on each side of the joint in entering the bath, twice more, and then a third time with the exit from the bath, until it becomes soft.
And if there is a wound, put on it clay that is damp, warm with butter, and bind firmly over it.
Perform this several times. For it will heal, and return to its own place.
The treatment of the dislocation of Albucasis.
When the hand is greatly displaced, that is, a joint between the arm and the hand is dislocated.
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy. But the other joints are relined. However, it should be so that the speed of its reduction from dislocation is at the time when the latter is dislocated, or that it happens while it is warm.
And the reduction of its dislocation is this way, so that you put Mahassem's hand, which is weak, on a table, and let it extend its finger, and let the doctor put his palm on the eminence of the joint, and push it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manos suae super tabula apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manos, tunc sit positiones manos eius intrinsece super tabula, id est, interior pars mano eius super tabula ponatur, ut cadat mano medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.
Indeed, it should be considered if the palm has already receded to the abdominal region of the hand: then place the patient's hand on a table with extension and reduction: and if dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then position the hand of the patient intrusively over the table, that is, the interior part of his hand over the table is placed so that the doctor's hand falls over that eminence of the joint.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manos, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi aut attriti.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius. Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.
Cum ergo non redit Albucasis, tunc pone super ipsum emplastra, quod narrauimus. Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitatior manos.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidit in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc lene eam cum aqua calde, et frequentia frigore, donec leniatur.
De cure dislocationis articulorum digitarum libet ut super illa praescribere moerimus.
Quando dislocatur ex eis digitus ad omnem partem, vel ex eis digitis ad dorsum palmae, aut ad ventrem eius: tunc extendite digitum, et impellite dislocationem pollicibus vos, donec redeat.
Then support the head of the digit and hang it from the side where it is dislocated for two days.
Then hang it and stretch it until it is even in that day.
When night comes on then bind him according to the above-mentioned description: and do not stop to loosen him in that day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Perform these days a few times, until it is taut.
And also do this with him, if the dislocation is towards the thumb: and bind it to the side, and perform your first operation on it, until it heals.
And also do this with him when dislocated towards the other parts.
The cure for back dislocations:
When a person has a complete dislocation of the spine or many vertebrae have moved from their positions then there is no cure for this illness because death looms over the sick person.
And the sign of this is that the sick person walks with a limp without wanting to, and cannot hold himself steady: and many of his limbs weaken a little, or two of his limbs, or two of his arms, or one of them; or a vertebra moves out of place from its position.
For many times a vertebra can move if it is moved too much, and these move to the four sides.
So the one that moves backwards is called A hunch.
The cure for this disease is that you consider then if hunch comes on during adolescence: there is no cure for it, and there will be no healing from it at all.
But in the one that comes on through age or injury or similar things, the ancient healers have long since taught methods of cure with many words. Of these many do not return with profit.
I however have shortened this from its origin, which would not excuse much of the length of his close relationship with mine towards intention: and my exposure of it when I showed it, and I formed an instrument of many ways to show him, and they displayed it.
I say then that in a hunchback which occurs from the anterior part, there is no skill or cure from it.
And likewise in that which happens to the two sides.
And should not be cured from them, unless that which happens in the back proper, with what I tell you now: and it is, so that the sick person lies on his face on a level platform close to the wall: and he spreads under him a damp cloth, so that his chest does not hurt.
Then a straight piece of wood should be placed in the foot of the bed, near the head of it: and another piece of wood should be held around the feet on the other side of the bed: and the minister should hold the wood, and not let it rest on the ground. And the other minister should hold the other one.
Then the nurse shall bend over his head and under his chin with a soft band, fastening it firmly: and she shall extend the end of the band to the wood which is near his head: and she shall bind herself in it.
Then another band should be tightened above his shoulders and above his knees, and near his ribs. Then all the bands should be gathered together and bound in the other wood which is at his feet.
Then the other minister should extend to the side of the wood the bands which are not fixed in their places: however, they should not be fixed, as we have said.
And the doctor should place his palms on the spine with firmness, until he has turned it round: or he should place them on the board. Then he shall set his feet on the board, until he has turned it round.
But if he does not turn by this cure, then take a board whose length is about three arms. And make a hole in the wall from which we speak, which is near the sick person, a place into which the end of the board shall go. Then put the middle of the board on the spine. And let the doctor put his feet on his own sides at the other end. And he should tie it well, until the spine is tightened, and return to his place.
Then if you want to operate with a tourniquet that is wrapped with your hand: and it is, so as to fix in the ground near the head of the patient two sticks, whose length sits in the length of one arm: and apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.
And the length that is between all stick pommel one: and it has been done in every place hole, where the tourniquet runs: and all wood hardens in the ground a lot, so as not to move at all.
And the round stick is inserted: and the tourniquet is in which the ligament revolves in two holes of two sticks.
And at the end thereof is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is with it that revolves: and on the other two sticks is also the same.
Then tie the ligaments that you tied inside the patient's abdomen with a tourniquet that is at his head: and the ligaments that you tied in his legs with a tourniquet that is at his feet.
Then stand next to every tourniquet, who twists his hand with a tourniquet, with which the tourniquet revolves: and the doctor equit Spondilem, according to what we have said.
This is the form of the tourniquet that follows.
Then after Spondilis has returned and his place has been equalized, then it is necessary to put dried blood clumps with albumin. Then stand up. Then put a board above the clumps of blood, whose width is three fingers wide, or around them. And its length is the quantity that takes the place of the gibbosity, and on the side of a healthy spine.
Then tie it with a ligament that we have said. And use it to feed the sick with subtle food until they heal.
If something remains of excellence in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that those be administered which are softening and relaxing, with the administration of the tablet which we described at a long time. And already it is being administered in that leaden plate.
And when something of excellence happens at the end of the spine of the back: and it is thought through that dislocation, and it is that bone which has already come out. Why should not presumption be made with this medicine: perhaps, however, it will happen to cause death.
[On the Treatment of a Dislocated Ankle.]
You should know that the ligaments of the ankle, and of the shoulder, do not occur, except when there is a dislocation; and they do not occur in them because of a small distance from each other, and due to friction.
And the ligaments of the ankle dislocate according to four parts. Because it dislocates towards the front and towards the back.
And much more it dislocates towards the inside; and little towards the front, and towards the back.
And the treatment of its dislocation towards the inside is this: because when you join the injured leg with a healthy one, it is longer; and the knee of the injured is more prominent than that of the healthy, and the sick cannot double his foot there by virtue of the warm spot which follows the hip.
And the sign of that for which dislocation has occurred towards the outside is this: its opposite accidents to these accidents.
And the sign of that for which dislocation has occurred towards the front is this: it expands the healthy leg according to its complement; however, it does not double itself without pain in the knee: and if he attempts to walk, he cannot go forward on it on the front side: and he retains his urine, and follows his hip with it, and during walking he stumbles on his heel.
And the sign of him in whom dislocation has occurred to the rear is that his knee does not bend before he bends both knees, and the bone of his leg is also shorter on one side: and the knee is softened, and the head of the femur is at the place of the hip.
The reduction, however, of this dislocation can be seen when you consider that if the dislocation is recent, it will have healed by the time it has been held in place. Then, if you administer the reduction and it remains in the same position: there is then no cure at all for it. Therefore it should not be assumed that he has a complete recovery.
In that person, however, whose dislocation is recent and who has only one of the four types of dislocation: then approach this, so that you can move it, and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it with your right and left hand: for it may well recover, and it will not require any further treatment.
If, however, he does not recover in this way, then you must prepare a strong remedy, and extend his leg from the lower part: or with his hands, or with a ligament that is tied above his leg; and another assistant should extend his hand under its heel so that he can place his hands under the heel of his foot. Then tie it with a soft ligament at the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other ligament.
And let him sit with his extension either from the front part of the groin to the hip, or from the back to the spine.
And let all these extensions move in one direction at first, until he raises himself with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
This type of extension is a common feature of the four types of dislocation.
If this dislocation is reduced with that which I have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to say of each species what I say about its own cure.
Indeed, when the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the weak one should lie on his sound side. Then put the ligament over the root of the hip, since it is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin. Then extend the ligament from the side of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the side of the fork.
Then another strong minister should take his arms, and he should make the place of the weak hip small, and he should extend it to the outside with a violent extension. For he has already returned to his place.
And this kind of treatment is easier than the other kinds of treatment for this member when it is reduced.
But if it refuses to comply with you at all when you treat it with this kind of treatment: then two nurses should be tied down together with a strong ligament, mild, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each from its own starting point be the same as that of four fingers: and let the calf of the infirm person be extended by two fingers' width more than the other.
Then hang up the infirm one on the head of the ligament, which is in the house: and let the length of him from the ground be the same as that of two arms.
Then order a strong youth to support the head of the hip: and let another hang with the infirm one: and let another push him from behind, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
But in reducing his own, when the dislocation is towards the outside, it should be laid that the infirm one lies on the ground, following which we have spoken about having a hunchback. And tie the ligament over his leg, infirm in itself, and over his chest.
Then two stakes should be put, one at his feet, and another at the head of him. Then put the wood added into the middle of his heel, fixed well: and let there be placed over it wet cloths so that they do not hurt the infirm one: and let the wood be between his hips, so that it does not draw towards the lower ones with the extension.
Then all the attendants should spread out to their respective areas, and the doctor should give a careful reduction by hand.
If he obeys in the reversion, it will be good.
And if not, put a board on it, and press it, as we have said in the case of a hunchback, equally. However, it is necessary that the sick man lie on his sound side.
And when the dislocation is in the front, then it should be extended quickly the leg of the nurse: and it is according to this that we tell about the platform: and the doctor puts his hand by his right hand on the hip of the sick person. Then he should grasp him with the other hand, and with that grasp place him extended towards the lower side of the knee.
And if the dislocation is at the back: then it is not necessary that the sick person be extended towards the lower part, and let him sit raised on the ground: but it is necessary that he be placed on a hard thing, as it should also be if his pelvis were dislocated to the outside, according to what we have said about his lying on two backs: and it is on his face, and the extensions of the ligaments: according to what we have said recently.
And it is necessary that compression be applied with a board even to the place from which the slip occurs, when reduction has been completed according to what should be done.
And the sign of his recovery should not be hidden from you: and it is as if you extend the two legs of the nurse: and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his own leg, and stretches himself without excuse: then you know that the member has recovered, according to what is necessary: then join the two hips together, and put a bandage on, and tighten it with the rope, that is, rotate it: so that it does not move the pelvis towards any parts: and let him adhere quietly for three days, or four.
Then undo the ligaments, and the bandage, and bring together the legs with each other: then if you see them equal in state, then you know that the dislocation has now been fixed: so let the sick person go, to walk about.
And if you see anything of healing: then return, and bind it, and tighten it according to your first rule: and also let it be for three days.
Then حلّه واجعله يتأخر في المشي على جانبين لعدة أيام، حتى يبرأ جيداً.
(On the Dislocation of the Knee.)
(On the Rotational Movement and Luxation of Joints.) The knee is dislocated in three ways. (Is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, namely to the rear.)
(And is not dislocated in front.)
(And the sign of its dislocation is that he who is sickly should apply his leg to his hip.) (If it does not adhere to the hip: then you shall know that the knee is dislocated.)
(And the restoration of all the modes of dislocation is so that you may make the sick sit upright, in such a way that he may extend his leg over it if he can, and fasten his back to his face: and place his foot between your feet.)
(Then fasten the knee of him with your palms, and make them straight between your fingers over his knee.) (Then apply your two palms to both sides of his knee with strength.) (And another person should extend his foot, until the knee returns to its place.)
(And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the hip with slowness, not painfully.)
(Then bind him up, and fasten his leg to his hip.) (Then bandage them together with linen for three days or four.) (Then solve them.)
(And let the sick person not walk for several days until he is healed.)
(If, however, it does not submit to your reduction, then administer a strong extension with the ligaments, of which there was a previous account in the cure of aching joints, until it returns.)
¶ On the treatment of a dislocated heel bone.
When the calcaneus is sometimes moved with a small movement, and when it is dislocated according to the complement. And this dislocation of his is, or towards the insides, or towards the outsides.
And the sign of this dislocation is, that you see the calcaneus swollen, projecting towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of this removal is, that it is easily reduced: and it is, so that it is extended with ease with the hands, and is made even, until it returns.
But in the treatment of this when it is dislocated according to the complement, you should make the sick one sit upright: and let him hold himself by a strong hand firmly from the back part of his spine, in the middle of his own.
Then hold him with your right hand on the upper part of his foot, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot, where the claw is.
Then pull his foot towards you with your right hand. Then with two fingers of your left hand.
Then extend with the left, and push the chest of the foot with the right towards the thigh without working.
Do this twice, as we have said.
Then push the chest of the foot towards the thigh with a third force, and you draw the claw out.
If then he returns in a single or second force, and you see the foot even, it is good: but if not, then repeat the operation over him: for he will return.
But if it is forbidden to you to reduce him with that which we have said: then let the sick one lie on his back on the ground, and fasten a smooth peg firmly in the ground, so that it may fall between his thighs: and you will now raise over him the cloth, so that he may not be hurt.
Then let the minister take the sick one's foot: then extend the other minister's foot, or with his hands, or with a band that ties over the foot's collar. Then let every servant stand opposite to the extension of his own body; and let a nurse stand between the two hips holding him back, so that his body is not drawn down towards the lower part at the time of extension.
Then the doctor shall make the servant's hands meet, and another servant shall hold the healthy leg from below. For the dislocation returns with speed.
When therefore the dislocation has returned, and when you have told me about its return in health; then put on a splint and a support, and tie it with ligaments tightly, and bind the foot with a ligament to the leg.
And it is necessary that you should beware and do not fear the nerves which are above the heel behind, lest there be a ligament over them that hurts them; and they hurt them.
Then let him go free for two days or three. That if the ligament softens, tie him up; and then dissolve him on the third or fourth day; and forbid the sick one from walking for forty days. But if he should try to walk before that space has passed, there is no security except that the dislocation be dissolved upon him, and that it be corrupted, and that he not receive after it any cure.
That if it should happen to him that he has a feverish swelling: then let you administer to him in a sedative that which we have related in another place of the cure, and an ointment, until it subsides.
On the Dislocation of the toes of the foot and its cure.
It is necessary that he should be made to extend slightly without working; and that this is not difficult, it is even easy.
But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the heel of the foot: then let the sick person stand his foot on an equal place of the ground, or on a board; and he shall walk as if standing.
Then you shall stand still, and let your foot be placed upon that which protrudes from the joint. Then that calcified bone with your foot with strength, until it returns, and the shape is now even, and does not appear in place eminence.
Then put under his foot that plate which carries the whole foot, which has two heads. Then tighten him with a bandage for three days. Then solve him, and let him rest from walking for many days, until he is tightened and secured from the reduction.
On the type of dislocation with a ulna or fracture.
When something like this happens to anyone, and he cares for his cure and restoration, many times death follows: and therefore it is not necessary for him to pride himself on the care of his wound, which is such, unless he is prudent in the art of long use, merciful, gentle, slow, not bold, and proud: and that he uses the medicines which sit upon the warm apostemes only: and lets go of the patient by divine judgment. Unless you hope for salvation from destruction with gentleness of illness, and where there appears some hope. Therefore consider the reduction of him immediately at the beginning of the thing, before a warm aposteme happens to him.
But if he returns the member, according to our order, then administer a regimen which sits upon the aposteme: and care for the ulna with him when it suits him out of the unguent of the desiccated.
That if the dislocation is with a fracture, and things happen in the osses of the sagittal separation, then consider the removal of them, and make him in it what we said in simple illnesses from what preceded in their places.
And bide according to your strength, and guard yourself from the entrance into a state of fear: according to which prophecy I told you.
For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring to your glory, and more safe to your body with them in your time.
