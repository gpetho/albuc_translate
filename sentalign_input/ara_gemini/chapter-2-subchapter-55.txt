Chapter fifty-five on the treatment of children who are born and places.
Their urine [opening] is not perforated, or the perforation is narrow, or in the wrong place.
Some boys may come out of their mother's womb with their urethra not perforated.
So it is necessary to hasten to perforate it from the hour he is born with a very thin scalpel in this way:
Then you put in the hole a thin nail made of lead, tie it and keep it for three or four days, and when he wants to urinate, remove it and let him urinate, then put it back.
And if you do not use the lead, it is possible that the urine that passes over the place will not let it close.
As for the one whose hole is narrow, it is treated with the lead, as we said, for many days until it widens.
And those whose hole is not in its place, that is, some of them are born with the hole at the end of the penis, so he cannot urinate forward until he lifts the urethra with his hand upwards.
And he is not born from the front because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line, and this is a very ugly condition.
The way to do this is to have the patient lie on his back, then stretch his penis with your left hand with a strong stretch, and sharpen the head of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel the size of a pen, or as if you were carving something so that its middle would be prominent, similar to a penis, and so that the hole would be in the middle as it should be.
And beware of bleeding during your work, for it often happens, so counteract it with something that stops the blood and treat the wound until it heals.
