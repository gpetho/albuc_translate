of the chronic pain of the head
When chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use irises and pills which are called "cochie," and purging of the head and oils and plasters;
and if the cautery that we mentioned earlier is performed, and it is not effective.
Take care if the patient's head (constitution) is of a strong nature, and that it is not too cold;
then cauterize it a little below the cautery that we mentioned above.
Afterwards, make a cautery on each temple of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "temples/vessels";
and it is a place where one puts cupping glasses;
and lighten your hand so that you do not go down to the bone:
the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the temples be more subtle/smaller/shallower than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the method/form:
