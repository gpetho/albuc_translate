O, children, since I have now completed this book, which is the latest work of the science of medicine, by the grace of God and the diligence of its followers, and by the proofs it offers, and by the declarations it makes, it seems to me that I must explain this treatise to you, which is part of my art, that is, surgery.
For in our age and in our land surgery is a perilous art, since great learning is required for its practice, and its secrets are very secret; and few men understand them except for a few small descriptions found in the works of the Ancients, which change everything and completely overturn the old errors and hesitations until they are explained clearly and the power of the art is extended
And it is seen by me that I have composed this treatise in such a way as to follow the way of demonstration and explanation and abbreviation; and that it may be useful to the forms of the instruments of cautery and other instruments of the work as well as for the addition of the declaration and for the preparation of the patient, which is necessary
But the most important reason why no good artist can be found in our age in this our time is that the art of medicine is long, and that it requires a great actor who has been exercised in the science of anatomy, who knows the structure of the limbs and the form of these, and the joints and their separation; and who has knowledge of bones, nerves and vessels, their number and their location, and of the pulse and veins, and the seat of their sensation.
And thus speaks Hippocrates, that in my name there is no lie, even in small matters, and especially in the art of the hand
And as I have said at the beginning of this book, he observed that he who is not learned in anatomy is not worthy of the title of physician, for he will certainly cause the death of many men through his errors, for many have perished from this very ignorance, for they have learned this science and abandoned the other.
For I have seen a foolish physician who, having incised an abscess of scrofula in the groin of a woman, has incised several arteries of the groin in order that much blood should flow, and the woman died between her legs.
And I have seen another physician who took hold of a stone from a man who had had it in his belly for a long time, and the stone was great, and when he came to take it out he pierced it with a piece of glass, and the man died three days later
And I have already mentioned this, that in such cases I know of no other remedy but to take away the stone, for the greatness of the stone and the condition of the patient makes death certain
And I have seen another physician who took charge of surgery for a duke from our land, and he owed his position to a black slave who had been accused of breaking his leg; and the physician, in his ignorance, attempted to heal the fracture with sponges and bandages, without allowing the wound to breathe.
And thus he died according to his desires, and he relieved himself, and he repeated this for several days, commanding that he be given no other food; and thus the limb was lost forever
And I went to see him, and I saw that the liament had been removed, and there was peace and an end to the pain
But indeed corruption was confirmed in the limb, for I could not restrain it, and I did not cease the corruption of the limb until the patient was in danger of death
And I have seen another physician who pierced an abscess of cancer, and caused ulcers nearby within a few days, so that the malignancy of the tumor increased with the master of the tumor.
The cause of this is that cancer is pure melancholy humor, and it does not suffice to bring it to an end with medicine, but that it must be treated by the limb that suffers so that the rest of the body may be saved
And thus, children, it is necessary for you that the art of surgery be divided into two parts: that which is associated with health, and that which is perilous in the greatest precautions
And I have already mentioned this throughout this book in which I have spoken of the operation in which there is error and fear; for it is necessary for you to guard against this and leave that, so that the fools may not find fault with you and you may be blamed.
Therefore take courage and ask for the help of God, and the sick with you for help and for comfort.
And thus, through the mercy of God, you shall be saved and blessed with abundant success, and you shall cast down the terrifying diseases that are difficult to heal, and you shall overcome the other weapons of that which you are afraid, so that you shall rejoice in your faith and in your name, for it is your reward that remains in your glory, and more so in this world and in the next.
Indeed, I have already mentioned this in many of my discourses.</end_of_turn> “There is no medicine for a bad disease, for so it is that many doctors will not be called by that name”.</end_of_turn
And indeed, I have already written this book according to three chapters.</end_of_turn
Begin the division of the book, and first of all of the first part.</end_of_turn The first chapter is ordered of the head downwards, concerning the forms of the instruments and the instruments of the cautery, and of what is necessary for the operation.</end_of_turn
The division of the second part.</end_of_turn The second chapter, of swelling and perforation, and of blisters, and of ulcers, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, is all capitulated and ordered concerning the forms of the instruments.</end_of_turn
The third chapter, of restoration and dislocation, and of the care of fractures and similar things; is ordered concerning the head downwards, and concerning the forms of the instruments.</end_of_turn
That I have said concerning the quality of the instruments of that cautery and of their documents, and in what combination it is prohibited to cauterize.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that the discourse concerning the quality of the instruments of the cautery and of their documents is a long and profound one, and subtle for science, and a secret hidden; and already many learned men have spoken about it, and they have disagreed among themselves, and to me it seems that little of what they have said is sufficient, fearing that it will be prolonged.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that cautery conforms to all universal completion except for two completions, which are caudal completions of its matter.
In the caudal and dry completion of the matter, disagreement arises; for some say that cautery is useful for that, while others say that it is harmful to that, because the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that the disease be both caudal and dry with that which is cauterized and dry is healed.</end_of_turn>
And I say that those who say the opposite are mistaken, that for cautery is useful in every caudal and dry disease that exists in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of a man with the humidity of his blood to the completion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
And I say concerning this discourse that I have already experienced something like this in my studies.</end_of_turn>
But indeed, I do not say that everything that has been said should be abandoned and neglected in the chapter of cautery after practice, and by knowing the diversity of the humors of men and the disposition of diseases in their places, and the causes of these, and their accidents, and the space of time of these.</end_of_turn
But in the other completions, it is not about you fearing, and more so in the cold and humid diseases, for already all doctors have agreed upon these, and they do not disagree concerning the usefulness of cautery in those.</end_of_turn
And know, my son, that the secret of healing with fire cautery and the wisdom of it is about cautery with acute medicine, for the fire is simple, the action of which does not reach beyond the member which is cauterized and does not notice the other member with it adjusted except for a small document.</end_of_turn
For the action of acute medicine reaches only to that which is inflamed, and it does not make it come into the diseased member of difficult healing and does not make it go out.
For fire, by its subtlety and its substance, does nothing but what is already known to us by experience and by the length of our service in the art concerning the truth of the causes; and for this reason I am excused from the length of this discourse because it is not legible to me in this place in this paper the secret which you have hidden with fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies and the safety of its expulsion of the disease, as it is demonstrated in philosophical terms.
Indeed, masters, it is known that the most opportune time for cautery and rest is during the milder days of spring.
I say that cautery is useful at all times, so that it does not suffer from the suddenness of the time, for it is immersed in the support of water which makes the cautery less painful, especially if the cautery is for pains or for necessary pains, for these are strong and fierce, and it is feared that if it is delayed, there is a risk of malice, which is greater than a slight discomfort that enters at the right time.</end_of_turn>
I do not know of other cases, or masters, where people except the vulgar people and foolish doctors think that cautery is not useful at all times. Therefore, for that disease which is healed by cautery, it is not ridiculous at all times, and rest is enough of that consequence.</end_of_turn>
And the cause is not that they say that it is for water, for cautery is nothing but a means of medicine which alters the complexion and dries up the humors which are the cause of pain.</end_of_turn
But indeed, cautery often surpasses medicine in its value and the virtue of its operation and the greatness of its benefit.</end_of_turn
And it is possible that your disease will return at some other time, according to the complexion of the disease and the location of its disease, and the virtue of these things, and what is prepared in the body of these things from the accumulation of superfluities in these things, and what is obtained from these things in their acquisition through food and drink and the like of these causes; but the disease in which cautery is administered is a subtle disease in few superfluities and humors, just as if it were cautery for pain and the like of that, and possibly in these it will not return that pain, even though it is made small.</end_of_turn>
And it may well be said that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and is a miraculous thing, not as those understand it who do not know it, for they believe that it is not a cure that uses medicine or any other cause except for cautery itself.</end_of_turn
But the cause is contrary to this; and the understanding that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is true only when the methods of healing in certain diseases are administered, and those medicines do not confer, and at the end of the cause it is necessary to administer cautery, and benefit from that.</end_of_turn And so it is that in these days it is said that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding which the vulgar people and the fools of the doctors have.
And I say to you the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and I do not say this except for the equality of gold and the fineness of its substance.</end_of_turn
And I say that the place of cautery does not make it harsh, as some people say, for indeed I have already seen that this does not make any difference except in certain bodies where the other methods are less effective; and cautery with gold is better than with iron, just as some people say; but indeed when you make cautery with fire from gold, it is not your business to declare that, for it is ignited according to the quantity you wish for the roughness of the gold, and you must prepare to receive the cold; and if you do not adjust for this, the gold will be consumed by the fire, and in the fire some scales will remain so that the artist will cut for the occupation of that.</end_of_turn
And for this reason it is useful to make cautery with iron, you must put it more lightly and more cautiously to the right of the operation.</end_of_turn
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those chapters which are between the feet to be omitted, so that I relieve those who ask me what they want from me.</end_of_turn
Chapter one.</end_of_turn>
This cautery confers relief from the accidental causes of which it is a cause of soda and multiple fluxes of humors raumatic, applied to the head and the limbs and the joints, multiple sleep and toothache, and the like of all diseases which come from cold, even as paralysis, tetanus, apoplexy, and the like.</end_of_turn
The method of this cautery is as follows: first command the patient to evacuate with medical laxatives for three or four nights, according to the excess of the virtue of the disease and the age of the patient and his custom.</end_of_turn
And then command him to shave his head with a razor, and make him sit between your legs on a fallen bench and place your hand over his head.
And put your thumb against the root of your nose between your nostrils. Indeed, as the doctor has said, when the liquid of the limb is inflamed, it is a sign of that limb. And make a burn with an olive twig of this shape:
And put it over the affected area until it descends, in such a way that your hand is slightly constricted, and pull that out slowly.
Then take your hand away slightly and hold the limb, and if you see already some quantity of bone exposed, as much as the quantity of barley grains, then lift your hand, and if you do not withdraw your hand from that side, do so from the other, if it is cold, until it is seen that the bone is no longer visible as I have said to you
And take a little salt and dissolve it on the limb and keep it there for three days.
And put over the wound a bandage in border and keep it there until the burn of the fire is destroyed And take care of the limb with ointment until it is healed
And indeed, when the plague remains open, it is better to take honey from the branch, for it is better and more helpful.
I say to you all that the bone must be cauterized until it reaches the bone, and keep the cautery there until every part of the substance of the bone has been consumed
And so be it that which remains of the bone is soft, and so be it cured.</start_of_turn>
And I say to you all that it must be cauterized until it reaches the heel, for in this way it will be more likely that the bone will be strong within it, and this is the way of allaying it slightly: And it is estimated from that limb that the vapors of the head expire from it.
And if the plague remains open for a long time, and so be it cured when it is solidified
I do not see these two methods of cautery in any other home, except for fear; and leave that to me, for it is better for me that you are well, rather than that you risk your life for nothing. For the head of the patient is usually developed by the continuity of the limbs, as we have testified in other members, and more so when the head of the patient is of soft nature.
The first method of cautery is better and more useful, for you; and from that I have seen in this work that it is better for me.</start_of_turn>

The end of the text is not included in the provided passage.
When in all the head there is chronic and long-lasting pain, and when it is prolonged in the disease, and when it is used with poultices and cushions and capsulars and plasters and mustard and garlic and herbs and vinegar and alum, and especially if the bone has already been cauterized with one cautery without any of those causes having profited it, then consider that if the head of the disease is of strong formation in its nature; and it is not soft and finds no great heat, then cauterize with another cautery leaving a little space. And cauterize over the heel of the foot with the cautery until the bone is fractured. Incise the bone and uncover from the bone the quantity that we have recounted and cauterize that which is in the lower part of the head in the place where it is applied to the vein, — and that is the place where the swelling is stopped.</start_of_turn> And hold your hand still in this way, and do not uncover the bone, for the disease finds great pain from that other than from all the other cauteries of the head.</start_of_turn>
I say that this cautery in this place is more subtle than the one which is used for the heel of the foot and the back of the head; and this is the way to do it.</start_of_turn

Of ancient cautery of emigration.
When in the part of the head there is soft pain, or widespread pain throughout the belly, evacuate immediately with medicines that soften the head, and give the other treatment which I have mentioned in the preceding diseases; and if it does not profit, know that the cautery in this case is done in two ways: either with acute medicinal combustion or with a cautery.</start_of_turn
May the cautery burn with the power of medicine, for you take a dose of alum, expel that, and remove the extremities of both hands from above. And thus indicate the area of pain on the temple with a lancet, so that the hair covering the area is shaved away, since it is hidden.
And thus bind over the area with a tight constriction, leave it for three hours; then remove the dressing and apply alum, and leave the wound covered for two or three days, and then rest your hand over the area until the area is healed
And take care of that which is inflamed until it is healed.
And if you wish, faith that many medicines can combat these which I have written in the treatise of medicinal treatments
May the cautery be carried out according to this manner: the fire for the cautery is of this form:
and is called closed nails, which have a head like a nail in which there is a small curvature, and in the middle of the area there is a small elevation
And rest your hand over the area of pain, and hold your hand there — so that the wound is not bruised — and gradually move the fire forward slowly
And if the quantity of that which is bruised by the speculum is as great as the majority, elevate your hand so that the artery is not bruised, so that there is no flow of blood
And soak the wound in salt water and rest it on the area, leave it for three days; then rest the limb immersed in butter, and take care of the wound until it is healed
And if you wish, cauterize at the edge of the nail according to the cautery, and guard against the incision of the artery in this place precisely not-ancient.
Chapter four.</start_of_turn>
Of the cautery of ancient embolism.</start_of_turn>
When you have treated the embolism as we have said in the preceding cure, and as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and do not avail of the cure, and sometimes for the disease which does not suffice to it which we have said of the first cautery with medicine or with fire, then when you have ignited the cautery nail until it is white, because that signifies about the area of pain along the line of length of which is the majority of the finger, or whatever; pause your hand for a while and bind that until you have incised the artery and reached the bone.
However necessary it is that you guard against the continuation of the mandible, which is bad for chewing, and that the nail not be bruised and the nerves which are bad for that, and that no spasm occur
And if it is concerning the custody and care of the flow of blood of the artery that is being cut, because in the cutting of it there is fear, and especially to that which ignores what is done and is not studious and is reckless; leave the operation in peace from the beginning.</start_of_turn>
And I come to remind you of the arrangement of the flow of blood concerning the accidental cutting of the artery according to its custom.</start_of_turn
And if you see this disease that this cautery does not suffice and you see the limbs of the patient tolerable, cauterize that in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have said in the chapter concerning the stretching of the artery with two nails, and this is a better cautery and more comprehensive.
Chapter five.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of the pains of the heel.</start_of_turn
When in the heel there is pain due to cold and is cured by lacative causes and by the other cure which I have said in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then ignite the cautery, and this is the one which has no point, of which this is the form:
And approach the point near the ignition, and bring the flame around the entire heel as if it were being revolved, or around the circumference of any abscess if the pain is in any place.</start_of_turn Along with you the cautery from the root of the heel little by little until you have seen that it has branded the area with a mark.</start_of_turn
If the cautery has pricked twelve points throughout the heel, and which are those, then promptly treat the area until it is healed.
If the cautery has pricked twelve points throughout the heel, and which are those, then promptly treat the area until it is healed.

When you have cured that area of the heel with lye, capis and balsam, and have confirmed that the pain has gone away, then do not touch the area with the cautery. The doctor must cauterize the area three times: first at the root of the heel, then slightly lower down, and finally at the junction of the two lips.

Therefore, if it is good for the patient; otherwise, it is customary for them to receive three cautery burns on the back part of their head, which extend from the most superior part of the head down to the most inferior part of the neck. And pause between each burn the thickness of a finger, and take care that the burn does not proceed too far.
May be you are addicted, and the patient is tolerant of it; however, it is customary for them to receive a burn on the middle of the foot; and if you wish to make the addiction greater, burn the area over the two nails.</start_of_turn>

And give the patient water throughout the week once a day, with the other regimen of him good until he is healthy; or if you wish, make small points according to the best of him, but keep your hand with a pointed cautery in order.

And hold that limb firmly in the groin or in the groin crease.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
When the doctor has finished speaking concerning the water treatment for the head and the rest that I have mentioned in the division, then begin to administer the medicine and give a drink to the patient, so that it changes their head, and keep them away from all humidity.
And make them sit in a bath for several days.
And command them to keep their heads still, and cauterize that area around the middle of the head; and cauterize two points on two temples if it is the beginning of treatment with two waters, or one on the temple if it is the beginning of treatment with one water.
Return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
And keep the patient away from drafts when it is cauterized; and if you see that there are still drafts, stop any medicine that you are giving them.
And I come to know the knowledge of extracting arteries and about the extraction of them and care for drafts.
And each vein is cauterized at the neck, leaving two bones with two cauteries in between them, as is usually done.

Of the ancient cautery of tears.
When tears from the eyes are ancient and accumulate in the veins and arteries that are in the area of the outside of the head and it is verified that these are superfluous fatty phlegmas, then cauterize that area around the middle of the head that we recounted in the chapter concerning the beginning of water treatment in the two waters, and around the middle of the head and on two temples, and two cauteries in the neck leaving two bones. And if you disagree with the addition, then cauterize that around the root of the hair on the edge of the heel with a small cautery.

And if you like, cauterize over the two eyebrows with a little one at both ends, and they will lengthen from the temples. And the length of each cautery is according to the quantity of the eyebrow
And do not burn your hand with the cautery, but according to the quantity that the third part of the eyelid is scorched

Of the cautery of the eye when its parts are converted into parts of dust and put its hand on the eye.
When the parts of the eye are converted into dust particles and you put your hand on the eye, cauterize in those two ways, that is either by making an incision or by using a burning medicine.
If I cauterize the eye with fire, command the patient to drink until the tears flow again as those that are seen to fall, until they are prolonged and equal; and if I put the hand on them, then strengthen the eyes of the patient with a bandage so that it is not burnt until the tears are born again.
Therefore, when the attendants are born and seasoned, the doctor should place his hand over the patient's navel, and over the pupil of his eyes, as a signal which should be according to the figure of a lily flower, and should begin the signal from the nipples.
And then keep your hand poised over the bladder or in the belly of the fish on the heel.
And bring forth the pointed cautery of which this is the form.
And cauterize on the figure which you have signaled, little by little, with smoky veined matter, until the surface of the bone which appears like a lily flower is completely consumed, which is indeed properly done
And the sign of the completion of the work is that you see the pupil of the eye already contracted and the nipples raised above the puncture of the eye
Therefore raise your hand and lay it there for three days, and keep your hand poised over the bladder until the scar is finished And take care of that until it is healed
May it be that if it returns for any reason, then bring nourishment and soften the pupil, and the doctor will do another cautery over all that has already been done as he did at first
May the pupils remain soft, leaving the heel untouched, that the cautery be made when it is naturally elevated and softened, and that the nipples not be pressed against the eye
May the cautery be made with medical knowledge to command the patient to lie on their side until the nipples are prolonged and softened, and indeed lay a layer of paper in the form of a lily flower over the wound
And take sponges of knowledge and cause living air to go up and down endlessly. namely, Or what you will, and mix these causes well together, and do this with speed so that it does not become angry; and expand from this over the paper which is made like a lily flower, and place that over the eye or both; and place the eye back in the bladder or the pupil of the eye should be in the belly
And take note of the medicine and do that a little and do not delay until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, which is in them just like fire
Therefore when you perceive that the bite of the medicine has ceased, the doctor should read the medicine and do that which has been told to him; when the bite has ceased, the doctor should remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and the doctor should consider whether the pupil is already raised as it is washed away by the constriction from the fire or from the incision, for the doctor knows that this is well; and if it does not return concerning the medicine on the place where it was not placed until the medicine is healed and the operation is complete.
And keep your hand poised over the bladder until the bone of the wound has been eradicated, and take care of that which is deafened or otherwise until it is healed
It is necessary that you, in your operation, must keep watch diligently that the medicine does not fall from the eye, and if the pupil is somewhat days softened by any cause and the patient’s fingers press on the eye, the doctor should repeat the medicine on that place where the pupil is softened, just as he did at the beginning, and indeed in this way rather than in any other way, and keep it until it is healed.
This is the form of the lily flower.
You know that the pupils of men are diverse in size and in number, and therefore according to that is the extent of your contraction.
And do not be ignorant of the way of proceeding in this art.

Of cauterization of the fistula that is in the lacrimal of the eye.</start_of_turn
When you treat the fistula with that which we have said in the divisions of the diseases and you do not confer your cure, the doctor must command the patient to place their head down in the belly, and keep the head of them from any attendant between the thighs in such a way that it is neither maudlin nor agitated in the head
And keep your hand poised over the bladder or in the belly of the fish on the heel of the eye.</start_of_turn>
And bring forth the pointed cautery of which this is the form:</start_of_turn
The pain that is caused by cold humors that penetrate all parts of the body, and which appears in the feet, is commonly called gout by doctors.
And if necessary, let it penetrate through to the other extremity.</end_of_turn> And if you must, let it come out thus as when you attempt it.</end_of_turn
However, that which is concave is better than that which is convex.</end_of_turn>
Then press the fistula if it is opened, and take away the swelling and moisture from it.</end_of_turn And if it is not opened, then open it and extract the purulent matter from it.</end_of_turn
And place your hand over the area that is to be cauterized, and take hold of that little finger of the hand that is next to the nose, so that your hand does not move or that the patient becomes agitated, and when you have placed the cautery over the area, move it.</end_of_turn
Therefore if at the beginning of the cautery it enters the bone, it is not good; otherwise, repeat the cautery once or twice if necessary; and leave that thus for three days, and then place your hand over that part and keep it covered with moisture until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If even after passing a few days it is not healed, then place your hand over the acute corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered and is flattened as is appropriate in the head of the sufferer.</end_of_turn>
Another method of cauterizing a fistula is as follows: enter the area of the fistula and burn that, and then place your hand over that crevice which is the shape of it: and there you will put the quantity of lead that is usually found; and keep your hand firmly in place, so that the lead does not reach the nose of the patient; and that you cover the nose of the patient with a cushion of wool or something similar, so that the lead adheres to the area of the fistula and heals that miraculously.</end_of_turn
And if the fistula is healed with the cautery and the treatment that we have said, it is not good; otherwise, it is necessary to administer medicine through the nose and reduce the fistula to the root of the nose as it is appropriate in its place.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of the fistula.</end_of_turn
Many veins appear in the lips, and more especially in the lips of children.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you cure those fissures with the things that we have said in the divisions and you do not avail yourself of your treatment, then it is necessary to cauterize the small cutlet in this way:
And let the curvature be according to the thickness of the skin.</end_of_turn
Then place your hand firmly over that area until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissure.</end_of_turn
And take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of the fistula in the mouth.</end_of_turn
When in the root of the uvula or on the palate or on the roots of the teeth there is an accumulation of pus and the surrounding area is swollen, and the swelling is broken, and the pus is evacuated, and there is a fistula formed, and if you do not avail yourself of the treatment, it is necessary to cauterize according to the quantity that is received in the fistula, and put that cautery into the hole of the fistula, and keep your hand over that until the fire of the cautery reaches the bottom of it, and after that make a slight incision or two; and take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Therefore if the swelling is abscessed and is healed, it is not good; otherwise, it is necessary to uncover the location and remove the corrupted bone as is appropriate in its place.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of the teeth and the mollification of the veins.</end_of_turn
When the veins are softened by humidity and the teeth are blackened, and you treat them with medicines and do not find relief, then place the hand of the patient over the head of the patient and let the tip of the cautery be in the form that you will see fit, and when you have placed it, immediately bring the cautery to the area and keep your hand over the area until the pain is relieved.
And now draw your hand away and repeat the cautery several times as you wish.
And now draw your hand away and repeat the cautery several times as you wish.
Chapter XXI.
Of cautery for toothache
When toothache is caused by cold, or if it is cold or hot, or if you do not agree with the treatment with medicine, then do the cautery in two ways: either with a burn at the edge of the tooth, or with a burn at the root of the tooth
The burn at the edge of the tooth is that you take the edge of a cow's hoof and put it into the hole of iron, and then take hold of the toe and cover the extremity with it, and then immerse that burn in oil, and stop that on the painful tooth immediately until it is cooled down
And repeat that several times until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the teeth.
And if you wish, immerse a sponge or a cloth in the burn of the said thing, and place that on the painful tooth, and place over that the iron ignited until the iron reaches the bottom of the cavity of the tooth
More importantly, you must take care of the color of the charcoal or of the iron, and that in the middle of it there should be no blackness, and the heat of the fire should not reach the mouth of the patient.
And now draw your hand away and repeat the cautery several times as you wish. The heat of the burn should be such that it will cause the pain to disappear, and place your hand over the tooth until the burn is cooled; and do several times so that the pain will disappear or on this day or on the next day
And know that after this cautery the patient should fill his mouth with good broth and keep it for an hour and then remove it; this is the way of the cautery.
And cauterize as much as you wish of the extremity as you are able to do
And this is the way of the cannula:
Chapter XXII
Of cautery for wisdom teeth
When wisdom teeth are of flesh and cold humors and do not obey digestion with medicines and you wish to digest them lightly, then you must ignite the burn two fingers apart so that the smoke does not burn you, and place that ignited burn on that abscess once for a while, and another if you digest it, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess
And if the abscess is small, then pause the burn according to the quantity of the abscess, and hold it covered with a cloth for three days and put over that a sponge soaked in oil until that which the fire has consumed is remauged
And take care of that with oil and lint and bandages until it is healed
Chapter XXIII
Of cautery for hoarseness of voice and constriction of the throat
When the humors are over the windpipe, and especially when they are cold of composition, then know that you must evacuate the patient with laxative medicines at the beginning, and then cauterize that which is under the root of the epiglottis in the groove that is below the root
And take care that you do not reach the epiglottis with the burn or that you do not burn the cord of the voice but only a little bit
And cauterize that which is between the joint of the chin and the last rib of the neck And the burn of the neck must be like that described above.
And take care of that until it is healed
Chapter XXIV
Of cautery for chest pain and cough
When cough and chest pain are of cold humors and the patient has no fever or chills and is an old illness, then you must cauterize that two times on the furcula in the grooves that are below the teeth and bones; and at another time in the middle of the foot between two nipples; and make the burn like that described above
If you wish, make the puncture with the pointed cautery as is customary for the puncture of painful swellings.
If you wish, make the puncture with the pointed cautery as is customary for the puncture of painful swellings; and take care that there is no more tissue than is necessary between the cautery and the underlying tissue, which is precedent to its being healthy.</end_of_turn>

Of cautery of the titillic which is the head of the helper.</end_of_turn
When the head of the helper is displaced by the action of slippery humors and is not fixed at the hour of reaping, you must reduce the displacement as soon as possible. And if it has happened as we have been told, that the joint has been displaced to such an extent that it cannot return to its place without force, then elevate the thigh which is on the side of the thumb of your left hand if the joint has been displaced to the inside.
And take care that the cautery does not have two heads; and this is the fashion of them:
And make the cautery of the thigh until it penetrates the other side; and the figure of the cautery will come when there are four cauteries.</end_of_turn
And every vegetable is adjusted according to this count and because there are eight cauteries.</end_of_turn
And take care to place over the cautery some salt-soaked sponges, and make the patient relax, and that the limb be not painful for any length of time until it has been comforted.</end_of_turn
And if the displacement is to the outside and it is necessary, make the cautery over the muscle at the base of the thumb or over several cauteries with the pointed tip, so that the joint is confirmed and the humor is evacuated and the patient is healed.</end_of_turn>
(The text ends abruptly, indicating the end of the treatise.)</end_of_turn
Of cautery of the stomach.</end_of_turn
When there is cold and moist humors in the stomach which cause swelling and multiply the worms therein, and if you continue your methods of care without confirming, then it is necessary that the patient be placed with their face downwards, and that you extend their legs and thighs, and make three cauteries: one cautery on the tip of the thumb and two cauteries on the two sides of the cautery, until the triangular figure of the cautery appears; and lengthen between those which are not adjusted so that they will make a wound.</end_of_turn
And if the depth of the cautery is equal to two-thirds of the breadth of the thigh.</end_of_turn
And the figure of the cautery is like this, etc. And if you wish, make a large cautery in the middle of the stomach like this; and this is a cautery in the form of a circle like this.</end_of_turn
And cauterize the stomach with the pointed tip of that cautery which is causing pain: and that you mark on the stomach the place where you wish to make the cautery, and then make the cautery in that place; and take care of the aftercare which precedes until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of cautery of the heel bone.</end_of_turn
When there is pain in the heel due to coldness or moisture or excessive wind, and the normal swelling of the limb has been expelled by excessive discharge, and if you do not confirm it, then it is necessary that the patient be placed with their face upwards, and mark on the limb three cauteries like this and in this quantity above the heel beyond the hip bones, holding the heel of the limb still.</end_of_turn
And the space between each two cauteries is according to the thickness of the finger, and the cauteries are like the length of the limb.</end_of_turn
Do not make the cautery too tight.</end_of_turn
And if the quantity of liquid which is poured out is equal to the quantity of the bulk of the limb, and it is not more adjusted; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then keep them still, the one who has extended their thighs, and elevate the hips.</end_of_turn
And you must know that this cautery can be performed with a pointed cautery, when you are prudent and skilled in the art.
And take care that you do not proceed too much with the cautery, and that you be attentive to the entirety of the limb so that all parts are cauterized and reach the bones, for the limb is subtle here; know this well.</end_of_turn>

Of the perforation of the abscess of the foot with cautery.</end_of_turn
When swelling or abscess occurs in the foot and you wish to know whether that abscess is in the flesh of the foot or in the membrane of the limb, if it is in the flesh of the foot, the patient experiences great pain and the pain is acute.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the membrane of the foot, the pain is acute and often the doctors are already exhausted in caring for it.</end_of_turn
Therefore the patient must be placed above the navel; and then draw out the abscess with a hook; and then burn the cautery with the rag it is bound with, as it is described in the next page.</end_of_turn And burn until all the limb is cauterized, until it reaches the bone, until it is well healed.</end_of_turn
And take care of the care of the other abscesses until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And do not attempt this method of cautery unless you have studied it in the art of medicine and are familiar with many others; for many bad diseases are known from this operation; however, experience has shown that this should not be done without having learned the proper method, which is best.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXIX.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of pleurisies.</end_of_turn
I say that the ancient cauteries of the roots of Aristotle on pleurisies are done in this manner: take from the roots of Aristotle a long thorn about the size of a finger, which is found, and burn it.</end_of_turn
And immerse that in oil and vinegar and put it in the fire, and burn with two small cauteries guiding, one slightly declining from the part that is below the beard, and two from the rib that is declining from the fifth rib to the twelfth, declining slightly from the back; and another at the middle of the foot; and another over the stomach, and three at the back; and one at the place between the two hips, and two on the two sides of the foot, leaving the cautery that is between two hips.</end_of_turn
And do not grasp your hand with the cautery, but keep it visible in the work.</end_of_turn
And as I have said concerning the ancient people, they are like those of the men who use a cautery that is like a ray of iron and fire, and put that in the place between the ribs, until that abscess is expelled and is healed, just as we have said concerning the abscess of the foot.</end_of_turn
However, in this perforation with cautery, there is no fear, for many times this has happened in the fistula where it does not heal.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of the ulcer.</end_of_turn
When you are treating the disease of the ulcer with what we have said concerning the care of the division, and you do not confer your care, then the burn the ulcer in three ways, which are all safe, as follows: that you make three or four lines according to the length of the ulcer according to the figure of the cauteries of the foot, the figure of which has preceded.</end_of_turn
And between each cautery let the size be that of a finger or a little more, and the manner of performing the cautery is the same as that which we have said concerning the cautery of the foot.</end_of_turn
Do not grasp your hand with the cautery; and the patient must lie above the waist.</end_of_turn
And another manner of cauterizing is that you ignite the cautery having two assistants, as we have said in the chapter of dislocation of the muscle, and lift the limb which is at the end of the ulcer towards the chest so that it does not touch the side of the ulcer.</end_of_turn
The elevation should be at the height of the knee according to the length of the body, so that the cautery can be performed according to the breadth of the limb.
And now insert two lancets, ignite the flame, in that part where the knee approaches the other limb
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus there will be four cauteries in total
And if you wish, cauterize at the head of the cautery without three lancets.
Then keep the cautery covered until it has ceased bleeding for several days, which is different from the other previous causes of the cure

On cautery of hydropic swelling.
Cautery does not take effect in hydropic swelling but in albumin properly
When you cure the hydropic swelling in the manner of the treatments that we have said in the division and do not confer the treatment, then cover that four cauteries are made on the circumference of the belly and one on the stomach, and one on the heel, and two between the vertebrae of the two, and one at the root of the foot, and one on the stomach. And the quantity of the depth of the cautery should be appropriate to the breadth of the knee
And then keep the cautery covered so that it does not bleed for a long time
Do not evacuate the patient from treatment immediately after the cautery because it is added to two understandings, and let it be fasting with the assistance of healing.
The way in which the belly is cauterized is like a claw according to the form of that which is previous, and it is that in which the two olives are cauterized as is previous to its form

When the feet are swollen with hydrosis and are filled with salty water, cover that you cauterize the feet over the two toes without burning the skin; and elevate your hand over the cautery and do not touch it; and elevate your hand and do not take it away, because the salty water remains
This is the cautery in this way: And make two punctures on the two parts of the foot, and in any part where it is necessary to make a puncture at the end of the cautery And let the cautery be according to the length of the part: leave the nail of the big toe and the other under the middle of the part; and over each part make two punctures
Leave the wound open for a long time so that any remaining water drains from it

On cautery of the belly
When the belly is hot and humid so that it must evacuate the verdigris, which is the digestive and retaining virtue, which is in the stomach and the intestines, and this is cured by the methods of treatment and is not necessary, and sometimes the patient suffers from cauteries of virtue showing, then cauterize that which is a great cautery over the great stomach as it precedes in the cautery of the stomach, at the circle and four cauteries in the circumference of the belly button, at the claw-shaped cautery; and a cautery over the navel over aloes large, or two punctures.
And if sometimes the humid substances are expelled and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize that over the pubic bone and over the intestines, and firmly adjust two punctures over the stomach and below the flanks, which is a perfect cure for the benefit of which you will not err

On cautery of ancient hemorrhoids
When they are in the nature behind ancient hemorrhoids or one of thick cold humors or corrupted humidity, and are cured by what we have said in the division and do not confer the treatment, then cauterize with three cauteries over the base of the two small and small triangular vertebrae, and remove the navel cord with two cuts
If you suspect that the patient's stomach is inflamed, the food is not digested, and their face is sometimes pale, then cauterize the area around the stomach with a large cautery, as well as on the flanks and over the hipbone. Keep the cautery on for some time until the patient is healed.
When joints are affected by cold humors that spread throughout the body, and pain specifically affects the feet, doctors commonly call this gout.
Continue the treatment by performing a cautery around the abscess.
When you drain the abscess, then cauterize the area with a sponge-like cautery. Place the burning cautery into the abscess and leave your hand over the area until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the pus has drained.
And if there are two veins or more that appear to be swollen, then cauterize each one as we have described previously, and take care of those which are causing the pain until the patient is healed
If you cauterize with a large cautery over anything, it is better to delay the treatment

When fistulas are caused by natural factors, they are detrimental in their nature in their parts
When nature does not obey the work that we have recommended in their place, and the patient is terrified, whether they are healed or cauterized
Therefore, when there is a fistula in nature that is old, corrupt with pus and dampness, and it is more worthy that you try to close it than to leave it open.
Like a sponge-like cautery And place the burning cautery into the fistula according to the thickness of the tissue
Repeat the cautery until the corrupted parts become blackened, for a period of two or three times, according to the amount of tissue to be removed
Be careful not to burn nerves or blood vessels; if the fistula is in the bladder or the abdomen, take great care of all surrounding areas; do not proceed until the fistula is in fatty tissue and you think it is not penetrating
Take care of the area until it is healed
If the wound is sealed and the pus has been drained from it, and it remains covered for a long time, then know that it is already completely healed
If the matter has not been removed from it, then know that it is penetrating or in the premon of its corruption, or because of these causes it will remind you in the wound

Treatment of the kidney
When there is an excess of cold and humid air, and it is forbidden to bathe, the monthly discharges become corrupted, their provocation is delayed, and they cause pain.

When there is an excess of cold and humid air, and the mucus is spread throughout the limb, it is the cause of swelling of the foot, and a sign that the swelling is prolonged when compared with the other side. And the joint of the dislocation is found in the area where the pain is located
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the patient over the limb of the foot with a circular burn, because you have seen that it is useful in the circle when it is reversed, so that the part falls from the circumference of the circle.
And the cautery that precedes this form is that of the stomach
And if this cautery is not at your disposal, then cauterize with three cauteries with olive oil.
And the burn should be made according to the amount of spiciness of the whole body; and take care that it is not painful

Of cautery of the sciatic vein.
When there is pain in the area of the ankle, and it is caused by cold and humidity, the disease is cured with what we have said and do not confer, and what is antiquated, the hour is that you remove the pain from the humors of the blood with solid or artificial pills or something similar; and then cauterize it
And the manner of performing the cautery is in two ways: either with medicinal remedies or with fire.
According to two scientific methods, the one is that which cauterizes that over the area of the ankle with three triangular cauteries according to this shape; and do it with good depth And the space between each two cauteries is the quantity of the thickness of the finger and if the cautery is with olive oil or great
Many people see the burn on the inside of the ankle over the head of the ankle because there are four cauteries
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle that precedes the form of the dislocation of the ankle, and that is a continuous circle and consumes the spiciness of the whole body
This is the manner of cautery of the sciatica when the pain is adherent to the ankle and does not extend to the swelling
And if it extends to the swelling, the hour is that you cauterize with two cauteries on the swelling over the area where you feel the pain; and one cauterization over the heel for four fingers just below the cervical part
And if the burn blisters, and the depth of the burn is according to the quantity of the spiciness of the body
And if the pain extends to the area below the toes, the hour is that you cauterize here where you feel the pain with a burn of three points or four or more if you think of it.
And if the pain appears to be leaving the swelling, the hour is that you cauterize here with a blistering burn
Keep yourself in every cautery that you do not reach the nerves or great vessels, and that for which reason you will not do any harm or contraction to the patient
And I have already seen others who have cauterized over the heel and finally at the end of the cautery, the limb became swollen until the tumor achieved the foot, and the limb was perforated and corrupted all the way through And take a strong solution of vinegar, and take care of death
If the pain is in two parts together, cauterize each one according to this manner.
Say the learned ones, each cautery should be shaped like a circle of iron whose circumference is equal to the width of a palm; and let the depth of the orifice be as great as that of a date seed or a little more
And if the circle is a third of an inch wide; and let the space between them be equal to the thickness of a bean; and if these circles are made in two parts, let the length of these marks be a nail or two nails, and make them on the margins of the iron that is properly placed in the circles; and this is their form
Then ignite the fire within so that it smokes and gives sparks, and hold your hand over the part of the limb, the patient lying on their side. And thus cauterize three cauteries round about in a row
And thus leave that for three days; then cover that with a bandage and leave the wound open for several days; and care for that until it is healed
Say Albucasis: or, friends, of this kind of cautery we have used little for the terror of its regard, and for what few have found that which regard over it.
More of these cauteries should be made to it than those that suffer from it, and find at that place of them.
More cauteries are better than medicines that remain; for you make two circles having a hole pierced in the middle through which the pain of the nails escapes; let the length of the nail be two nails or as many as those
And if the space between them is equal to the thickness of a nail; and if they are made from above and below, and that they contain each other according to this form:
And hold your hand over the part of the limb the patient is resting on their side, and compress your hand over the part of the limb; and take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and the quantity of that should be as much as a small fire, and keep that for the quantity of an hour, and suffer the patient the biting and the throbbing of the limb – for that other biting is like fire – until the biting ceases.
And then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe off the warm water from the entire limb with cold water.
And leave that for three days and pause over that border until the blackness of the throbbing is gone, and leave it for several days, and come away from it when it has recovered; this is the best remedy
And care for that until it is healed
And if the pain extends to the thigh or the chest, make them drink water as much as is fitting for the ankle swelling.
This is the way of warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines Recipe of alkali and caustic not extinguished of both parts, take one part each, and grind them and pause in a new liquid from which the left-hand side is pierced with a small hole according to the quantity that enters into it
Pause for a while the liquid of the other liquid and get over that alkali and caustic alive from warm water which takes those for a thumb, and when you have compressed those with your thumb for good compression, and leave the whole of what comes from the acute water in the left hand to the other liquid
And adjust all that water, and get the other caustic alive and another alkali renewed, for that the hour if it has strength will be administered in surgical operations of medicine and in cauterization of the other limbs, for that operation is like fire.
And of some medicines which are cauterized widely, some are like vinegar and salt and caustic with broth which must be mixed together
And behold the account of a man of the ancients who relates the operation and care with which he cured ankle and sciatica pain, and magnifies more than enough to be of that, and says that no other care is necessary, and that he is healed in a week just as recommended, for that is strong indeed that this remedy is in broth and indeed it has already succeeded in that
And that it be taken in the morning of certain herbs green, and if it is not found green, it may be taken with fresh figs; and take it ground with a little barley and put it on the ankle where the pain is, or in the thigh or chest, and bind it
The treatment should last for three hours or for as long as the patient can tolerate the procedure.
Then put him in water and when the body is swollen, bring him into the sun, for the pain will cease and he will be healed.</end_of_turn>
Remember that one should never use these cauteries except for the evacuation of the body.</end_of_turn
Now indeed I say that when the vein becomes swollen with a wound of a goat, it is cauterized; do this immediately without delay. And let the cautery be done in this manner: take wool and soak it in oil against inflammation, and place it between the toes and the heel.</end_of_turn>
And do the same with a dry wound of a goat, and bring the cautery into the flesh as far as necessary; and place the wool over the cautery and hold down the flesh until it has healed.</end_of_turn And do the same again with water, and do not cease until the sensation of the bite has passed through the ankle and the pain has ceased.</end_of_turn
And this method of cautery is called cautery of the cow.</end_of_turn>

Of the cautery of two pains.</end_of_turn
Some pains in the two limbs are caused by two factors, such as in the case of wounds or percussion or excessive evacuation, and for such causes, for infusion of fatty and humid matter.</end_of_turn
The cautery does not take effect except in this only kind which is useful for the effusion of fatty matter.</end_of_turn
Therefore, in order to evacuate the patient from the two limbs in which the pain is present, give pills that are fitting and similar to them, and let them be useful over the two in which the pain is three lines according to their width, because otherwise if you try to burn them in any line or cauterize them, it may cause more harm than good, according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance and the power of the medicine.</end_of_turn
And the cautery is useful with the pointed cautery.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries or with four medial cauteries according to this manner:
Chapter 53.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery at the beginning of swelling.</end_of_turn
These girls are often afflicted with this disease in their small age; and a sign of the beginning of the disease in children is that it happens on their nails and is accompanied by elevation and movement.</end_of_turn
And you will find in the back the spine of the two and of the nails that it already begins to overcome the other vertebrae.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you see that and you want to prohibit it, when the time comes, cauterize that which is circular according to this manner:</start_of_turn> that it surrounds the cautery over the whole part of the vertebra equally.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with the pointed cautery two or three lines.</start_of_turn And let the points be close to each other.</start_of_turn
And take care of the area until it is healed with the water that we have mentioned.</start_of_turn
Note that the cautery should not be administered in swelling that is caused by spasm of nerves.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of gout and joint pain.</end_of_turn
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn
And therefore when gout is cured by means of treatment and the pains are not left, the time comes to cauterize.</start_of_turn
And that you cauterize around the evacuation in the circuit of the ankle with multiple cauteries.</start_of_turn
And let the cautery be of olive oil of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</start_of_turn If pain spreads throughout the joints or to other parts, and the cause of the pain is known, then cauterize the painful area with three or four cautery needles in this manner.
If more needles are needed for the cauterization, do not keep your hand too close to the cautery tip, but rather keep your hand slightly away from the area being treated.
If pain spreads to the heel and the toes, then administer the cautery as mentioned earlier in this book
If the pain is only on the sole of the foot and is severe, then puncture the area around the bones as if making a wheel, and puncture in those two lines.
If the pain persists, then puncture around the bones on each side and on the side of the hand
If the pain comes close to nerves or muscles, then cauterize all the surrounding areas of the assistants.
Do not evacuate the patient without proper treatment and the administration of medicines, for if treatment is good and the inflammation subsides, it will be evacuated with this needle alone, God willing.

On cauterization of fractures.</end_of_turn>
When a fracture occurs in the ankle and the bones are displaced by the atela of the tibia, and when this begins to happen, then command the patient to lie still in the bed and use soft cushions to prevent the wound from opening from the belly
And then follow the patient between your hands on the bed, and command them to keep their foot away from the wound until the atela or bone is extracted.
And then return that which was taken from the thighs and hold the fracture on the bone of the ankle with a signal that resembles the middle third of the circumference of the limb
And then ignite the cautery in this way:
Until it is not red and has a cinnamon color Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And then hold the cautery over that signal with your hand over the cautery, and do so until you have brought the bone of the ankle into the middle of the wound; and repeat this for the other side if you have not managed to do so in the first attempt with the bone.</end_of_turn>
Observe carefully the condition of the intestine during the cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine and cause death or another great harm to the patient.</end_of_turn>
And remember that when you have finished cauterizing, do not neglect the bone, do not confer your operation.</end_of_turn
And cover the burn of the children with a subtle touch according to their age and measure.</end_of_turn
And take care of the wound of the cautery for three days with an edge within which the wound of the fire is left to rest.</end_of_turn
And take care of the rest in the same way until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And the patient should remain lying still on the bed for forty days until the wound is sealed and the swelling has gone down.</end_of_turn
And cover that you suspend the nourishment of the patient according to the length of time of the treatment which makes the patient lose the strength of his belly, and that the intestine does not come out due to the effort to recover.</end_of_turn
And when it is time to take away the forty days, then administer decent food properly, and keep this up for another forty days.</end_of_turn
And be mindful of work, food, drink, and a gentle voice, for when you use this regimen of treatment entirely, the patient will recover completely.</end_of_turn
And I say that the treatment of fractures in other parts of the belly, and so at the beginning, and you will not make them bleed, the doctor should cauterize the fracture of that which is round according to the quantity of it, and that which is extruded from the heel as much as the third part of it; and take care of that which has been said, and do not be negligent.</end_of_turn
E already said that the first part to be cauterized is the triangle with a triangular cautery according to this manner, because it is a sign with tension.
And it is kept parallel that it is for the breadth at the sides beyond the rupture, and another line below; and stop your hand with a claw cautery, but the first cautery is more acute and better.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn>
Of the cautery of the ankle.</end_of_turn>
When swelling occurs in various members either by injury or percussion and pain persists for a long time without relief from medications, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.</end_of_turn
And the cautery of every member according to the size and the extent of them, and their virtue and development, and the location of the ankle and the pain of them.</end_of_turn
Therefore if the first cautery is not successful, do not hesitate to repeat it; for it is often the case that those pains are caused by a puncture of a vein close to that member, so that you must consider that the pain will cease when the wound is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of leprosy.</end_of_turn
The books tell of many things cauterized with a great effort, and management if the species of leprosy which is harmful for the putrefaction of fat and melancholy.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you want to cauterize that, consider if the leprosy is widespread and whether that which has been cured by what we have said in the division and not of itself, and fear the harm that the corruption encompasses the whole body and the totality of the limbs, then cauterize that on the head with five cautery instruments: one in the middle of the head, and two following leaving them, and the front towards the end of the hair; and two over two nails; and one behind, on the nape or the servant.</end_of_turn
And finally place your hand over the cautery a little distance from where it burns a small empressment, and when the scales are loosened the great vapor escapes from them; cauterize over the heel as needed.</end_of_turn
And if the leprosy has already spread over the body and appears evident, then it is necessary to cauterize that with those cautery instruments which we have said in the head; and with a cautery on the end of the nose, and two cautery instruments on the two upper teeth, and two cautery instruments on two vertebrae of the tailbone, and six cautery instruments on the vertebrae of the buttocks, and one great one on the vertebrae close to the hip, one on the hip, and two on the ankles, and two on the muscles, and two the little toes; and cauterize that on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on all the bones of the feet, and on the sockets of the teeth.</end_of_turn
And take care of the nerves which are above the ankle that you do not burn those.</end_of_turn>
And many things are cauterized with a cautery on the fifth toe bone and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the heel.</end_of_turn
And you know that the more cautery instruments you adjust, the greater the benefit and the greater the comfort; and you know that the body does not suffer from the pain in the cautery, just as if it had not been done, because the body is already stupefaited.</end_of_turn
And it is necessary that the cautery instruments be large or small according to the limbs and the joints according to what is preceded by the species of the instruments.</end_of_turn
And take care of the cautery with flour of barley with honey and with another care that it is healthy.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of stupor.</end_of_turn
When any limb is stiff or asleep and is cured with medicines, oils and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that stiff limb with a cautery instrument according to the greatness of the limb or the smallness of it.</end_of_turn
And the cautery is made penetrating the hardness of the heel a little.</end_of_turn And take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And some veins are cauterized, any swelling which is caused by the mas and the feet, and the spondils of the two, and you will see the swelling of the nerves which arise from that limb, and the swelling is cured.
May not presume about anything except that which is learned in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves throughout the body moving.

May not if you wish to make a perforation of the mass except that you ignite the cautery of which this is the form: and remove that from the middle of the tumor until it reaches the marrow.</end_of_turn

A carbuncle is a wandering corruption in the limb, which consumes that which as if fire were eating dry wood.</end_of_turn
Therefore if sometimes that carbuncle is in the place where you suffer from cautery with fire, then you ignite the cautery of nails a few at a time, as it is convenient in the place where it is corrupt.</end_of_turn
And hold the cautery throughout until you have eradicated all the corruption and there remains no cause of it.</end_of_turn
And keep it quiet for three days, and rest over the cauterized places so that they are sprinkled with oil mixed with vinegar until the scars are all eradicated and all the corruption is gone.</end_of_turn
And take care that no ointment is applied to the wound.</end_of_turn
May not three times a day that the carbuncle appears healed in the place where there is no corruption; for this is not good; but if not, then you repeat the cautery over what remains of the corrupted places.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of ulcers and other similar lesions.</end_of_turn
The joints ache with cold humors that spread through every limb, and when pain arises in the feet, physicians customarily call this gout.
The burning cautery is ignited with charcoal similar to punishment for a whirlwind, which is made of iron according to the quantity that contains the gout of the whole limb, and of subtle stripes.
Then rest the ignited cautery on the gout, and turn your hand over the cautery around the limb until the cautery reaches the depth of the gout And let it rest for three days until the redness subsides And then apply a paste of powdered alum and salt over the wound, and let the paste rest on the wound for one night, so that the inflammation will be eradicated from its root.
And take care of the wound with nourishment from generative ointment until it heals
If it does not improve, and the swelling has occurred on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, when you must administer in those incisions with cold water, take a little of vinegar or iron or punishment for whirlwind, and apply it to the gout; and pour a little cold water over the vinegar, keep your hand over it, and turn it around with your hand, and press the edge of the tube into the cavity of the gout, and withdraw the cold water slowly through the opening of the cavity; and wait for the patient an hour for the effect of the cold water to subside. Then remove it, because the gout has been eradicated from its root.
And so be it with these things and do the same with the rest of them until they are all gone from the body.
And take care of those things that remain, so that the roots of the gout have been eradicated by the nourishment that comes from the food that has been eaten

On cautery for accidental burns of the body
When there are spilled fats in the body, and there are pus-filled wounds that are caused by corrupted thick matter; therefore, at the beginning when it appears, it must be cauterized over the whole head of the fistula with a fine needle and a loop of silk, the limb that is extended over the fire; or at the root of erotology longus; or with a cautery needle.
And sometimes it is necessary to cauterize against the beginning of its discharge according to this manner; and do not be afraid, for it dissolves the swelling and heals from these things
But it must be known that it is useful to evacuate with a tube of flebotomy.

On cautery for the flux of blood from an accidental wound by incision of the artery
There are many veins that arise from the plague that must be closed off, or from the incision of apostemas or cauterization of the limb, and when this happens, it is difficult to stop it
Therefore, when such a thing happens, quickly put your hand over the wound at the orifice of the artery, and pause until the bleeding from the vessel has stopped, and that it does not continue
And then pause for a moment the olive cauteries a few and many, by number many, and let them burn over those until they are not ignited
And then take from those a little or a lot according to the wound and the plague in which the artery is broken, over that vein closing it firmly so that it does not continue bleeding, and hold it cauterized until it is healed and that bleeding has ceased
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you release the tieu dit, take another cautery immediately around the cauteries that are in the fire, and do not cease until the blood is finally stopped
Be careful not to burn the nerves here, and do not aggravate the patient's condition.
When an artery flows freely, it is not possible to restrict it, especially when the artery is large. In such a case, there are four methods: either cauterize as described above, or extract the stone when it is not extracted, for when it is extracted the limbs become burned and the circulation is restricted, or bind tightly with thread or string to strengthen the structure, or apply appropriate medications that can restrict the flow.
May the one who provides restrictions from below bind tightly with thread or string and strengthen the area with a drape or by positioning the body in such a way as to prevent burning, for pain is not to be endured.
Or if it should happen that the physician is not present or has no medicine, know that the opening of the vein must be done immediately as we have said, and understand that the restriction must be great enough to bring the pulse down to the level of the greater part of the plague, and over the cord do not permit any moisture; and over the cord sprinkle with cold water until the pulse has become calm and engorged; and take care that there should be cautery or medicine necessary
On incision and perforation and winds and phlegm and tumors and their appearances.
We have already said in the first chapter that in all diseases in which cautery is convenient and medicine is helpful, and the occasions and causes of these, and the instruments necessary for them, in the forms of cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters of the sovereign part of the head to the feet
And I proceed in this chapter in that way, so that what is desired may be alleviated, regarding what has been demanded of me
And behold, since I am about to speak, fear not, for in the first chapter of cautery it is for terror that I speak.
And for this reason I say that great caution must be taken, for in this operation where there is to be evacuation of the contents of the vein, or incision over the swelling or perforation or extraction of a tumor or purulent discharge or removal of a clot or incision of a stone or other similar things. All these things are accompanied by fear and tremor and in most of them death.
I admonish you that you do not fall into that which is the state of things, for in many cases such veguadas have been the cause of the death of many people. Therefore some of them will be cured of their disease and some will die from it, and some will suffer from their disease for a long time, and some will die from fear of their disease
And of these things I say to you, hope and say that your health is good, and your disease is treacherous.
Therefore do not consent to anything that is proposed to you in this manner; and your caution must be greater than your desire; and do not presume any cause except for that which you have certain knowledge and which is beneficial to you, and to which you must have success in order to be saved
Use in the care of all these maladies the pronouncements and indications that are useful for your health, for in this lies your help in the acquisition of fame and memory, of love and glory
Oh, children, God has placed in you his understanding and I do not wish to give you direction or protection, for that which is in his hand
And I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by chapters according to the order of the chapters of cautery, from the head to the feet, so that what you desire may be alleviated of what you demand of it and what you have need of
First Chapter
Of the care of the water which is contained in the head of children.
You know that this disease often happens in children and when the new-born touches the head of the child, his life is threatened
And many times the cause of this is a hidden one which is not known
I do not see this disease except in children; and in all those whom I have seen it, death has been imminent, and for this reason I have left this work undone in them
And I saw that a child had a head filled with water, and the head of the child was always so swollen that Caesar could not place his hand upon it due to its greatness, and more than that the moisture in it increased until death.
And such moisture is added between the marrow and the bone, or is added outside the bone over the cartilage
For if the moisture is between the marrow and the bone and the swelling is slight, then you must make a wound in the middle of the head with a fissure that is two fingers wide so that the moisture may escape, and this is the fashion of the spatum.
And if the moisture is more increased and the swelling is great, then two fissures must be made according to this manner:
And if the moisture is outside the bone, it is a sign that the marrow of the head has been consumed throughout and the water is squeezed out when you press with your thumb on the parts inwards and not that it is in your grasp Therefore make three fissures in the middle of the head according to this manner
And extract all the moisture from the incision; then strengthen the fissures with strips and gauze; and give him wine and oil to drink until the fifth day, and then remove the dressing and care for the wound with gentle touches and grease, and strengthen the head equally; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the limb is comfortable and healed
There is another method of incision which you must consider according to the greatness of the swelling and the collection of the water, for some veins are more prominent in the occipital region, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; therefore pay attention to the incision where the swelling appears and the collection of the water, and do what you can to avoid them.
And observe that you must not pierce the artery, and if there is blood flowing from the wound, keep the patient still until the blood flow has ceased with the evacuation of the moisture.
End of Document.
When there are ulcers or tumors on the heels or toes, and it is old, do not rely on wine and medicines for their cure, for their greatest cure is the incision of those two arteries
Therefore take care when you wish to make an incision that the patient raises his head, and strengthen the limb with rough hands to uncover the arteries, and strengthen the patient's chest with some support; and consider where the vein is; and if there is any swelling in the ankles which are depressed, do not pierce them until they are in their rightful place
And take care of the surrounding area around the incision with care, and make an incision in each part which has a sudden swelling at the incision so that it reaches the bone, and do the same with the water of the head
And if you wish, after making the incision, stop the bleeding from the artery and tie the wound to the parts surrounding it
And the length of the incision should be two fingers wide, for when any vein is incised the blood is ejected with a pulsatile flow which leaps out frequently
Moreover if the artery does not appear at the incision, take three fingerbreadths of the space and take care with care, and do the same until you reach the bone
And what you must take to get from the blood is an unc. of wine and take little or more depending on the quantity of the virtue of the patient and the filling of the artery in him
And consider the wound, and if there remains anything on the bone concerning the cartilage, then you must pierce it so that no further swelling occurs
And strengthen the wound with gauze and silk thread, and care for it until it is healed

Concerning the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When there are ancient or acute ulcers that arise from agricultural humidity or because of the quality of the lacerations of the temples, or even if they are ancient and seem like those, and when these cannot be cured by the methods of medical care and wine, then we must resort to the extraction of the arteries in the temples or to the cauterization of those in the same way as we have shown
The manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient lies on his side; and understand that the incision which you see on the temple is the one which is shown by the sieve, for it is hidden in few people due to its intensity.
If it is hidden, then the hour of the patient is strong with some moisture; and quickly make the wound open with a rough sponge or vaporize the wound with cold water until the incision appears clearly. And the hour you take the sponge, this is its shape: And quickly scrape the clot at that point which facilitates the reaching of the incision; and immediately remove it from them on the outside and extract that from the surrounding parts until you have extracted that from the clot and revealed that from the covering which you have left there, from all parts
Even if the artery is small, the hour involves covering that with the tip of the finger, and immediately cut a piece of that according to the quantity by which the parts are elongated and contracted, and do not impede the flow of blood, for if they are not cut they will not be cured of anything.</end_of_turn>
And immediately evacuate blood from the wound about an inch.</end_turn> Until three.
And if the incision is large, the hour covers that you lie on two places with firm double folds of fat or with strong strings at length, and do not cover it until the decay is complete to prevent the formation of pus and impede the flow of blood.</end_turn
And immediately ligate the excess that is between two ligaments; and do this in that hour or do it at another time.</end_turn>
And if you wish, cauterize that which is pointed at the tip of the bone at the tip of the callous until the parts are cut through, and leave in its place the work which you have done.</end_turn
And it is better work if the patient has a fever or is of scaly complexion; for the cautery is of those causes which help the drying humors, and therefore it is better in summer.</end_turn
And cover immediately the extraction of the arteries that you notice on the ankle, and keep them covered with fine dust or powder, and immediately apply either a dry cure with dry medicines or a wet cure with calamine and water until it is healed.</end_turn
And if while you are working another wound begins to bleed from the incision, the hour you cover that blood, either by cautery or by tying it off, or by packing it with material, and press your hand until the bleeding stops.</end_turn And if none of these causes are present, the hour suspends the tie that I told you about on the place until the blood is congealed, and moisten the place with cold water of violent cold until the acute pain subsides, and be strong as you cover it.</end_turn
And what is more curious in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein at this point having two clips, because you have seen the two places at the attempt, and you have left out some, without igniting, until the bone is reached and the vein is divided into two parts, so that it is elongated what is between the parts, which are not consolidated by this cautery.</end_turn
This is the manner of the cautery:</end_turn
And the acute pain of the two clips is equal.</end_turn However, if there is less acute pain than with two clips, it is better, for if there is a sudden increase in pain close to either of these, it does not cause the flesh to swell with great speed.</end_turn
Therefore when there is any thickness, keep the fire of the fire in those places and the flesh is split off with ease.</end_turn
This work is better in all work and more light.</end_turn>
And the space between two clips is the quantity of the thickness of the finger.</end_turn

Of the care of the limbs affected by the acute and acidic humors of the bones.
When the humors are acidic, and it is the limb of those veins which are above the head of the femur, do not interfere in any way with the care of medicine, and sometimes the face of the patient already swells up and sits in front of walking like a walk of ants, and the bones of that limb are extended, moistened in such a way that they have already known them, and the nails are scaled by the intensity of the tears, which are the old methods of care for those who have undergone this operation, and they do not cure that care with space.</end_turn
And command the patient to stretch out their feet towards the front, and immediately make three incisions along the front, equally distanced according to the length of the front. If the length of the incision falls two fingers: one incision shall be made equally distant to the length of the nose in the middle of the face, and the second according to the length of a little more than the movement of the eyelashes which are on the lacrimal bone, and the third from the other side
And keep your hand from the arteries which are in two layers, and lengthen your hand from the continuation of both mandibles. And if the space of any incision is equal to three fingers adjusted
And if you have a piece of sponge dressed or dry cloth moist with it on those with which you cover him.
And immediately put the palm of two sharp extremities, of which this is the shape of the incision of them: that is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Excoriate at that whole the cord which is between two incisions on the lip which is over the bone, and immediately do what is of the migration from the first incision to the second incision And immediately stretch out this sponge and enter through the first incision another vein and another instrument which is called cautery, acute from one side and blunt from the other side.
And stop the bleeding of that acute one must the fatty tissue behind the cord, and the veins that descend from the head to the heel, and fill up that which reaches the migrating fissure, and cut off all the vessels that go from the head to the heel

From the care of the tears from the cavities of the head descend to the parts below the chin.
When there is an acute attack of catarrh and it continues, and sometimes the patient's feet extend slightly, and already their sight is affected by it, and their eyelashes ulcerate and their pupils dilate excessively, and in the front of the head is acute pain leading to subsequent vomiting, for these accidents the substances and the catarrh do not go out but from blood vessels of the cavities proceeding.<end_turn
And the best cure for these is that you command the patient to stretch out their feet towards the front, and immediately make an incision in the middle of the front, a little for the width (and begin with the incision of the left temporal to the right temporal; and let the incision be from the bone; and lengthen your hand from the eyelashes which are in the vicinity of the cheek), until the bone is exposed.<end_turn
Exsiccate all the blood with sponge or dry cloth and immediately replace between the two lips of the incision with an old cloth or cloth of lint.</end_turn> And immediately remove the clots from the powders embedded in wine and oil to prevent pus from forming again.</end_turn
And when you have drained all this and you see that the abscess has already diminished, then immediately care for the bones until it starts to heal, and immediately care for that which is of the regulating of the draining which makes the flesh swell, as if you were taking two loaves of wheat and four barley grains and mixing them or, in this way, make a paste and administer it to these wounds of the newly born flesh.</end_turn

About the care of what is in the ears.
Every cause that occurs in the ears is of four kinds, which are either mineral stone or something resembling stone, such as iron and lead, or of plants such as celery or beans, or of a fluid cause such as vinegar and wine and similar things, or any beast.</end_turn
Therefore, when purulent catarrh descends into the heel or any other cause similar to these, and the heel is swollen without any obvious reason, and sometimes the purulent catarrh, the hour it distils in any of these causes is of olive oil or slime, and then it must be extracted and made to vomit, and apply compresses to the area following vomiting. And immediately stop the flow of the heel some drops of fat or lint, and draw out the heel from the place it was let go, because when these fats are put on these causes, they are absorbed in this way.</end_of_turn>
And if it is not absorbed, the hour you administer the extraction of these with the instrument called epicaricary spoon, which is in this shape: ...
And if it is absorbed by the spoon, it is good; otherwise, the hour you administer the extraction of these with great caution.
Therefore, if it is not absorbed by these, the hour you make a needle of gut and insert the extremity of the needle into the cavity of the heel and close around the needle with wax and olive oil so that nothing is left except the needle itself. And immediately extract with the intestines with great traction, because these fats are seen as similar to those that we have mentioned before.</end_of_turn>
Or if it is not absorbed in this way, the hour takes hold of a lighted lamp or a vessel of the kind that is taken for these purposes, and brings a basin containing the amount of urine mentioned above, and places it on the limb, and then covers it adequately with the basin mentioned above.</end_of_turn> And immediately insert it into the cavity of the heel with ease, and immediately dry the heel from the moisture.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, if it is not absorbed by all the causes that we have mentioned, the hour you must cut off that which is causing the swelling or spasm.</end_of_turn>
And the way to cut that is to first ligate the external saphenous vein and extract it according to the virtue of these things, and then make small incisions on the border of the heel, and open the heel in the place of the fat surrounding it.</end_of_turn And the opening should be like a half moon until it reaches the purulent catarrh, and when the purulent catarrh is grasped, hold it with the appropriate instruments; and then close the opening at that moment with speed, and care that it be sound.</end_of_turn
And if the cause of the swelling in the heel is one of the fats that grow and infiltrate, the hour you must administer treatment and extraction of these; but if you do not obey my orders immediately, the hour you take sponge-like tissue from the limb in this way: ... And administer with it the excision of that fat which is causing the swelling in the heel.</end_of_turn>
And do not be astonished when you think that that is already moistened by the vapor of the heel, and place it in fat drops, and immediately extract it with nails or with a spoon, or by incision as we have said, because the extraction is alleviated.</end_of_turn
But in the water that enters the heel cover that the disease uses for vomiting at the beginning, and fill the sole of the heel with some old rags, and put over that heel the one in which the water is, and if by these means it is absorbed, it is good; otherwise, the hour you take a number of sponges and lions according to the length of the finger, and clench those on the fire for a little while, and the patient insert one of those into the cavity of his heel and beat on the other foot over the foot that is causing the heel to swell.</end_of_turn Therefore do not stop until all the water is absorbed.</end_of_turn>
Therefore do not stop until all the water is absorbed.</end_of_turn> And already when the water is absorbed you take paper or gauze, etc. and put one extremity in the heel and extend the other extremity over the fire until it is burnt out.</start_of_turn>
And immediately put on another gauze and extract all the water until all the water is absorbed, and then remove that with a needle as is said of the purulent catarrh.</start_of_turn
But in the extraction of the beast that enters into that heel, if it is small, do so cautiously and little by little, taking care of it as we have said in the division; but if it is large enough to cause awareness at the same time, the hour you administer the extraction of these with the spoon and nails, and the cause of these is less severe than all the other causes that cause swelling in the heel.</start_of_turn
When the purulent matter has been extracted from the ear, when you have cured that which we mentioned in the division and in the treatise of distillations, do not neglect to cauterize the ear opening.
And if there appears to be any cause of the worms, then extract that which is thick or slimy, even if no cause appears, then take a catheter and remove it wide open, for this is the form of them And insert the limb slightly into the ear according to the quantity that the patient is suffering from the disease; and then pour on some strong oil, and make the area moist, until all the worms are expelled.
Although if you do not obey me immediately, nevertheless, you opine and close the circuit of the catheter as we have said; then administer distillations which have already been mentioned in the treatment of worms, and you will find them in the treatise of distillations
And let your effusion be with the medicines which emanate from the oils in the ear with this instrument, of which this is the form.</start_turn> And make that of silver or of lead, straight, in which there is a small hole, and hold flat down.</start_turn>
And thus proceed as to the curvature of the catheter of containment here where it is necessary.</start_turn And if you wish, take the rays and wrap them around the lower part of the limb suitably, and then pour oil into the hollow of the auricle, or juice of any herb, or any other medicine which you wish of these medicines in the catheter – which is in the ear – and then insert the rays around the circumference and compress with your hand that which compression is temperate until the oil is expelled from the hollow of the auricle and the patient feels the oil drained.
And what is infused into the ear is already scorched with fire a little.</start_turn And take note that the cause for which you distill in the ear is not too strong, because the ear medicines do not suffer from it.</start_turn

Treatment of Ear Oiling
Some girls and young women suffer from large abdominal tumors that are not perforated, and that in many cases happen to men, oil in the meat of the ear for pain or for no reason at all; and this oil some girls find useful in the groin of the ear which does not often happen, and some girls find it in the outer parts.</start_turn
And that which happens in the groin of the ear, which does not often happen, is in the greatest degree of difficult healing.</start_turn
And when you have cured it, cover that the ear of the patient is towards the sun and keep it there.</start_turn And if sometimes the oil appears, open that which is the soft substance of which this is the form.</start_turn
If the limb in which it is small in width, of which one part is acute and the other is not; and the substance is of two lion heads so that it does not harm the ear.</start_turn
And if the oil is for no reason born in the ear or in the meat of the ear, then take that which is thick and slimy and prick that with great ease until all the matter is expelled.</start_turn
And if the oil is in the groin of the ear, then take a lion's head ray and warm that which is a little, and then put that into the meat of the ear.</start_turn
And if you smell oil in which the patient finds relief, by the gravity of the head, try to compress it easily; and take note that you do not irritate the nerves of the ear.</start_turn
And so keep on the ear marrow as much as the extent of the wound allows; and make oil for several days until you are sure of the consolidation of the plague; or take any other thing and put it in oil and sprinkle over it; and if the ear is already softened, then cover that which you have enveloped in cerate that is useful for oil, until the swelling subsides; and take care of that until it is healed.</start_turn
And if there happens to be discharge of pus, cover sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear, and use another treatment that restricts the discharge, which is mentioned in the treatise of distillations.</start_turn

Chapter VIII. Of the treatment of swelling of the eyelids which is caused by humors.
When swelling of the eyelids is caused by cold humors which infiltrate the veins at some time, some are wet and some are dry.
Therefore keep your hand over the upper and lower eyelids, and remove the cause of the swelling with the point of your scalpel. Then place your hand over the area around the eyes to prevent further bleeding
Although pain may arise from a flow of blood, when you cauterize the area with a pointed lancet, the pain will cease
And the best cauterization is when the small veins and arteries are cauterized. The humors which caused the swelling will then return once the cause of the swelling has been removed. When the humors are cauterized with fire, they are consumed and do not return
Chapter IX.
Treatment for swelling of the eyelids which arises from humors.
When wet humors are present in the eyelids, they cause swelling in their strength and hardness, and for this reason swelling is called great swelling.
And it is an accumulation of large moisture in the outer eyelid and under it
Therefore the treatment for such swelling is to consider whether it arises from the outside of the eyelid and is soft throughout; or from the inside of the eyelid and is hard. The cause of the swelling is usually mild
Therefore remove the cause of the swelling from side to side, and gently evacuate all of it as easily as possible. Then suspend the bleeding by applying pressure to the area
If the swelling is large, then suture it; and take care of it until it has healed
If it is slight, you do not need to do more than allow the swelling to restore itself and for the blood to clot naturally
If the swelling is diminishing in the outer parts of the eyelid, you should remove the cause of the swelling from the inside of the eyelid, and suspend the swelling by applying pressure to the area. Do not attempt to remove the swelling by incision, for if the eyelid is perforated too much, the pain will not disappear
And finally, after the incision, wash the area with salt water; and take care of the area until it has healed.
Chapter X.
Of the treatment for the external swelling of the eyelid
The external swelling of the eyelid is caused by gray matter which is generated in the layers of the eyelid, and is mostly seen in children. It aggravates the eyes of those who have suffered a catarrh of the eyelids; and it prevents the sun from penetrating the eyes because the tears are retained by these matters
Therefore sometimes these tears run over the face all the time, and over the face they sleep; and on the eyelids of those who have suffered from these matters for a long time, there appear wrinkles which cover the swelling. When you press on these areas with your fingers, the swelling immediately disappears
Every kind of treatment in such a case is to remove the cause of the swelling from the root of the hair, and gently remove the hair and fat surrounding it. Then form a circle around the area according to the amount of hair contained in the circle, and press around that with your fingers so that all the hair is gathered in the middle of the circle. Then make an incision along the side of the swelling, and the incision should not be deeper than the incision made in phlegmatique swelling
And finally, when you have completed the incision, cover the area until you reach the hair follicles, because in most cases the process of hair removal causes damage to the hair follicles by incision along the form of white grease.
Therefore remove the surrounding material which you have enveloped between the thumbs and index fingers and rotate between the thumb and index finger until it is dispersed
And remember not to stretch the incision too much, so that the blood does not leak from the wound, and remove the clots from the wound.
If the hair follicles do not appear at the beginning of the incision, then adjust the incision a little so that the process of hair removal is facilitated; and remove that as we have said. Then cover the area with a piece of lint and leave it for a while, and then remove the clots from the wound.
So when salt is sprinkled and they pause that in the cavity of the fissure, thus that which remains of that humidity.
And thus care for that which is sound.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if it happens in the area around the heel, then do so with blunt cautery, for that which is sound must be preserved.</end_of_turn
Chapter eleven.</end_of_turn>
Of methods for handling humors.</end_of_turn
When in the palpebras of the humors there is a natural excess, leaving them in their natural position and causing old age, these humors become acute and cause various diseases such as excessive tears and softening of the palpebras and the membrane between the humors, which is the cause of the destruction of the humor that is called the evacuation of the humor, and the cure is in four methods: either by cautery with fire; or by acute medicine as is said in the chapter of cautery; or it is useful to attach with incision and suture; or by cannas as I will say.</end_of_turn
Therefore keep your hand over the patient’s abdomen; convert the pupil of the eye with your left hand, and if it is converted, well and good; otherwise, prick in the part where it is faithful to the limb beyond the pupil, and make the needle penetrate faithfully downwards, and that which is — from the margin of the pupil where it does not move — from the pupil, draw out the thread from the parts below the pupil, and convert that part to the ray.</end_of_turn
Therefore make an opening in the part behind the pupil beyond the greater lacrimal canal until the minor lacrimal canal; then extract the thread and leave the pupil covered with small pieces of lint or wool, and close over the pupil with a bandage, like the figure of a holly leaf.</end_of_turn
But indeed keep in mind that the figure must be according to the degree of elevation of the pupil, for that which already differs among men, for some require that the incision of the pupil be made in great quantity according to the degree to which the pupil is softened.</end_of_turn
And thus make over the two lines which you have marked, and begin from the greater lacrimal canal until the minor lacrimal canal.</end_of_turn And if the wound is like that of the king, that is, large.</end_of_turn
And thus put on the sponge in one of the two angles of the wound, and then strip the whole thing, and adjust with the suture the two lips towards the belly or downwards, and withdraw the intestines, and adhere that which superflutes from the veins over two eyebrows with various means, if you wish, or otherwise do not cure.</end_of_turn
And thus keep the sutures of the veins for three days or four, and then care for that.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, leave the dressing loose from the sutures, and care for that which exudes and contracts, for the pupil is elevated because of the sealing of the wound and the adhesion of the parts; but better is to leave the sutures. Therefore I say that the old men are accustomed to evacuate.</end_of_turn
Indeed concerning the patient, be solicitous about the patient, and it is a good operation, and do not be afraid.</end_of_turn
And another method in the evacuation is that you sign over the pupil like a holly leaf, and then elevate the pupil with three nails separated and joined in this fashion:</end_of_turn
And if this is not possible, have the nails, and that which is not swollen, then take a needle which has thread and put that in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread over the greater lacrimal canal, and the thread according to over the minor lacrimal canal, and adjust between the thighs which we call the veins with equality, and then with your hand over that which you have raised elevate the whole wound as much as you have recommended.</end_of_turn
And thus adjust the two lips of the wound with suture, and care for that which is sound.</end_of_turn
And if after the incision you see that there is an aftereffect from your incision or your wound, do not touch that but keep it still and moist.</end_of_turn
Every kind of bruise that appears on the pupil that has been made by the cautery must be treated as we have said of incision; for indeed the suture in many cases is more artificial.</end_of_turn
To evacuate according to the cannas method is as follows:</end_of_turn And thus you should convert the pupil and split the figure according to what I have recounted; and for this purpose do two needles or two fine wires of such length as the length of the pupil and the width of them less than the width of the pupil. You have already pierced the extremities of any part, where you have the thread.
Then add some material under that which flows over the pupil of the eye, and tighten the threads of any part with great strength, and leave that for a while, because the cord that is for the tightening will die and become brittle and will break if it is not taken out immediately.
If it is late, however, the hour has passed the thorns, and immediately care for the wound until it is healed
When it is solidated, the pupil is elevated and the pain is gone
And this is the way to do two needles that you will do according to this form: and take the quantity of the length and the width neither more nor less
End of Document
The elevation of the pain in the eye with a needle when the pupil is hard.
When the unnatural ones are hard and rough and prick the pupils, the time for the operation is when you take a fine needle and place it in that place of soft fat and bone, and that you adjust the extremities of it so that they do not move in any way And the length of the thread is like the quantity of a palm
And thus you leave another fine thread behind, and tie the extremities of that one if you wish
Then place the patient's face down on the belly if he is able, and let the sun shine on your work so that your work is declared, for it is a subtle and small operation
Then insert the needle at the root of the pupil adjusted as necessary, and make that penetrate the pupil quickly until you extract the foreign body from the natural pupil
And thus withdraw the pupil inward and insert it into the alixate, and let the pupils remain for one or two or three and no more
And thus pull your hand away from that which has been extracted along with the natural pupil from the pupil in the eye
If it is necessary to remove the alixate from the parts beyond the thread that you have placed in that, until the alixate from the wound appears.
And thus with the vision of the eye, when you have grasped the alixate and the thread, and groan somewhat and clench the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the pupil adheres to the place and appears above that good flesh
And if the pupil is less, the time you adjust a pupil longer than the natural ones, and you elevate it in that way, or that you leave it until it is almost equal to some space, and the time you elevate that one

On the care of this inflammation that appears in the pupil from within.
When there is inflammation in the eye, and the pupil contracts when it is contracted inward or to the left or right side, due to bad consolidation of pus or of ulcer or cautery, and there is an appeal of leporine, and this is either acquired or accidental, and is useful for the consolidation of pus or ulcers or cautery, or for preserving their bad curvature
The manner of operating in it is that you make that consolidation and separate the edges of it, and place it in that where there is a piece of soft lead between them, and bind them up until they are healed
And do not neglect the care of the causes which cause it, constraint; for if you do this the inflammation will return more violently than at any other time
Use in these cases which soften as fennel thus when it is bruised, and soak with water in which they are soaked at a high temperature and seeds of lead, or ointment of ipecac, which is liquefied with some oils, and immerse that in it, and care for that one
And the treasure of your care is that you perforate with all the skill that is not consolidated in the manner that we said at the beginning.
And this operation that we have mentioned, is nothing but the rectification of this inflammation that does not restore the shape of the eye as it was before.
Capitol XIV
From the care of this disease which is useful for the palpebra of the feet.
This disease which is useful for the palpebra of the feet, which is called gout in truth; and it is of them natural, or accidental.
Accidental it is caused by a wound or by a cut or by a burn or by other means.
And the way of operating for it is that you take a needle in which you make double thread, and you leave that in the flesh, and that you pass the thread from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh
And then extend the flesh to the parts under the needle and hold that under the needle, and prick at a sufficient space And therefore if you return the shape of the eyelid according to that which covers, it is not good; and if not, take the scissors and hold that in the split figure, and on that convert the eyelid, and make the two incisions on the side of the lower eyelid
And the extremities of the two incisions are at two angles of the incision, which has been useful until they meet, and is of them useful angle until when they meet, is useful figure of them
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.
And then hold the flesh that for the quantity that is the width of the foot of the limb, so that the eyelid is held
And then adjust the separated parts and keep those under the thread of silk; and then care for those as we have said of the soothing medicines and of the bandages so that it is healthy
And if the disease must be for a wound or for a suture or for a burn, then cover that you have made with a flat incision over the edge of the eyelid according to what is preceding. And then separate between two lips according to what we have said.
In the sum of the words of the care of this disease when it is external or internal, that it runs in its operation, according to that which is prepared in the form of this disease, and that is in the form of diverse motas.
And the skilled artists always prepare an instrument in any way possible for it to make return to the natural shape, or in any other way, and that disease according to that which it is useful for the operation and the instruments in the greatest abundance
Chapter 15
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion happens to several people at once, that it is solidified the eyelid more outside with the album of the eyebrow, and that it is prohibited from the facility of movement and of its natural works, therefore cover that you enter the limb of the foot of the eyelid, and elevate in those which, or extend that with the thumb
And then prick the adhesion with a blunt needle, which is not of the sharpness of the incisions, having made an obtuse a small extent so that the disease is not disturbed by the operation, and remain the piece that does not remove the eyebrow from its sharpness.
And let your incision be such as to scratch that adhesion with ease until the eyelid is returned to its natural shape and that the adhesion is completely healed
And then put on the eyebrow in lukewarm salt water in which you wash; or distill in it of vinegar dissolved in water
And then separate between the eyelid and the eyebrow with gauze of lint, and place over the eyebrow a bandage of linen infused with oil of poppy seed, and on the third day use of astringents so that it is healed
Chapter 16
Of the incision of the nail and the emergence of the flesh of the lacrimals
Wisdom that the nail is according to two ways, that is either nervous, which is like a hard sponge; or non-nervous, which is like white moisture solidified, which when you touch it, or force it to take it with the thumb, is detached and the thumb does not stay in it
And both of these species do not begin until from the greater lacrimal which goes little by little covering the vision and prohibiting light and movement of the eyebrow
The way of working in the incision of these is that the disease does not rest its head in the belly if so, and approach the eyebrows and elevate the eyelid with your hand, and collect the nail with the thumb of little duplication and extend that to the parts under it E aprop pren una agula e entromet en aquela un pel de cavalh o de buou o de vaqua, o de semblantz, o de fiel fort, o duplica la extremitat de la agulha petit a petit e fica aquela en le mieg de la ungla, e penetra aquela am la agulha, e lia am fiel la ungla; e exten aquela a las partidas desus, e excorja am le pel le latz de la ungla lo qual siec la pupilla. And thus you will keep the blood inside the nail.
And then keep the wound open at the edge of the tear duct with a spatula or small forceps, and remove the natural tear sac so that no continuous flow of tears comes from the wound
And if necessary, nail the nail with the nail polish or thread, as we have said, and then it is enough to have spat out the sponge of which this is the form:
Beware that on the sponge do not touch the cornea and that you avoid its breakage, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then take the wound away and sprinkle a little powdered salt or do so with vinegar, and wait until the next day; and take care that there is no swelling inside that it should be healed.
And if the nail is not nervous and you cannot put in the needle, or if it is not fixed in that place, the hour is that this kind of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed in this way just like before and as recommended in the division
And if you wish to suture that, take hold of the patient and take a sponge of sponge of freul acute according to this fashion: with great care. And if sometimes it is rare and is confused and comes to that place, the hour distills from your hour in the head of the vinegar by doing with vinegar or with salt, and put the head inside the other day.
And thus repeat the operation until everything that is of it is removed, except that the cautery should not be put into the head because the hour will read that, and care for the wound at the beginning so that it should be healed.
And thus repeat your operation about that until it is healed
The swelling of the tear sac, if you notice it in the head for a great number of days, be suspended with nail; and pierce that part of it, and do not finish the wound so that no flow of tears comes from the wound
And thus distill in the tear sac vinegar and do with vinegar until it is healed

Of the suture of the garden or of what is born from a nail adjusted in the head.</end_of_turn>
Some veins in the heels of the radix are born of a yellow nail, and are over-extended until they cover the pupil, or approach or stretch over the eyelids and tightly compress the eyelids to the sides and are collected like a bundle of brushwood.
May the operation in them be that the patient keep his head still in the belly; and take hold of their heels of that and collect all that yellow nail in nails convenient to them, and take it with a forceps or with a basket; and pierce the nail at the beginning until everything is finished with the needle, and keep hold of the head that you do not damage that which you must do with your operation.
And be your suture to which you pierce those or the sponge which we have recommended in the piercing of the nail, or with small forceps as are collected together according to the form of them as mentioned in this chapter.</end_of_turn>
So when the wound is completed and all that yellow nail is removed, then take hold of the head and sprinkle over it powdered salt, or distill into powder of vinegar and similar to the corrosive medicines, and leave over the wound with cotton wool until the cauterization is certain
And if there remains any cause of gardenic and it is lordly painless, and fears cauterization, then read the head and care for the wound with vinegar until that cauterization departs, and repeat about that which has been operated until it is healed, and do the same with the nail that happened in this kind of wound
However, you must know that all care of the vinegar head by nature or by chance, or with iron, and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that that limb is suffering from that operation.</end_of_turn>

When there is collection of pus in the heel.
The pus that is in the heel is seen to fill the veins, which are thus closed off, hindering the healing process, and must be let out over a long period of days.
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning to assess whether the pus in which the heel is filled is strong or not, for there is no other disease of the heel except pus, and then you must collect that pus
And you command the patient to suspend his head over the groin, and then suspend those veins with a sponge or two according to your prudence; and let that sponge be doubled in this way:
or so two sponges gradually in a body according to this manner:
And collect those veins with fine forceps, with delicacy, and remove them an hour or two later, until those veins have become soft again and have returned to their place
Beware that you do not damage the heel at the edges of the spur; and if your operation is in the morning before sunrise, and if you are firm in your operation that you do not irritate anything except those veins
And when you have finished, when the heel is cold again, you must drain it through the opening made for that purpose so that the remaining pus is softened.
If it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, and when you have plastered everything up with that which remains, and when you have read for some days until the pain has gone away and the swelling has disappeared
And repeat this process until the patient is cured.
This is the way of the forceps:

On the reduction of swelling to the nose
When swelling has been cured by cautery or acute medicine, when it has not been cured as it should be according to the narration, do not force it but make an opening in the mature abscess in order to extract all the moisture that is in it until the bone is uncovered
And when the bone is uncovered and sometimes in its corruption or blackness, the following method must be used
It is called rough head, and is made without incision, and the head is rounded as if it were pierced with a needle (as it is in the following form).
And rest it on the corrupt part of the bone, and with your thumb rotate that between the thighs said, and press your hand little by little until you feel that that corruption is gone
And if there is some pus, restore the limb with drying and astringent substances
Therefore if the limb is consolidated and there is a good mark of healing in it, and the abscess has burst from the body and has remained for forty days, and has not been renewed and has not been washed out and there has been no accident in it, then you know that it is healed
Otherwise, do not force it but reduce the fracture to the shape of the nose, and according to this method: take away little by little as much of the soft tissue as iron or acute medicine will allow, and when the bone is uncovered, take three stripes according to this form:
The limb is triangular, and the body of the bone is first extended towards the limb as sometimes happens with the heel
And rest it on the bone, and that of the tear duct; and gently extend your hand over the limb, and with your hand rotate the limb until you have pierced all the bone, and you will feel the pain disappear as soon as you remove your hand.
Therefore restore the limb with astringent and drying medicines in this way.
Therefore when the mark and the limb are hardened, the matter which was flowing from the wound returns to the nose, so that this is the most curious thing about the illness.

On the reduction of the prominence of the heel
When the heel swells completely and does not decrease at night or during the day, the following must be done: let go of the pain, and keep following it, and give the patient rest and calm; and apply liniment to the heel which is made of acacia and aloe and beeswax and marrow, and spread out the plaster over the heel with some fine powder
The manner of the powders is that you take cloth of lions' mane, and each fold is doubled four times; and make of those folds.
And place those on top of each other according to the quantity that is needed of them.</end_of_turn> And press strongly on those with a hard and firm structure; and repeat the blistering with vinegar until it is sacrificed; and prevent the blistering and keep the wound clean and dry day and night.</end_of_turn>

From the beginning of the elevation of the uvula of the tunica.</end_of_turn
When there is disruption in the uvula of the tunica, and it is prominent and the eyelashes are protruded like a barley grain, and it is desired to remove it, the form of the home must be made for that, and the water must be instilled, for when you enter the needle into the radix of the uvula from the side towards the back, and you put the needle again in the place where the fold is doubled of the lacrimal, and make that penetrate and extract the first needle according to its position; and then you insert the needle into the place of the doubled fold and bring that part of the uvula into the circle of the needle, and press that firmly.</end_of_turn
And then extract the needle and rest over the swollen area infused with alum of lead and cleanse until the thread comes out of the eye.</end_of_turn
And care for the wound so that it is comfortable once the swelling has healed.</end_of_turn
And many times a round of all parts around the circle of the eye is gathered in a prominent prominence, and it must be perforated with the fine needle that comes out from the front of the eye, and run off the fatty moisture, and lower the eye and enter immediately.</end_of_turn

On the care of alconates.</end_of_turn
This disease which is called alconates is nothing but a wound which is adjusted in the eye resembling dew descending and is not that.</end_of_turn
But the manner of working on it is that you make the patient lie over the seat which appears swollen and protruding, and take hold of his hair at two points and do not remove it until you see the healing take place in the lower parts, and do not let it descend, and keep it clean, and the patient will see the cause of the disease just as it used to be.</end_of_turn
And if it does not descend downwards, you know that it is dew.</end_of_turn
But if it is not prepared for the descent of the healing to take place, then make the patient lie down on the lower part and take a pointed cautery and burn over that part of the cornea which is between the white of the eye and the tunica cornea in the corona (where the blood vessels are), until the healing is expelled.</end_of_turn
Therefore when it is expelled, then you instill in the eye cold water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey.</end_of_turn
And care for it with the other causes until it is healed.</end_of_turn

On the care of the dew that descends from the eye.</end_of_turn
We have already said the kinds of water in the division and what is proper to perforate with a needle declaring it, according to the healing.</end_of_turn
And you must make the patient lie down on a cushion and hold his eye tightly shut.</end_of_turn
And put your left hand over the inner eyelid, if the eye is the left one; or with your right hand if the eye is the right one.</end_of_turn
And take a sponge with your right hand, if the eye is left; or with your left hand if the eye is right.</end_of_turn
Then pause the extremity of the thumb close to the crown for the thickness of the ray in the album of the heel part of the lacrimal gland, and then peel the thumb away with force and turn your hand over.
Then pierce the heel and sit that the thumb has already arrived due to the wound.
And cover that the measure of the thumb at the crease is equal to the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the black; that is the crown of the heel; for you will see at that point the pupil with the vision of the eye for the clarity of the cornea
And pause the thumb within the socket where the water is, and then pull its tip downwards a little further, and thus if the water descends too much, the hour will see the illness above which the sight has been blurred, and the thumb in the hollow of the heel
And pause a little while; therefore if the water has descended, the hour will pause that other pull downwards since the thumb will not be broken.
Therefore when it is quiet and does not descend, the hour will extract the thumb easily, and turn it a little at a time, and then dissolve in the water a little of clear gem salt and at that time wash the heel well with vinegar; and then pause the heel outside or stop or bandage infused with olive oil and gum and put it in the water with the heel
But we must know that these things are from our time and pause over that ointment with vinegar on the heel
And if you do not obey your thumb at the entrance of the heel for its hardness — which is some of the men who have a hard heel like this — the hour covers that you take the sponge which is named alberid of which this is the form:
And therefore pierce at that joint, and do not touch your hand in the wound, and do not do so until the thumb is well joined to its place.
And thus remove the thumb as we have said.
And you must praise your work, whether it is prepared for the sleeping patient who descends with fayt in which he sleeps over two in a dark room, and whether it is prohibited from all movement.
And rest in the nature of water so that its nature is softened, and do not move the limb towards the fractured part or towards the side of the wound at all
And let the ligament be set according to its disposition within the third day.<end_turn>
And thus loosen that bandage in that dark chamber and expel the excessive heat from the sight, and make it see several causes, and then return the ligament within the day seven.<end_turn>
And do not cover that you must do in the hour of the treatments or at that time the infusion. There must be cover that you alienate water so that the water does not burn excessively and fiercely regarding the matter
But if the wound comes loose, the hour covers that you remove the heel before the seventh day, and correct that with water which flows away from the wound.<end_turn
The hour will restore the sight of the eye and pause over the face of the oral cavity for which it is governed, leaving it there for a few days, since it exists in the dark chamber.
And thus gradually remove from that chamber and speak of its causes.<end_turn>
And know that in this art not to see a few times is not excused by the disciple of vision, and the hour will be confirmed in the operation.<end_turn
And already some of those who are learned in this matter have said that it is useful to apply fire in the Ayrac magdaam which is perforated by which the water is sucked up.
But indeed we have not seen in our land anything like that which has been perfect with regard to water, or that which is lawful among the free men of the ancient times; and it is possible that this is new.<end_turn>
These are the forms of the species of magdaan so that it is about those who do not know those:
And they are useful either for ears or for iron properly, and their extremities are in this triangular shape, the acute extremity like that which is the form.

Of the treatment of the limb nothing in the nose.<end_turn
When there are various carns in the nose assembled like a scorpion's tail or like many feet of a polyp, this disease is called polyp which is like that foot represented.<end_turn E de lu es carn cancrosa, lapadea, de fusca color; e de lu es que es carn leon no de color fusca.
Therefore, in that case where the lion's carbuncle does not fraudulently or cancerously grow, cover that part of the patient's body which is causing the pain with warmth, expose the nails of the foot, and prick the area with a needle in those parts. Then extract that which has protruded from the wound, and immediately cauterize that which you have understood from the breadth of the wound until you see that the entire carbuncle is evacuated; for if any remains of it should remain as a cause of possible abscess, then immediately do what is necessary with one of the subtle instruments in order that from it no further cause should remain Or if the honourable lord rejoins us with serum or vinegar after the cautery, then immediately stop; or if it is malignant pus, then cover and cauterize that until it is evacuated and the cavities are completely healed
Then take vinegar or vinegar and water or wine on the nails immediately nearby the wound. Or if the nails are swollen and moisture has proceeded into the palate, then know that it is already healed.
Or if the moisture does not penetrate as far as the nails which are not suffering from abscess, then know that it is not pus but merely yellow spots on the nails which do not signify an abscess
Therefore cover faithfully that which is causing discomfort, do not touch it with your fingers, and wait until every digit or limb has rested for some time; then relieve the patient of the pain and introduce one limb of the body into the nail at the root or for any other cause which makes this possible
And when that has happened, that the smell has vanished from the nail before it has reached the channels of the nails, then wipe it off the greasy skin, for the girls of the school are accustomed to this action, and it is a light cause of that which you wish to make it.
Then remove both limbs of the body, one which goes over the nail and the other which remains in the nail, and immediately apply warm compresses to the nails which are in the limb.  Do this until you see that the carbuncle has been evacuated from the nails of the limb
Then extract the limb, and immediately place a bandage over the wound a distance of three days or more until the wound has healed and the carbuncle has gone away.
And finally, after the cause has passed, insert a lead catheter into the nail for several days until it is healed
And if you are in doubt about the care, use this one.
And this is the way in which the capitula is made, from which are distilled oils and medicines for the nails:
And do this with silver or gold, which is like a little lamp with a wick, as well as with a little cone, and the meat should look like this
And if you wish, make a closed tube like this, with a needle at the end of it, which is flat and uncovered; to which you must attach that when you extract the oil or whatever you want from the herbs and roots.
Chapter XXV
Of those things that naturally happen in the limbs of the nail
The nails which are naturally crooked are a great marvel and are esteemed for several days until they recover their normal shape
And for this reason you must take care of them from the beginning of their appearance, and keep them until they have healed completely And immediately stop applying the plaster or cautery or any burning medicine which you put on it
Or if it is too late for the application of the plaster to be effective, know that it is soft, dark, yellowish in color and has little sensation; do not touch that which is abscess of the nails, for it is full of great malice for that which has caused it
If the urine is yellow and not dark, and sometimes when it starts it is possible in every case, the hour evacuates the bad air and incites that sensation of fear, and heals the wound with that which exists and contracts until it is healed.
If the urine is yellow and not dark, and sometimes when it starts it is possible in every case, the hour evacuates the bad air and incites that sensation of fear, and heals the wound with that which exists and contracts until it is healed.
From the suture of the nose and the lips and the ear when the continuity is dissolved by plague or by habit
Wise people say that when the continuity of these cartilages is dissolved by an accident, little confidence is had in that operation except in the case of the wise
Therefore, when you must apply some cause of these to any, consider whether it is a fresh plague or a healed wound, and the hour you adjust the two lips of the plague to the suture, and then heal that which exists until it is healed
And if the lips of the continuity have already been separated, and some part is healed, the hour you cover that some part of your coat has appeared until it has healed. And so you adjust the two lips to the suture and strengthen those, and over those sprinkle pure salt and grease it, and place over the salt a piece of plaster of Paris or some other consolidating plaster, and leave that bound for two days or three, and then remove that and change that plaster and leave that until it has healed
May the manner of the suture be that you add the continuity of the solution or with needles just as we have recommended in the suture of the belly, or add the continuity of the solution with a thread just as well as you do and make known

Of the extraction of that cause which occurs in the two lips in the parts of the tooth.
Move gently towards those homes in the parts of the teeth of their lips some of those apostemas that are like grass seeds, and some are smaller and some are greater

Of the reason of teeth with iron
When on the surface of the teeth in the parts of the tooth and of the socket and between the gingivae are adjusted sharp scales, legs, and some veins are of black color and are harmful citrine or verdigris because the gum appears to them corrupted and the teeth are loose.
Therefore we cover that you remove the bad air between your teeth and put your hand on the head of them in the belly, and scrape the teeth in which these scales appear as sand until no remains any cause of it, and what remains of the black and citrine color and other things that may have appeared is modified
Therefore if it is late at the beginning of the reason, it is not so; but if not, the hour you repeat the reason over those three days until the fourth day comes in that in which you will be.
And know that teeth have needed various root movements of different shapes and various figures according to the way you prepare your operation. And so that the root with which the tooth is cut from the part of the tooth is another than the root with which it is between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of roots must be prepared by you which you will see many of them:
End of Document
Of the extraction of teeth
Since you have cured the root of the pain, and it is completely banished, there is no cause to fear the remnants of the disease, for they are sublime substances that are excused in the eradication of the disease.
May it be known that when the disease is definitively eradicated, that is when you must declare that the painful tooth has indeed been eradicated, for the remaining pain is nothing but the disease itself departing, which has ceased to exist in the sound tooth. We have already witnessed this in the treatment of other ailments.
Therefore, as you must declare that the painful tooth exists, and that you know well that it exists, know that it is necessary to circumscribe within the circle of the tooth wherever there is any virtue, until it is dissolved from the root of the tooth in its entirety. And indeed, this is what we must do with those who have teeth of ivory, or delicate enamel at the outset.
And indeed, you must hold the patient firmly by their large thighs for good speaking or stupor, and suspend the patient's head between the painful teeth that you must hold so that it does not swell, and then draw out the tooth according to the rule without causing greater pain.
And thus, if it is not forgotten, then take one of those instruments and put it aside completely so that it is easy and laborious to extract the tooth from the beginning.
Moreover, if the tooth is fractured or rotten, know that you must compress that fracture and strengthen that area with a subtle ray at the extremity so that it is not fractured during the constriction of that area.
And know that you must work cautiously with excision in the circle of the entire gum and keep your strength such that you do not break that area and leave it incomplete, and return over the patient for the greater part of the pain that is left of the disease.
And keep in mind that you must not do what ignorant barbers do in their frenzy and boldness regarding the eradication of their patients, since they do not administer what we have recommended. For indeed, what is left of the great diseases that remain after these people have treated them is often more difficult to extract, and their roots remain whole or some of them, or that they extract the tooth without removing the bone from the jaw, just as we have seen with certain people.
And finally, after the eradication of the disease, rinse the mouth with wine that has been boiled with caut or wine vinegar with salt.
And if blood flows out spontaneously, as is often the case with these people, then immediately sprinkle some powdered alum or sprinkle over the wound, and if that does not suffice, cauterize.</start_of_turn>
The way of holding the forceps and delicate pliers that is appropriate for grasping the tooth at the outset is either with a long handle and a short handle and a thick one, so that they do not bend when working.</start_of_turn>
And indeed, as often as with these, when you first grasp them with those of thick handle, they are not bent, but the long handle is broken.</start_of_turn
And indeed, India wire is useful for descending, and ordinary tweezers are useful for extracting teeth that are intertwined with each other and that break due to excessive force, as well as those that have a beak-like shape like a heron, which is quite common, and which require great force.</start_of_turn
End of document.
About the eradication of teeth and the extraction of the bones of the jaws that are fractured.
When you must eradicate a tooth that is fractured, know that you must suspend over the area around the affected area for a day or two until the swelling subsides; and indeed, put on an algesic or hold the pliers together in such a way as to resemble the beak of a heron called ciconia or heron, with the shape of the forceps:
The pliers are useful for grasping teeth as well as for liming or abrading them.</start_of_turn
And if you do not obey my orders with these pliers or tongs, know that you must place your hand over the root and scratch all the flesh away and then insert the instrument that has the name of a little shovel, so that the force is small like this:</start_of_turn
And indeed, make the handle of the pliers or tongs short and thick, so that it is not broken.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if the root is fractured, do not be afraid; and if not, help me with other instruments, of which these are the forms: the first instrument has a triangular handle with any thickness.</start_of_turn
The second sentence translates to:
And already with this instrument, having two ramps, this is the proper shape for the following: And with other instruments which I will describe later, whose shape resembles a razor for teeth; in this case, this instrument which is like a large spoon, and this is the shape:
triangular with a broad or short handle, of whatever thickness, and not blunt so that it is not chipped.
And another thing to know is that the instruments for teeth are like these other instruments
May the artificer be skilled and experienced in this art, for he will find for himself various instruments according to what he understands of the operation and the various diseases; for these diseases for which they formerly did not say or did not know of any proper instrument, due to the different forms of various species.
And if the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are fractured, or if there is pus, then the hour is to grasp firmly over that place with the hand which is convenient for the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and to help you with that which is the shape
and be of any size, small or large, and be bound or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely extracted; and then restore the place with suitable medicines at once.</end_turn>
And if in the bone is a little pus, then grasp that of that pus and of its blackness, and care for that until it is healed.</end_turn>

Of the care of the teeth eminent above the others.</end_turn
When the teeth are prominent not according to their natural course for those of this shape is jagged, and especially when they tend towards the feminine, and especially towards the noble gums; therefore you must consider: if a tooth is nothing to another tooth, and it is not possible to perform a filling or lining on it, then the hour lies in extracting that; but if it is not attached to another tooth, the hour you will apply that instrument of which this is the shape; and it is like a surgeon's knife, and is made of Indian steel of a fine edge.</end_turn
And let your incision be with the one which you will apply that in a few days for the hardness of the tooth, and that it is not rough like the others.</end_turn
And if a prominent tooth is exposed to filing, the hour is to file that with a file of Indian steel of this shape:</end_turn
And let it be all of Indian steel, the edge being well ground; and be of such a size as to file without causing harm to the other teeth, which may be caused by the needle. And return it to its place at the end, and grasp that of the pliers.</end_turn
And if a tooth from which a part is fractured and the tongue sticks to it, the hour is that you must ligate that until the expected part of that fragment is broken off and equalized, and be filled up so that the tongue does not stick or the word does not corrupt.</end_turn

Of the restoration of decayed teeth with gold or silver foil.</end_turn
When the teeth before suffer concussion and loosening by percussion or extraction, and the patient does not suffer from pain, and you have cared for that with medicinal substances, and it has not helped, the hour is that for so that they do not fall out, gold should be used for those that are strong, and not silver, for silver turns green and soon becomes poor in a few days, although gold never changes.</end_turn
And let the gold be of such flexibility and thickness as is sufficient to enter between the teeth; and the shape of the filling is that you take hold of the gold and take twice its length between two healthy teeth, and that you gradually increase the thickness of the gold between two decayed teeth, or if one or two, until the tissue reaches the healthy tooth of the other side.</end_turn And finally, repeat the process until you reach the part from which you began, and strengthen your hand with ease and wisdom until it is not decayed.</end_turn
And let your striction be with which you strengthen the gold be above the roots of the teeth so that it does not escape.</end_turn
And finally, insert the excess of the gold above the pliers or tweezers, and add them in every place with your hand, and convert them so that they are hidden between the healthy tooth and the decayed tooth, so that it does not harm the tongue.</end_turn And thus she reads that which is stretched out like Rome.
If it is swollen or limp, stretch out that or those as another friend in such a manner at all times.</end_of_turn>
This is the way of the teeth and the figure of the rectification of two healthy teeth and two diseased ones, thus as often as these are linked.</end_of_turn>
And when one tooth or two are returned, then immediately after that they cause some place in the area, and that they are diminished thus as we have recommended, and that they remain.</end_of_turn
And do not make anything but good artificers and wise men.</end_of_turn>

This ligament which is found behind the tongue by some women or is natural to it, or is accidental and occurs by plague which has already solidified.</end_of_turn
And the operation in it is that we burn the mouth of the patient, we saw that it does not exist in the belly; and we elevate the tongue and immediately puncture that ligament nerve according to the latitude until the tongue is freed from its retraction.</end_of_turn
If there is any hardness or denudation, and that which is left for the consolidation of the plague, when you have cut once you split that for the latitude until you have split the ligament and the nodulation has been dissolved.</end_of_turn
And keep that there is no useless fissure in the preparation of the limb and that you split here with a needle and go away with blood flow of health.</end_of_turn
And thus make the washing of the remnants of the incision with oil or vinegar or with cold water; and immediately stop leaving the tongue loose; so that it does not solidify again in any way.</end_of_turn
If there is blood flow of health, stop over the hairy area that has been injured; if the blood boils, then cauterize the place with a pointed cautery which we recommend to apply to blood.</end_of_turn And thus care for the rest of the causes until it is healed.</end_of_turn

And if at times you see yellow or black, rough, to which the patient does not feel sensation, then do not touch that which is cracked.</end_of_turn
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is humidity, then put on the thumb in it, and puncture that with a needle as thin as possible, and split it completely; and if there is blood at the time of your operation, then stop immediately with a cautery, so that it is hairy, until the blood is clotted.</end_of_turn

When they are inflamed in the throat, these are salivary glands which are joined together and which are nourished by two ears, which when you care for them with water as we have said previously and they are not healed, then you consider if the prominence is hard, of yellow color, with little sensation, then do not touch that which is iron.</end_of_turn
And if it is of yellow pus and the reason is large, then do not touch that which is iron for the flow of blood; remove that which is soft, and either you will take that out or it will break by itself.</end_of_turn
If it is of white color, radon, and its reason is subtle, then that is which covers to be incrusted.
If you consider the operation, giving your attention, if already the afterglow of the burn has passed or is diminished by any diminution; then do you do well to administer the patient the sole, placing the head of the patient on the thighs, closing the mouth of the patient, and the servant grasps between their thighs as much as the tongue of the patient allows without any noble instrument, of which this is the form:
Whether it is of silver or of gold, and it is subtle like a coat of paint.</start_of_turn>
Therefore, when you promise it to him and he shows you the afterglow, and you touch that which is on the thigh, then take hold once and stay there, and pull that which is outside as much as you can.</start_of_turn> Another thing which you must pull is any cause of the tunics, and indeed incides with that instrument of which this is the form:</start_of_turn

But if this instrument is not at your disposal, then do you incides with that sponge of which this is the form: And it is acute from one side, not acute from the other side.</start_of_turn
And having incrusted one wound, incides the other following this manner of incision, and prevent the wound from being washed by water.</start_of_turn

And the postpartum had already eaten two ramps before I arrived for two days.</start_of_turn
Therefore I held her fistularly and stayed with her once, and I pulled that out, and I took away a great part of it, and I incides that which I did not understand from the other side, and I opened her mouth, and I compressed her tongue, and I stayed with her in that postpartum.</start_of_turn
And I removed a great part of it, and there ran out only a little urine.</start_of_turn Therefore, absolutely, that is the ground of that woman, and she began to drink water and to eat immediately, so I did not stop inciding that postpartum for a long time, and afterwards another postpartum took its place of that, which I incides until that one is prolonged.</start_of_turn

From the beginning of the illness when it is postpartum.
When the swelling subsides from the limb, and it is postpartum and long, then it is not called perpendicular; and if it is in the outer part large and round, and then it is called buba.</start_of_turn
But when it is healed with the water that we have said in the division, and you do not comfort your care, sometimes indeed when the postpartum has gone out already and is subtle, then it covers that you incides that which is aggregated round; and if it is to that length, and is bloody, of a yellow or black color, and is not to its center, then it covers that you fear the incision of it, for in that there is fear of the patient.</start_of_turn
And when you do that according to the manner that I have said of its whiteness and length, that you make the patient vomit and compress the tongue with the instrument of which process is its form and stay with her until the sponge is in the new one, and pull that out and incides that with one of the two instruments which are said in the incision of two wounds.</start_of_turn
And cover that which is beyond natural limits, otherwise if you extend it too much, you will make them scream.
And reduce the incision, use of that which we have recommended in the incision of two incisions, and care that it be sound.</end_of_turn>
More if the illness is repelled by the incision, cover that when you make the burn in the cautery, do not make it too acute, for if you do, you will burn the patient. Take the tongue from the patient and take from the container the liquid which we have mentioned in the head of the cautery, and make it soft, and do not make it thick or viscous, and fill the cavity with the instrument which has this shape:
Similarly, the stretching out of the cavity where the medicine is placed is like the curve of a bowl, and rest the instrument on the medicine over the vulva. The patient will lick over the lips so that saliva or mucus from the mouth of the patient may be mixed with the medicine, so that no cause of discomfort arises from the belly of the patient and that the patient feels relief from that.
And place your hand on the medicine and press that on the uvula for a space of a quarter of an hour until it is softened and calmed by the bite of the medicine.
And if you wish, take a sponge and cover that over the limb of the patient, and immerse the sponge in the medicine, and put the limb on the sponge in a canula so that the sponge adheres to that canula, and do as many times as necessary until you achieve what you wish from the cautery of the toe, and then let that dry up so that it falls off on its own within three or four days.</end_of_turn>
And if you think it necessary to repeat the medicine, repeat that, and make the burn vanish from the circuit of the toe with the sponge in contact with the border, and mix that which is in the circuit of the medicine, and wash that with fresh water, and dry it off with a bandage, and leave it until it is healed.
And this method of care is more useful than incision and more long-lasting.
Some say that the ulcer of the uvula is cured by that which is subtler than cautery and incision, for it is cured by fumigation in this manner: take calamus, rue, origanum, rosemary, Arabic gum, chamomile, and barley, and mix them together, or some of them, in a ball. Immerse the ball in vinegar and water, and let the vinegar bubble. Put a piece of sponge over the bubble, on which place an instrument of iron according to this manner; either make it of silver or of iron.</end_of_turn>
And let the limb be introduced into the patient’s mouth until the vapor makes the uvula rise above the canula, until the uvula is not opaque.</end_of_turn>
And repeat this over the ulcer until it is dry, and keep that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an attack of fever, for it would be too strong for the fever, and do not do anything rash, but must declare the attack of fever from the cautery.</end_of_turn>
Or if you do not have this instrument at hand, take a tube and put in the limb of the patient a piece of sponge, so that the mouth of the patient is covered, for the sponge of the sponge prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.</end_of_turn
This treatment is good for health.</end_of_turn>

Of the extraction of stones and of that which adheres in the belly and of the other causes.</end_of_turn>
Ulcers adhere to the belly or the heel or any other cause.</end_of_turn
Then cover that which you see is apparent, with the tongue resting on the instrument that has teeth like teeth of a saw, so that you may be told what is in the belly.</end_of_turn
And that which is not apparent and is hidden in the belly, cover that you make the patient vomit the contents of the stomach when the food is digested in the stomach, for that strengthens the hidden cause of the belly if it is not vomited; or that you make the patient swallow the contents of the stomach with a spoonful of salt or a spoonful of radish or a spoonful of bread dry; or give him a spoonful of sponge sea salt and bind that firmly with faith, and make the patient swallow that, for when it reaches the place where the stones are and are extracted, that is when it is forgotten.</end_of_turn Or take an eel and bind it firmly to it with a thread, and when it has been extracted put it on the table and say that it has been extracted; or take a fist and bind it firmly to it and say that it has been extracted.</end_of_turn
May it be that you have not remembered those causes which we have spoken of, for in this way one must use a plum instrument in the following manner:
May it be that you have not remembered those causes which we have spoken of, for in this way one must use a plum instrument in the following manner: make it larger than a small plum, and at its extremity there should be a concavity into which you insert your thumb with ease.</end_of_turn>
And raise the cap of the thumb upwards, and keep your hand away from the sides of the wound, so that it does not press against the bone or the marrow, or that the physician puts his hand on it.</end_of_turn>
However, since the patient is more sick, because of their knowledge of the location of the underlying cause and because they can touch it, they should throw their hand at the instrument towards them, as much as is prepared for them until it is forgotten.</end_of_turn>
(The provided text continues with further medical instructions and observations.)</end_of_turn>
Extraction of the infected blood clot from the golayro.</end_of_turn
When blood clots are treated with what has been said in the division of the cure with medicines and not confirmed, consider the time in the patient's groin at the sun, for you have compressed their tongue with the instrument which you have recommended.</end_of_turn
Therefore if sometimes the blood clot comes out, extract that which is small or slightly protruding downwards adequately.</end_of_turn
And if you are unable to extract it, take a concave needle and insert it into the patient's groin, and place on the concave side of the needle a burning iron, and do as many times (until the blood clot is dead and remains in the groin) and abstain from giving them anything to drink for the whole day.</end_of_turn
And prepare a basin full of cold water, open the patient's mouth in that, and wash the mouth with that; and do not touch it with any cause and make the water flow for an hour or two with your hand, so that the blood clot dries as the water goes down.</end_of_turn
However if it has not been forgotten as we have recommended, keep the patient covered with a sheet or blanket with the instrument which we have recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.</end_of_turn
Do thus, so that it falls.</end_of_turn>
And another way of performing this operation in the fumigation of that is that you take a bowl in which are burning charcoal and cover the bowl with a cover on which there is a hole, and put at the bottom of that hole the extremity of the instrument; and immediately ignite the charcoal; and when the smoke has cleared, place the patient's mouth at the extremity of the needle, and close their mouth so that the smoke is not forgotten until you know that the smoke has reached the blood clot, for the blood clot must fall.</end_of_turn
And if it does not fall, repeat the fumigation several times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and give them bland foods and herbs, and do not drink water, and if necessary, you must take this treatment outside.</end_of_turn
And this is the form of the instrument with which blood clots are treated from the groin; and it is similar to forceps in this way as well as in others, except that it has some curvature: which is flat against the groin, and the extremity of it is similar to the beak of a heron, which is hooked, in which is grasped from five, so that when any cause is pressed, it does not slip away.</end_of_turn

In which is the sum of the word in the opening of abscesses and in the section of their parts.</end_of_turn
Abscesses are various species, of various methods, as remembered from this book.
And they are diverse in perforation and section of them by two methods, of which one is for the species of abscesses in themselves; and for what compresses of humidities.</end_of_turn
And the second method is for the places where the accidents of the body occur, for the abscess that occurs in the head is different from the abscess that occurs in the buttocks; and the abscess in the fleshy part is different from the abscess that occurs in the joints; and each one of them must be treated by operation.</end_of_turn
And there are some abscesses that must not be perforated but must be treated at the proper time of the evacuation of the pus in them or alongside them.</end_of_turn
So, if other symptoms appear which cause them to tremble when crossed, and which are not mature according to their degree, thus also symptoms which are proper of joints, because a symptom that appears near a joint will extend throughout that circuit until it reaches the outermost parts of it, and will corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, because of the cause of contraction of that limb; or is a symptom of a principal limb, and if you delay the perforation of it until it is mature, it will not harm the principal limb; or is of the heel, therefore perforate only when it is not mature. Do not perforate carelessly, except for an improper digestion, but only when it is of the heel, so that you do not weaken the heel and make it elongated at the distant parts of the heel, and so cause fistula, or that it be in the end that it is not healthy. Indeed, you must know the time of perforation of the symptom, and that is when it is mature.
And you must know that it is mature when the pain ceases and the fever subsides, and when the swelling and pulsation diminish, and the sharpness of the symptom, and the other signs
And that you must know to perforate when the pain subsides and the swelling diminishes from the root of the symptom
And the perforation must always be made either along the bone or the limb, if the symptoms are in the parts of the head or the feet, and in the place of lacerations, of the strings of nerves, of the arteries; and in general, in all the places where there is no reflection; for in those where there is reflection, use perforation according to that limb
More than when the symptom is in a fleshy place, the time is that you must read the perforation of it as soon as its digestion is confirmed according to degree, as we have said; for if you perforate before that, it is prolonged the course of the disease and its mortality, and it makes the edges of the limb stiff and deep
More, some symptoms must be perforated according to the breadth of the bone or the limb, as necessity demands, or according to what the limb digests.
And you must administer little perforation, in great symptoms great perforation and wide or many sections according to the diversity of the size of the symptoms
And others are those symptoms in which you must consider the tendon to be concave and inflamed, when it is useful as well as when it is in the end that it remains, just as in the case of drunkenness and swellings
And of those which are indicated with a section having three angles; and of those which are indicated as in the shape of a sickle leaf, just like the symptoms of the ankle bones
And of those which are indicated with round section and crescent section, and which are similar to these
More, he cannot say that to those to whom it is not possible like external symptoms that appear on the surface, that you must perforate only with superficial perforation, or only flat.
And you must know that when the symptom is great and has already collected a lot of healthy matter, that in this case you must perforate it and do not hesitate to extract everything at that time; having extracted a part, and then put back the symptom inside the other day, and extract another part greater, and so on until it is completely cured
And more if the illness is of cold temperament, or fever, or a small child, or an old man in decrepitude, for the vital spirit of animals is resolved with the evacuation of the unhealthy matter, and thus the illness is cured, and you must do the same.
Keep this chapter with great care, and consider your perforation in which you perforate these symptoms, because you must remove the swellings and take into consideration whether the swelling of the symptom is little or is a flat section, when you administer which of them or the antidote; and if the symptom is great, and the tears of the perforation are many, you must pause mechanically until they come together.
And if in the symptom a part of the tendon is detached or has been depressed in the circuit, you must surround it with old cloth or thread of silk, as when you have carried pans or razors, with moisture; and strengthen it on the third day; and repeat the process until it is healed.
More, if blood flows out in the hour of your operation, you must administer cold water and vinegar in which there is a piece of silk, and pause that over the area of the flow of blood until the blood clots have formed.
And if the bleeding persists, you must administer regimen and care and powders which I have recommended in many places of our book and division
May it be in wintertime, the place of the apostemes is a place of moving nerves. Therefore cover that you are pouring powders of vitriol and oil from a cautery over the area.
And if it is in summer, and the area is fleshy, then cover that you pour powders of alum or with oil or with wine and oil. Keep it moist until the third day, as we have said, and cover that you remove the apostemes and evacuate the abscess and administer healing to them until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
And thus is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of apostemas universally, namely according to the way of distinguishing we have already said of every apostema in what manner it is the way of caring for them individually.</end_of_turn>
Chapter 61.</end_turn>
Of the incision of apostemas which occur in the groin of the chapter.</end_turn
In the groin of the chapter there are small apostemas, and of species of knots which contain tunics that are to their making; and the species of them are movable.</end_of_turn
And from these there are pus, and those that contain humidity resembling lime.</end_of_turn And from those that contain humidity resembling urine, and resembling lead; and from those that are soft.</end_of_turn
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of those which are not to be feared, as when you extend those which are not to be feared.</end_of_turn
And the operation in the incision of these is that you grasp them with an instrument of the kind that you see here, which is called entromes, until you see that it contains.</end_of_turn
For if what is contained is humidity, then cut that by incision according to length by superficial incision as follows:
And begin in the incision of the line of B to the line of G. And when the humidity is evacuated, then you should excise that by which that humidity is contained, and do not leave any cause of it, for if there remains any cause of it.
And immediately immerse the limb in unguents of Egypt, if present, or in water and salt; and fill it with that the wound and leave it until tomorrow, for it is because of that that the water corrodes all that is left of that membrane.</end_of_turn
And do this again about the limb in unguents of Egypt repeatedly and finally if you wish, until you are confident that there remains no cause of that membrane; for the wound will be cured by the unguent until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the apostema contains fatty nodes, then you must cut that as follows:</end_of_turn by making an incision without form of cross, and grasp nails between two edges of the incision and remove that from all around, and strive in the extraction of the tunic that contains that.</end_of_turn
However much your incision may be contrary, then do that which I have recounted to you first.</end_of_turn
And in the same way do in the lapiliferous apostemas of incision and care as you have heard; and the incision of the lapiliferous apostemas is lighter, for it is of little pain and little humidity.</end_of_turn
And there are many physicians who are accustomed to these apostemas which are in the head in the bones of old women with whom there is no humidity; the cause of which is that I do not know how to dissect an apostemal in the head of an old woman and I cover the apostemal as if it were a deaf, rough, white stone, which could not be squeezed out, and if any of you should wish to do so, please cover that.</end_of_turn
However in other apostemas that occur in the head another is not this chapter, namely those which occur at the heads of children, and you must take the reason for the oedema, for example, the cause of the swelling of the tonsils, however the incision of these is superficial only.</end_of_turn
And stop the perforation of those from the lower part downwards so that it may alleviate the body of the pain to the lower parts.</end>
And take care of those with that which is convenient to that of care.</end>
Chapter 62.</end_turn
Of the incision of scrofulas which occur in the collarbone.</end_of_turn
The fat that accompanies these apostemas is enclosed in the collarbone and in the breastbone and in the armpits; and some accompany these in other parts of the body.</end_of_turn
And thus those that happen in the groin, and those that are generated between them, and all scrofula of these is outside their own tunic, just as in the nodes and abscess of the head, just as we have recounted.
The species of these scrofulas are boils, which are some that have rough edges, and those that contain moisture, and those that are malignant which do not yield to treatment.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, in that part where you sometimes have a good disposition of the touch, where the color of that which is manifested is proper to the color of the codena, and which is harmful throughout, and which is not annexed to the nerves of the groin, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, and which is not pulsating, because you must prick it with a needle so that it does not spread further from the surface of the part down to the part outside the body along the line of G. Enter the line of B, and scorch it throughout. Extend two lips of the codena on all sides, or on three sides if necessary, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.</end_of_turn>
And it is more cautious not to prick the vein or nerve.</end_of_turn>
And let the sponge not be too acute, that you do not put your hand too close to the wound, or that you frighten the patient, and that you do not prick anything that is not necessary to prick; for if you prick the vein or artery you will prevent your operation, for when you pause in the plague of the vetriol trissat or other powders which remain flowing from the wound, open the wound and leave the contents that remain in rest until the inflammation has subsided and the wound has become softened and the swelling has gone down.</end_of_turn When the wound has been closed.</end_of_turn
Therefore return to your operation as soon as you have finished.</end_of_turn>
And if there is any other small scrofula in the groin, inquire about it and prick it and remove it.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the root of the large vein, cover that so that you do not prick the large vein.</end_of_turn Be careful that you keep your hand firmly doubled strong and that you leave that which falls by itself spontaneously.</end_of_turn
And then fill the wound with old cloth which you have already soaked in vinegar Egyptian, and care for it.</end_of_turn
And if you prick the scrofula throughout, cover that you adjust the two lips of the wound and keep them pressed so that no pus escapes.</end_of_turn
If sometimes there is escape of pus due to the greatness of the scrofula, cover that you understand how to prick the root of that, and remove that and administer sutures and what is said.</end_of_turn
And as for those scrofulas which contain moisture, prick that with a superficial perforation here where you see the maturity of them, and stop perforating when the pus has gone down from the belly, just as we have said.</end_of_turn
And administer the perforation cautiously, with lukewarm water and similar to those, to prevent any damage to the surrounding area.</end_of_turn And when the wound has already begun to heal, care for it with warm water of the kind which generates within it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter LIII.</end_of_turn>
Of the incision of the heel of the abscess outside the knee.</end_of_turn
I say that this incision in the heel has never been seen by anyone in our land.</end_of_turn
And this is the inscription of this sermon.</end_of_turn
And in women there has never been an excision, for it is avoided for the extraction of the heel, as for which reason it is not useful for helping with the pain of all the veins and the major arteries of the patient.</end_of_turn
And in those who have abscesses caused by bites in the mouth or heel or two nails, when the disease is not in the bone, cover the use of the incision of the heel to avoid the loss which is useful for perforation.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you want to, prick the heel outside three circles of the circles of the heel, or four at a small distance for the width in that which there are two circles for quantity, that the incision be in fat, not in cartilage, and this place is suitable for incision, for it is private of flesh and the vessels of the blood of the wound are loosened.</end_of_turn
If the doctor is inexperienced, cover the time that the golayro extends the knee on one leg, and then make an incision in the knee until it reaches the canal, but avoid the vessels of sanctity if they are seen for any reason.
And so make an incision as we have recommended; and it is significant to section the canal for the flame which is in that eye that is from them disrupted and for the evacuation of the pus.</end_of_turn>
Leave the wound open for some time.</end_of_turn>
Therefore when the hour is ripe in which the perforation is feared, add two layers of skin to the edge of the wound, and so only will the cartilage remain.</end_of_turn
And then give medicines that make the flesh disappear until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And say of Albucasis that the sum of the words that we have recommended, exposure is nothing other than to see that some of these afterpains have already oppressed the golayro of the disease, and the disease is overcome by death, and the spirit has departed from it, and these remain to puncture the epiglottis so that the disease can breathe over the area of the wound for every breath, and be saved from death.</end_of_turn>
And thus I command you to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease has passed; and the malice of it is for three days; and therefore I command you to close the wound when it is healed, and care for it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And what I have seen in my practice is that a servant brought a bowl and put it on the knee of the patient and made an incision in that part of the canal of the lung, and I was called to care for it, and I covered the mucus like it is done from the dead, and uncovered the wound and covered the blood that was there with the saliva that was in the wound little.</end_of_turn
Therefore I confess that no vein or nerve had been pierced, and that the blood had gone away from the wound, and it was healed when it was healed.</end_of_turn
And I did not blame the servant if she did not recover from the wound, and I told her that she would recover at the disposal of her abilities.</end_of_turn
And now I say that in the section of the epiglottis there is no fear.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn>
Of the section of the apostema which happens in the external golayro, and is called hernia of the golayro.</end_of_turn
This great apostema called hernia of the golayro is great according to the color of the flesh, and is not in the women.</end_of_turn
And it is according to two manners, either it is natural or accidental.</end_of_turn
And in the natural one it is not the work of healing.</end_of_turn
And the accidental one is according to two manners, one of which is like grass knots, and the other is like an apostema which is caused by the swelling of an artery, and in that one there is fear.</end_of_turn And do not make an assumption about it like iron, but only in that one which is small.</end_of_turn And you must know that if you find it like grass knots, and it is not suspended by any vein, then you must puncture it just like the knots, and extract what is in it from the skin and the fat; and if not, the whole body must be inspected to find out what is causing the pain, and to take care of the area until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn
Of the section of the species of knots.</end_of_turn
Of these knots there are many species and I have already mentioned all the species in the division.</end_of_turn
And it must be known that I recommend the difference between a knot and an extrusion as it causes doubt.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that in an extrusion there is heat and fever and violent pain until the inflammation of the superfluid has ceased; and it is completed by corruption when the fever, the pain and the heat cease.</end_of_turn
But a knot is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and contains that lion's head which is to the sac itself.</end_of_turn
And it is according to the color of the flesh, and it begins like a cheese and is done just like wax, whether it is greater or smaller, and there are two species, one of which is like grease and contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I have said in the division.</end_of_turn
Therefore cover, when you reach the care of the node, that you expel that one and inquire about that one at the beginning as it is called internal medicine, according to how it appears in the capital that is appropriate for this.
And it is a custom to inquire about apostemas and all nodes, that you grasp this pain and introduce that one into the place where you find it in the apostema, and you will remove the strings said with that little by little until you know that the pain has already penetrated the skin
Then finally place your hand according to the measure of the size of the apostema, and extract the intestines and consider what is left of them.
And if the current humidity, whatever its color, has been discharged, then you will scratch it superficially as I have said in the other apostemas.
And if there is no longer any humidity left from the intestines, then you know that it is fat
And dry it over them in the shape of a cross like this: thus as taught, and suspend that one on nails, and strip the skin from all around easily, and keep the skin or sac, if possible, over that and extract that pus from the node.
May be it is broken in the operation, it is not possible to extract that pus, and many clots are seen therein, and you will extract it piecemeal until no cause remains of it.
For if there remains any cause, little or much, the node returns according to the way
And if sometimes some small part remains, then complete the wound with a few sharp corrosive powders and stretch the wound, and place your hand over that which is called apostema cauda, and care for the other cure until it is healed
And if it is a large node, then you will hold its two lips and care for that which encloses
May be a pulsating vein is contrary to it, or not pulsating, then you will cover and fill the place of the scattered hair that is old and rough that is there and that streak for two days or three until the wound is healed and the fever has subsided; and then return to scratch what is left of the node.

The form of the large intestine is like this:</start_of_turn
The form of the small intestine is like this:</start_of_turn
They are made of iron, of alum, of fallen limbs conveniently, so that they can retain the intestines within the apostemas.

And they are made of black plum seeds, which are remembered that for those the fistulas are opened in the concavity of which they are reflections, which are reflected back with their elevation with those reflections.</start_of_turn
And there are three species, which are some of them long, and others medium, and others short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the stricture of it.</start_of_turn

The forms of nails are of various species, some being simple, having only a curvature, and others of three species: large, few and middle.
And of these there are blunt nails, and three species of them

And of these there are nails that have three curvatures, and three species of them.

Form of a large nail having two curvatures: Form of a middle nail having two curvatures Form of a small nail having two curvatures
Form of a large nail having three curvatures
Form of a middle nail having three curvatures
And these are the forms of scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and scorched, and there are three species, of which one is large, one middle, and one small.
Form of a large scalpel
Form of a middle scalpel
Form of a small scalpel
The extremities of those with which the cutting is made are sharp, and the others are not sharp, and they are not to be grasped in such a way, but rather because it is necessary to do so in order to avoid the incision of a vein or nerve, and for those that it is useful for the health of the patient and to bring tranquility in a small way to the discomfort which is found alongside the excision of the abscess.
These are the forms of dressings, and there are three species: large, middle, and small, like herbs
They are useful for wool and resemble hair like the one with which one makes alcohol.
And it is in the extremity where the point is pierced with a covered spatula and in which one runs towards the buttocks and the outside, when you wish, like those which you see
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers of the hand, make the perforation of abscesses and do not perceive the diseases, and there are three species: large, middle, and small And these are the forms of these:
The forms of winds with which the flow of blood is obstructed, and there are three species: large, middle, and small; the forms of them:
They are useful for citrus wool, round with some length, and they are subtle
And you must know that these three species of winds are necessary in order to obstruct the flow of blood with velocity in necessity, and when you do not take them at the first opportunity it is not medicine.
But do not use them to obstruct blood in any part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places, like in the abscesses of the limbs and the buttocks, and in the abscesses of the veins, and of the breasts, and of the belly and the groin, and it is like that of fleshy abscesses of moisture.
And many vegetables are useful for these small things resembling fish scales according to this form; for which the blood is obstructed when it is necessary for phlebotomy, or for incision of a vein or artery.
Every vein is round according to this fashion.

More so if the breast hangs downwards towards the lower parts and is softened by its magnitude just like women, when it should be cut into two equal parts like a sickle, at two lunar figures, of which each one contains the other at the end of each one, until the major line contains the minor line in this fashion from the line of B to the line of G.

These apostemas that come from behind it titillate are of the species of scrophulas, firm, which contain a membrane that is a sac.</end_of_turn
And of those which contain humidity; and those which contain humidity cover that they should be incised in the lunar phase according to this figure: from the line of G to the line of B. And when everything is evacuated from the apostema of the marrow, then you should fill it up with old cloth and remove it the next day.</end_of_turn
And keep the wound both outer and inner treated with convenient ointment until it is healthy.</end_of_turn
And if the apostema is of the species of the nodes, and of the scrophulas, then you should cut over that as we have said in the section concerning the scrophulas evenly.</end_of_turn
More so if the wound is extended in such a way that it is difficult to reduce, then administer in it cautery as we have said before.</end_of_turn

Concerning the incision of apostemas that occur by ligature or by vein.</end_of_turn
When the ligament is broken, and the cord which is over that is consolidated, then move the veins that occur from the apostemas and the signs for which it is known that they inflame and apostematize are for the artery or vein: for when the apostemas are for ligature, they are long aggregated in the front of the body; and when they are for a vein, sit on them where it is stuttered.</end_of_turn
And that which is for a vein is round to the manifestation of the body.</end_of_turn
And the incision concerning this apostema is an error, especially in those who are in the aisles, and in the armpits, and in the groin, and in many parts of the body; and it is not great, so cover that its cure by iron should be avoided, and that which is in the limbs, or at the head, should be avoided.</end_of_turn
More so concerning that which is for the inflammation of the orifice of the ligature, cut in the cord section in the long; and immediately cover the incision with nails and hold the ligature, and remove the tunics until it is revealed.</end_of_turn
And immediately put over that needle and make it penetrate through to the other side, and open the ligature with a firm double fold in two places, — which causes you to see the two arteries which are in the temples.</end_of_turn
And immediately put in the place where there are two ligaments with space between them until it is healed all that is in it, and dissolve the apostema.</end_of_turn
And thus administer treatment in which poor blood is engendered until the ligaments relax; and treat that which is inflamed conveniently until it is healed.
And if it is necessary to ligate a a vein section, then keep your hand there where the ligate is to be made, and introduce the needle without causing further damage to the area where your hand has been placed, and make that penetrate; and when you have made that penetrate, withdraw that from the other side, and then ligate the ligate with gut as I have said concerning the gut of two parts at two extremities of the thread.
May be if you fear that you will pull out the thread, then introduce the thread with that needle without causing further damage to the area where the first needle pierced, and strengthen the knots in four places.
Then dry the ligate in the middle of the area where it is, so that when it is seated there that which is ligated will be fixed.
And thus place over the powder which you have soaked in wine and oil, and thus administer the treatment which is useful with lukewarm and inflamed parts until it is healed.
Chapter of the ligate which is caused by the twisting of nerves.
Thus also occurs ligate in the skin and in the vein, and in the same way occurs ligate in the nerves when they are injured by percussion or by excessive work, and in a similar way.
And it is more useful in the places of the assistants or the heel, or in any place where the joints are swollen
And it is a grievous ligate, and is similar in color to the rest of the body, and is in the greatest part of its course accompanied by great pain, sitting in the midst of the patient resembling stupor.
And it is not a common ligate in the precordial region of the body, and therefore leave the cord in place, and do not touch anything more widely than is necessary and do not reach forward or backward
Therefore concerning those which are in the joints, do not allow that they should be squeezed with iron, because that would cause greater pain.
And that which is in the head or in the front of the cord tighten the cord with a pad. And if it is little ligate, then keep that which is above the forcepts and cut away that which is from the root of the cause
And if it is great, then keep it suspended with a bandage, and excoriate that, and then ligate that; and suture the wound with gut, and treat that until it is healed
Chapter end.
Of the section of the ligate which occurs from the heel that occurs to the belly
Then towards the buttocks of those who have seen many wounds in the belly of those and in the other parts of the body of those who are affected by fungal affections like those which are in the fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is bulky; and already the lips of those are withered, and is of those which is small, and is of those which is not remarkable
And I have already seen one of these, and in the belly of it were two patients who were like fungi resembling each other, and there was no difference between those which are white, of little root.
And already the lips of those were wrinkled and split, and moisture ran from that all the time.
Therefore I instructed them and bathed one in the foot that was not so bad. and the other one that was like a wound in the foot
And as for the operation concerning the incision of them, you must consider if the patient is moist, and if the color of their nails is white, moist, of subtle root; then you must ligate with a pad at the side of the thumb, and while you are there make a cautery in the fire, because the matter which must be expelled from the wound must be expelled without leaving a wound; and if you must leave it clean, cauterize that.
And if sometimes the patient is pale and fearful, do not make the incision with an iron; but keep the needle firm of late make a point, and strengthen that nail; the manner of which is that which we have said; and leave that for two days.
And thus tighten the gut of the nail; therefore do not stop strengthening the nail greatly until it is detached and comes out by itself.
And if it is of great root, then there is some cause of fear and pain in the incision, and especially in that which is in the belly
May be it is possible that you will dissect the great toe, and then cauterize that part so that it does not return.
And take care of that which remains until the wound is healed
And beware that you do not presume to dissect that which is of fatty color, of little sensation, of little regard, for that which is abscess is cancer.</start_of_turn>

From the care of the great physician of the belly.</start_of_turn>
The great physician of the belly is useful for many causes; or for fissures of the liver which are above the belly, and which is why you should remove the cloth or intestine according as it is in the other ruptures; or for healing which flows from veins or arteries as is said above, or for cramps caused by excessive air in the belly.</start_of_turn
If it is for a fissure of the liver and for vomiting of the cloth, know that the color of the vomit is similar to the color of the body; and that it is painful, and that it appears in various situations.</start_of_turn If it is for the discharge of the intestine, know that the situation of that which we have recounted is of many various kinds, as you have already said that which is hidden is said to be occult; and that you must return it; and it is very painful for it, and is much lamented by much of the people.</start_of_turn
If it is for humidity, know that it is not occult when you place your hand over it, nor is it constricted, nor is it swollen.</start_of_turn
And if it is for healing, know that at this time the vomit appears black declining.</start_of_turn
If it is for nothing, know that the vomit is difficult, thick and rough, and is fixed according to a quantity.</start_of_turn
If it is for excessive air, know that it causes discomfort.</start_of_turn
And the operation in this case is that you must consider that if the great physician of the belly is for the healing of a wound of an artery or of a vein, or for excessive air; you must abstain from the care of the belly, because in this case there is fear and danger just as I have said concerning the vomiting of blood and of pus.</start_of_turn
And if the great physician of the belly is for the intestine or for the cloth, know that you must command the patient to lie down and extend; and that you must place your hand around the circumference of the entire belly, and command him to stay between your legs on either side; and that you must surround the belly with a sponge of lint around the area which you have mentioned concerning the vomit; and that you must stretch the great toe towards the buttocks as much as a great hand; and that you must tie in the circumference with a strong thread or a needle and thread.</start_of_turn
And you must take hold of the great toe which is extended over the ligament and insert your finger into that place and say that you will extract the intestine; and if you have not grasped it or held it for the ligament, know that you must extract it by force and push the intestine into the parts of the belly.</start_of_turn
And if you have found the cloth, know that you must take hold of that with one hand; and cauterize the superfluous parts of it.</start_of_turn
If it is contrary to your vein or artery, know that you must surround that place with a bandage, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and make two holes firmly in those two fields and insert two needles into the circumference which you have made around the vomit in the manner of a cross, which will pass through; and then strengthen the vomit in four parts over the needles.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, leave the needles and rest until the extended limb has fallen down by itself; or cauterize that when it is subtle and has fallen, and take care of that which covers the intestines until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the great physician of the belly is for nothing in it or for humidity, know that you must compress the vomit as we have said and extract the wound or the humidity which you find in it, and take care of that which covers and consolidates the area.</start_of_turn

Book of treatment for cancer.</start_of_turn
We have already said in the division about the kinds of cancer and how it is to be treated with medicine, and that it is dangerous in it the treatment with iron so that it is not ulcerated; and we have said that cancer is engendered in the great toe and the caution in the treatment of it.</start_of_turn
They say that certain vegetables cause swelling in the groin which is impossible to eradicate, just as it is with those which are in the breasts or in the thighs and in their limbs.
When it is old and fat, it does not matter that you take care of it, for I have never seen it healed by any remedy or that it has been overcome by anything.
The operation for it is when it is allotted as we have said, that you precede and lay aside the patient and purge from the bowels black several vegetables, and then sprinkle on that, if it is found to be replaced with something visible
And then prepare the patient as for the operation in which he is located, and prevent in the wound the needles which cover that; and incline from all parts of the body towards the codena, so that no cause remains of the reasons of it. Leave running the blood, and do not bind that urgently, express the wounds, and withdraw the fat blood with your hand or with an instrument.
When it makes you angry the great bleeding of a vein or an artery, then cauterize that until the flow of blood is stopped, and then care for that as for the other care within that it is healed.

Chapter 3.
We have already mentioned in the division the species of hydrophobia of water, and their signs, and the treatment for them with medicines
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of althitas alone, and is not approached with iron to the species of timpanists or to the species of yposarcha, for that is deadly.
And when you have medicated this species of hydrophobia of timpanists with medicines and do not relieve the pain, then consider that if the patient has already achieved complete freedom from pain, or is affected by another disease, as if it were in his throat or belly and resembling those, do not give him iron, for fear of that.
And if sometimes the patient is tormented by excessive vomiting, and there is no other disease but pure hydrophobia alone, neither young nor old, then the manner of the operation for it is that you hold the patient between your thighs, and express his belly with your hand, filling the water to the level of the fifth finger, and take sponges according to this manner:
both in two parts acute long, with an acute extremity thus as sponge; however, do this gradually in small amounts, so that in the operation there is no passage into the belly, and that you leave that.
And consider if the generation of hydrophobia is from the bowels, for in that case you must remove from the navel to the amount of three fingers beyond the fifth.
If the generation of hydrophobia is from the disease of the spleen, then your incision should be to the left of the navel for three fingers.
If the generation of it is for the liver, then your incision should be in the back
And do not let your incision be over the rib where the patient wants to vomit, for fear of breaking the blood vessels there
And pierce with the instrument all around the navel, and enter into that incision, and raise your hand with the sponge between the navel and the stomach, and you will expel that; and if the amount of an eyelash or more comes out
And pierce the stomach until the sponge reaches the place where the water is And extract that and insert an instrument of this shape: and it is similar to a silver cannula; it is made of silver or ivory or lead, to which in the lower part is a small hole, and on the sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and it is finished with the blunt end like a pen, as sometimes:
And at the end of it there is an arm, which when the instrument reaches the water, immediately stops over the instrument, thus evacuating half the amount of water in the meantime, for if you evacuate less than that in an hour, that will mean that the patient has died from the resolution of the vital spirit or from the approach of death itself.
Evacuate thus according to the quantity of the vomit and according to what you understand from the patient's disposition concerning the sickness of the vomit and the hardness of his bowels
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water that causes it, for the cord that retains it is over the sac from which it is recommended that you perform this in the same manner.
Then repeat the instrument several times if the patient tolerates it, extract a small amount of water, and do so for several days in fear, and guard yourself from error until the water remains only a little
However, if you fear the patient, and you see a great amount of water, then let it dry up in warm sand, sprinkle it with bath, and wait in the sun for a long time; and care for that which has been given drying medicines until it is healed
And cauterize on the stomach, and the belly and the flank, close to the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.

Regarding the care of children who have not yet opened their urine bladders.
Some mothers of children do not pierce the head of the mixture (or it is pierced too straight or not at the right place).
Therefore cover the child as much as possible so that it is born with a little spur as in this manner:
And immediately stop the flow of the mixture with a plump plum clamp and tie it, and do so for three days or for four days
When he wants to urinate, let him urinate freely; and then return that
And if you do not clamp it, it is possible that the urine that goes over the place will not reach this clamp
However, if the flow that comes from the bladder is straight, it must be treated with a plum clamp, as we have said, for three days until it is strengthened
However, those in whom the flow is not in the right place, that is to say, the cause of which is that the opening of the bladder is too low, must elevate the bladder with their hand to the parts below; and this is not a natural production, because the sperm cannot reach the woman according to the rule, and is a bad disease for women
The manner of performing the operation for them is that the patient be placed over the two hips, and extend the head of the bladder with your left hand with great extraction, and pierce the head of the bladder at the navel with a needle as if with a pen, or that you do not tear away any part, so that the semen comes out like the head of the bladder and the flow falls into the right place as you cover it.
And take care that in your operation for the flow of urine, that no other wound occurs; and stop when you see the bleeding stop, and care for the wound until it has healed.</start_of_turn>

Of the swelling which occurs in the prepuce on the head of the bladder, and of corruption, and blackening, and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the bladder.
Many mothers observe that this swelling occurs in the bladder and is a sign of a bad wound
And of those one is malignant and the other is not malignant
Not malignant, because you suspend with a single suture and close that when it is whole; and immediately place over that ulcer submerged in Egyptian unguent; and do so until that has healed
And if the swelling is malignant, of dark color, then you must administer pointed cautery near the incision and the ratio of that.
However, if the swelling is in the prepuce at the head of the bladder and is not circumcised, and a part of the swelling is inside the prepuce and the other part is outside, then you must take care that the swelling which is inside remains until it is consolidated; and care for that which is outside, because when you have cured that, since you have cured that which is inside, it is not certain that the prepuce will not be torn
And it is seen often in the genitals and in the prepuce blackness and corruption, where you must take care that you remove everything that is already decayed and that is already corrupted or that is already corrupted; and immediately apply over that whatever is better, which is composed of fine flour of millet and of fine blood-clots and fragments of hair.
And take care of that which is left over until it is healed.
May be if there is an influx of blood, then administer the lunar cautery in this manner:
When the lunar cautery is to be used twice, as for blood-letting and for purges when they are corrupted.</end_of_turn>
And if the head of the bladder is burst and is destroyed in an hour, then insert into the meat of the prepuce a a tube of lead so that the patient urinates through that.</end_of_turn>
In the adherence of the prepuce to the head of the bladder (and this adherence does not happen except in the case of those from whom the prepuce is naturally detached, and over them circumcision is not required; and when it happens from purges or from edema) it is necessary to remove the spicate substance from the area until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the bladder is completely freed.</end_of_turn
And if it is difficult to remove them [the spicate substances] entirely, then you must remove the spicate substance from the area of the head of the bladder and the prepuce, and aid in this that when the prepuce is soft, when strong it is perforated for its softness excessively.</end_of_turn
And then separate between the prepuce and the head of the bladder with a strip of linen, which is already wet in the cold water so that it does not adhere to any other part.</end_of_turn
And then apply some astringent with two fingers until it is solidified.</end_turn><end_turn>
End of treatment.</end_turn>
Regarding the circumcision of children and the care of those who have undergone circumcision.</end_turn><end_turn>
Circumcision is not a solution to all ailments as are other diseases: however, just as in any other operation and will, and especially in children, it is necessary to assign in this better operation and way more light any possible loss of life.</end_turn><end_turn
Therefore I say that the ancients did not perform circumcision in any of the free times, because they did not find it in their laws, and it is only because we have learned through experience that the majority of artisans and barbers use to circumcise and to mend using new and curious methods; and they use thread and needle for ligature and needle for suture.</end_turn><end_turn
And I myself have tried all these methods and I have not found a better method than the one with forceps, thread and needle which, when applied to circumcision as to the nail, causes the cord to be expelled more easily, because the cord of the prepuce is split into two tunics, and the tension is left below, and when strong it is forced to another incision and pain is certain.</end_turn><end_turn And in circumcision which is performed for almsgiving, and which is digital, of which use the cobblers, it is not followed the incision of the extremity of the member viril, because when strong it enters into the tract of the latter.</end_turn><end_turn
However, in the operation with the needle, when strong it breaks through flesh and corrupts your operation.</end_turn><end_turn And the cord of the child is short by nature, and often these women do not apply themselves in this way that it does not require circumcision, and I have seen it.</end_turn><end_turn
Therefore, from the circumcision made with forceps and thread and needle, the benefit, experiment tells me, is that the forceps are in proportion to the incision, because the pain that is above is just as great as the pain that is below; and therefore as you press your hand in proportion to the two pains, and you insert according to a comparison in a time; and it is useful to compress the thread with a figure containing the cord of the bladder entirely, to which there is no error of any kind.</end_turn><end_turn
And the manner of the first operation is that you must make the child groan if he is of those who understand little, do not make him groan but simply tie the thread in his scrotum alone, and that you watch that he does not die before tomorrow.</end_turn><end_turn
And in this way do those who are able to receive his intelligence. And do that you are between your most statuesque preparations, and do not be sleepy; and hide the forceps in your hand or leave them in his foot, so that the child does not see them or any other of the instruments.</end_turn><end_turn
And then put your hand on the scrotum and blow on the cord, and pull that until the head of the scrotum is released, and then mend that which is added to it by the pus.</end_turn><end_turn
The way of the forceps at modification, this is the way:
One is wide and the other is narrow, so that it does not go beyond the nail, and the length of the two acute angles is as long as two thumbs together.</li
Greater is the error in modification when it forces the intrinsic knee outwards, or parts from it the incision.</li
Therefore you must extend the one from your hand towards your nail facing the apostema of the limb and that you make the incision according to equality.</li
And if you cannot hold it at your nail, then extract it at the nail and make the incision there.</li
Greater if three days have passed, and it remains swollen, leave the dressing on; when the callous boils down, then read what is inside that it is released, and extract that which facilitates it, and make that one as it is prepared.</li
And take care of the head of the limb, because it will not suffer from it.</li
And therefore care for that in which the wound consolidates from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.</li
And if the knee is incised in measure, and you obey its parts, then you will not notice it.</li
And greater care for that in which we have said that it should be healed.</li>
Chapter 58.</li
Of the care of retained urine in the bladder.</li>
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by fullness due to stones or sand, or for poverty or meat, and it is similar to those we have said about the methods of care in the division.</li
And if it is not dissolved with what we have said, it is useful to know the cause of the patient, for then you must administer extraction from it with an instrument which is called a siringua, which is like a silver or lead lion claw, with a tube of lead with a length equal to that of a palm and a half, to which there is a tube of lead at the head of it.
And the way of extracting the urine from it is that you grasp the tube doubled and tie it at the end of the hair or root for good support; and insert the ends of the tube into the part beyond the siringua, and prick with the forceps if there is any cause of the hair, but without introducing it into the tube with violence. And then increase the siringua around the border and with an egg of oil.</li
And do the patient lie on the side, and bandage the bladder from it and the limb with oil of ravens, olive oil and vinegar.</li
And thus remove the siringua easily when it has reached the level of the limb; and then bend the limb back from the navel; and then pull the siringua out again; and then put the hand into the bladder, and the patient will be relieved of the cause of the pain, and it is not useful to order otherwise, but only the meat in which there is discomfort.</li
And slowly pull out the tube with the hair little by little, so that the urine follows the hair.</li
And extract it and do the care of the urine, and use the siringua, do not do anything else, and use the siringua until the bladder is evacuated and the patient is relieved of the pain.</li
Chapter 59.</li
Of the quality of irrigation of the bladder with a clamp and similar instruments which are in agreement with what has been said.</li
When an ulcer or abscess occurs in the bladder, or is surrounded by gravel, or is obstructed by stones, and you wish to drain water and medicines from that, then it is necessary to use a clamp to hold that.
However, if the stone is silent in its passage, then it is closed.</end_of_turn> And in that case there are three tracts: two from one side, thus as many times.</end_of_turn
At the beginning it is liquid, in which that which is peeled is immersed, and as much as it is pressed, its addition is within it, until when any cause is overcome by that which is expelled from the humors, whether it is expelled, and when it is expelled long, as much as the clamp which is held by naphta in the battles of the sea.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you wish to expel humors from the bladder, insert the clamp into the humoral mass, and expel that water which is immersed in those parts, because the humoral mass is expelled from the concavity of the clamp.</end_of_turn
And insert the clamp into the area according to what we have recommended in the ringing; and expel the humoral mass with water, because that humoral mass remains in the bladder in that way, and the patient is cured of that.</end_of_turn>
This is the shape of the subtle cry of the one whose bladder is crystallized, and that is the shape:
Whether of silver or gold, from which neither hand can make anything resembling a small pen, and leave it hanging without touching it.</end_of_turn>
And then take the bladder in hand, and suspend the humoral mass that you wish to crystallize in the bladder, and then tie that between two strong ligatures made of firm thread, and scald that humoral mass over the fire.</end_of_turn
And insert the clamp into the area.</end_of_turn
And place your hand over the bladder with the humoral mass stretching downwards until the patient feels that that humoral mass has already reached the bladder.</end_of_turn
Even if there is no bladder present, when you take hold of a bundle of rags and make a circle from that; and pierce that through its entire roundness; and insert the faithful thread firmly into those tracts, even if they are revolting; and join the circle so that it is joined like alum, because you pause in that water from which you wish to expel the humors, and smell and water.</end_of_turn
And then join that one on the instrument and make like that which has been made with the bladder, and express from your hand until the humoral mass reaches the bladder.</end_of_turn
The end.
From the extraction of stones.</end_of_turn>
We have already said in the division of the species of stones and their care with medicines, and the difference between stones generated in the phlegmas and stones generated in the bladder, and we remind you of that.</end_of_turn
And we have said the stone in which the cat operates with the hand, and section.</end_of_turn
And the stone which is generated in the bladder itself is that which is fixed in the bladder.</end_of_turn
And thus we have narrated that which is the exhibition and abbreviation.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that the stone which is generated in the greater bladder mostly appears in childhood; and concerning its signs, the urine which is emitted from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and appears in that sand; and the patient has frequent pain in their groin, and dark spots appear in the urine; and it is dressed in that way; and in that water there is often seen to be clotted blood.</end_of_turn
And it is strange the healing of the children of that so that they have reached thirteen years; and the treatment is difficult in the old.</end_of_turn More so in the young because it is between these.</end_of_turn
And of that of which the stone is greater and the treatment is easier; and if it is little, it is contrary to that.</end_of_turn
Therefore when we reach the treatment of that, cover at the beginning of that which modifies the patient's pain in the groin which extracts all the wound that is in the groin; for that wound many clots prevent the poisoning of the stone by the inquiry of them.</end_of_turn
And then be present the patient's pain in the groin and count and massage the thighs for so that the stone descends into the belly of the bladder, or that it jumps out of place and some clots appear.</end_of_turn
And thus do that which is most ready among your hands, and the most of them are left in charge of their things, so that the bladder is entirely emptied downwards towards the lower parts.
And thus do that which is most ready among your hands, and the most of them are left in charge of their things
Therefore if you feel the stone in the space, then do so to such an extent that you cover it all around with incision over it
And if you do not feel it entirely let him touch it slightly, for it is to be said that if the patient is a child, you say "left hand" and if he is an adult you say "half", and put that into his belly button And thus do that the stone be left outside him And convert that little one little by little into the belly of the bladder
And thus do that which is in that place that you have mentioned, and expel that towards the outside of the body where you saw the incision.
And command the minister to hold the bladder with his hand; and command another minister to extend the thighs to the outside with his right hand, and with his left hand support the pubic bone which is left behind the thighs, at the part where the incision is made
And thus do that the spleen be spontaneously expelled of which this is the form: and split it in it where it is between the hip bone and the thigh bones, not in the middle part, from the lateral side of the left thigh; and let the incision be over that stone and the hand be said to be either in the hip or in the groin, and let the incision be a transverse one, for the incision outside should be wide and not narrow according to the quantity of what comes out of the stone is to them possible, and not more, than that which can be comfortably grasped by the hand which is in the groin with the stone against the incision.
And know that of the stone there is some that has an angle and margins, for that its evacuation is difficult for it.
And of that which is like a lion's mane, and is round, and is difficult for it to evacuate
Therefore if it is that which has angles and margins, adjust it in the fissure
And if it is not easily evacuated, then do so that you cover over that with your hand, or that you grasp it firmly with your hand over the stone, and do not remove it from it; or that you insert your instrument under the limb.
Or if you are not able to do that, then do so that you increase the traction a little, and if you see a flow of urine, cut through that which is sharp.
Or if the stone is greater than one, then do so at the beginning of the operation you press your hand to the mouth of the bladder, and do so that you strike over it; and do so that you press a little bit of urine; and do the same if there are more stones of two.
Or if the stone is large, it is known that you make a large incision, for that causes the patient two evils: or that it remains or that it continues to discharge urine, because the place is not completely consolidated
Or give evacuation to it until it is expelled, or reduce in the fracture of it with forceps until you extract that in pieces
And when you have completed your operation, then do so that you fill the wound with lint of aloe and bandages of silk, and grasp that firmly And keep it covered with oil and vinegar, or with oiled gauze and vinegar, so that the wound should be softened
And keep the patient lying down on the bed, and do not remove the dressing until the third day.
And when that is gone, bathe the place with water and oil, and take care of that which is to be given on the next day and on the next day until it is healed
Or if in the wound there occurs postoperative inflammation, adhesion and swelling, and that because the urine is prohibited (and that is known for the escape of urine with the urine), then insert the hand again into the wound and extract that urine, for if it remains it causes the bladder to become corrupted and putrefied
And do so that you wash the wound with wine, water and salt, and against all spices, against everything that might impede its healing until it is healed
And cover all the care in these times that you lie both thighs together and adjust the medicines that are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the groin, and is fixed there, and there is an aversion to urination, it is customarily cured by cutting; for this treatment is accused of cutting; and indeed I have seen it done thus; and I command you to take a needle of iron, of which this is the form: ...
... triangular, extended, acute, fixed in flesh
And immediately take hold, and lie against that groin so that the stone does not return to the bladder.
And immediately insert the iron into the groin, perforating easily so that the needle comes out to that stone. And rotate the needle in your hand over that small stone, and you will perforate the stone until you have pierced through; for the urine will flow freely then
And immediately place your hand over that which is above the stone that has fallen out of the groin, which is drunk, and is full of urine, and the patient is healed
Maybe if this treatment does not seem suitable for any cause that you prohibit, lie down a thread so that the stone remains, and another thread to pull out the stone. And immediately cauterize over the stone in that groin between two threads And immediately pull out the stone. And immediately loosen the threads and bandage the wound with oil, which is useful in the disease.
And it is not necessary to leave a thread to hold the stone, but only that it does not return to the bladder, and the other thread to pull out, for when the thread is loosened up the stone comes out and the pain ceases.
And for this reason when you pull out the thread, elevate the limb above the wound, or that it returns to its place, and the pain will cease as we have said

Of the extraction of a stone from the thighs.
A stone in the thighs is rarely engendered
But if you see a stone in any of these, the treatment is difficult and is prohibited by skilled doctors
One of them is that the strong limb is verges.
And the other is that you do not find the limb bent, as if it had been cast by the doctor when it was whole, or that it is from a limb that has had a fracture
The third is that you do not find the limb well known, especially the operation with the hand
And the fourth is that the location of the incision over the stone in the thighs is far from the location of the stone, for fear of causing swelling, and in that there is danger
But if you must do it, cover that you take a large limb well known, and that it is not easily found
But if you are lacking these, cover that you bring a large maid or a mistress of the house, or a noble lady who has had her limb amputated in this area, or a woman who has had a fracture in this area
Therefore do that which I command you, and order her to do everything that I command you, from the inquiry about the stone from the beginning; for it is necessary to know if the limb is verges, for I want the stone.
Therefore if you find it, cover that of leaves said, and I command you to order her to make the incision over that.
But if it is not verges, I command the mistress to put her hand over the area of the wound and over the stone, since she should place her left hand over the bladder, and press that over well understood
Therefore if you find it, cover that gradually move that from the orifice of the bladder to the parts beyond until it reaches the level of the cushion
And immediately make the incision over that position of the palm of the hand where the cushion has been placed and hold the stone in that place, so that its hand does not slip from the stone
The section should be small at the beginning; then interpose the needle over that section, and if you feel the stone, adjust the section according to the quantity you know the stone will yield from that.
You know that the species of stone are various: some are small and great, some are rough and sharp, some are long and round, and some have ramps.
Therefore you know how many species there are of these for which you sign about what you want.</start_of_turn>
And if you see blood flowing, adjust the wet thread tightly for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your work until the stone is expelled.
And make ready all your instruments which are needed for extracting a stone in men, so that you may be assisted by them in your work.</start_of_turn>
And if you see blood flowing, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that is blind, then you should stop the bleeding by pressing over the area and opening the wound slightly, and do not proceed further; leave the stone and do not extract it, for it will cause the patient's death.</start_of_turn> And take care of the wound.</start_of_turn>
Therefore when the pain of the blood has subsided somewhat after a few days, and the wound has healed, then you can return to your work until the stone is expelled.</start_of_turn

On incision for an abdominal hernia.</start_of_turn
An abdominal hernia is nothing other than the accumulation of moisture in the white sac which contains the intestines, and is called a hernia.</start_of_turn
And sometimes the veins are in the proper panicol which nature has prepared in the belly part of the fluid, until it is known that there is already another fluid; and that is the cord of the genetia between the white sac which we have mentioned, and it is not blood but pus.</start_of_turn
The generation of this hernia is due to weakness in the ligaments that join the intestines, because in these some of this matter is deposited; and sometimes it happens by a violent blow that is inflicted on the intestines.</start_of_turn
This moisture has various colors, for its color may be like lemon or blood-red, or even black feculent, or it may be clear and white, and this is the best.</start_of_turn
The signs by which one knows that this accumulation of moisture is in the white sac that we have mentioned are: for when it is in that sac, the swelling gradually decreases in length somewhat like a figure of a fish, and the intestines protrude, because the moisture contains all around them.</start_of_turn
And if the moisture is in the proper vein, then the swelling gradually decreases from the belly part and thus it is believed that there is already another fluid.</start_of_turn
And if the moisture is between the cord of the genetia and the white sac, then we must leave it alone.</start_of_turn
And when you wish to know the color of the moisture, then you should uncover the color of the moisture in the swelling while cutting away what precedes the form; and according to what is left in the residue, judge what it contains.</start_of_turn
Therefore when we come to the treatment of it, we must command the patient to be flexible if it is possible, and sometimes to lie down flat.</start_of_turn
And put a little cushion under the hips on both sides for any reason, and stop leaving them moving around with a cloth.</start_of_turn
And place yourself on the left side of them, and command the minister to follow on the right side of them, who should extend his hand to the groin and the belly part.</start_of_turn
And then take a pair of scissors and make an incision through the cord of the genetia from the navel to the groin along the ribs.</start_of_turn
And the incision should be made with accuracy, equidistant from the line that should be drawn on the skin of the genetia, until it reaches the white sac encompassing it.</start_of_turn
And remove that, and observe, and take care so that you do not injure the intestines; and the discharge which you will see from the incision will be somewhat bloody and viscous according to the quantity that is possible.</start_of_turn

Then separate between two layers of the limb with a saw, and extend the foot to its parts below; do not touch the sensitive area of the groin, and pierce the foot in that manner that is convenient to you. And pierce it entirely or in pieces, and more importantly with a subtle saw, for if you do not strictly observe the incision of the wound, it is not safe that the water will not return
More if in the course of this treatment of your groin in the hour of your operation, when you have completed the incision of the foot, return that again, and then suture together the two layers of the groin with sutures, and take care of this as well as the rest of the wound, until it is healed
And if you find the swelling corrupted by another disease, then know that you must ligate the vessels that are causing the swelling, and extract the water, and take care of this as we have said before.
More if the water is added in two parts is enough, know that these are hernias; therefore pierce that part as you have done with the other swelling; and if it is up to you to do so, do it.
Then take away the dirty clothes, and enter into the sections of the wound submerged in oil or scented oil; and stop the bleeding of another bandage which you have submerged in wine and oil, and expand it over two thighs and the belly; and stop over layers of cloth doubled and powder, and tie those over as it is in this manner:
and take two cloths and fill them with coarse wool according to this fashion; and tie the extremities with which it is customary to cover the knee or with wet wool, and add them to the structure in the groin of the thighs, and one of the extremities will go into the groin of the buttocks and the other to the part of the ankle, and two extremities over two toes and two others over two knuckles, and all the tightening should be adjusted in the groin of the thighs.
And every other hernia of this kind is treated artificially with cautery in place of incision with iron; and it is that you take a pointed cautery and insert it into the groin of the genitals, and ignite it as we have recommended until the white sac containing the water is discovered, and then you take away the cautery in this manner: And it is assembled in the Greek letter.
And then pierce that sac, and it is ignited until all the moisture is expelled.
And then extend the foot with a saw, and burn with a saw, and burn with pointed cautery; and pierce that as it is convenient to you until you have eradicated everything; and take care that the fire does not touch you
Know that this operation is more safe and lasting than an incision.
More if after the saw or the cautery, or the flux of blood, you find any other opposition, know that you must care for what causes you pain with care, as you are accustomed to doing for them.
More if the ailment is slight, and you do not hope for a second operation for its horror, know that you must perform the perforation as we have recommended; and it is when it is confirmed that you must do so, for that which we have said concerning the significances, that the hernia is harmless.
Know that you must keep the ailment over any high swelling, and then pierce the swelling in the lower part of it at the level of the heel, and stop the perforation according to the length of the limb.
And let the perforation be wide enough to drain out all the water
And then place over the area the heel and tie that and leave that, so that the water remains drained out And take care of that until the wound is healed
More if at the emptying of the water at that moment you pierce that: and that is not useful except for that in which the white puss in the orifice of the wound causes opposition and prevents the escape of the water, know that you must put in the wound a little or some instrument with which to extract the water from the abscess, the form of which is preceded; or adjust in the oppression of the wound a little bit of something.
And know that the water returns, and is added about six months or in the spring of those; and when it is added, know that it must be perforated in that same manner, for the ailment will be passed over in those seven days

Wise men say that in the section concerning this hernia there is fear of loss of consciousness in the greater parts; for I see its remission and its saving by that means.
And I remember the operation in that and the herbs of the apostemas
Therefore I say that the apostemas arise in the bodies in which the genetius are composed and is caused by various causes: or for sudden excess of blood, which is spread on the genetius, or for percussion
And its color is according to the color of the body, and it is not found in pain, and is a hard apostema
And the soft apostema is pale, of which the color is dark, and it does not swell to it
And many physicians say that it is useful for the swelling of arteries and for the inflammation of those veins as soon as the memory of them is perceived, or for the inflammation of veins
More than that, that which is for the inflammation of arteries is known by the dispersion of the apostema when you compress that area in the belly which is called that; and do not touch that area
More than that, that which is useful for the inflammation of veins is not dispersed by any cause because of the compression of that which is said
And it is possible that concerning this species it is useful to make a section and about the other meats; and that you introduce the root of the genetius, and spread the hair of the parts downwards, and extract that from the white fat, and deliver the serum of the vessels, and ligate them, and introduce more serum than you deliver from all the parts of the hair
Therefore if the blood has already solidified in those meats, the hour covers that you extract the blood and introduce that
And if there is adherence for any cause of the fat, or between those which are between the veins, the hour covers that you deliver all that adherence and introduce that by incision around.
More than that, if it is born from meat in the place of the adherence which is behind, the hour covers that you introduce all that is of it, and extract the blood as we have said
Therefore when your operation is completed, the hour fills the wound with soft wool soaked in olive oil and vinegar; and take care of that at the other care which is to be done until it is healed

Of the care of hernia that is of long standing.
When it is enveloped by any covering similar to a sprout with the softening of the testicles, it is useful to exercise difficult movement and walking on the patient.
And in the care of this disease it is for fear of that which precedes the memory.
But we must say the operation in which the first appearances are fierce
I say that you should place the patient on a high cushion; and spread the serum of the testicles to the lower parts; and introduce the root of the genetius to the belly which is called that between the veins; and have these other attendants that you wish, and extend those with violent extension
And introduce with a sharp knife an acute incision across the belly of the vessels until they are discovered
And extract from all parts as we have said in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples
And leave in those a needle with a double head, and ligate that at the first place where the pain occurred, and ligate that other vein at the back of them And introduce those in the middle of the body for an acute incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is added of the foul and corrupt humors.
And take care of the wound with the care of the other wounds in which you wish to cause the vessels to fall which support one of the two genetius, which is not bad for that.
More than that, if all the veins are injured, the hour covers that the testicles are extracted or that the testicles are so weakened by the veins that they are private of all nourishment for the injury of the veins, and that they are established, or that they are weakened so that they are not useful for that.

The development of this hernia is by incision that proceeds over the abdomen from the flanks of the miracle of the belly, because having given way the bulges of that rupture to some of the bulges.
And this rupture is either of the spleen or of excess of them, and these two species happen for various causes: either percussion, or vomiting, or crying, or elevation of any harsh cause, or by remaining in some way.
And the sign of this, when it is for extension of the spleen, is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen immediately, and is accompanied by swelling within the belly so that the spleen compresses the intestine
And the sign of this is when it is for incision of the spleen, that at the beginning it makes acute pain immediately; and it is accompanied by swelling different from the usual, leaving the navel prominent, and that is because of the swelling of the intestine, and the body of the spleen to the parts beyond the spleen
And every vein that is outside the belly is forgotten about for the intestine, and this hernia is called intestinal hernia
And some veins are caused by windiness, and some veins run in the belly wound, and here it is retained, and it is with this that great pain is caused, and some veins cause great pain especially when they are pressed
And in the care of these species of this disease there is fear, for that one must avoid the danger in that.
And the way of operating on this is that you command the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand to the parts below the circumference of his cavity if he obeys your order, and you should place a swab over the hernia between your thumbs, and elevate the legs of the patient
And you should tighten the navel which is the navel of the testicles towards the parts below, and you should cut the navel of the testicles throughout its length; and you should tie in two knots at the ends of the incision as much as you wish to open the incision with these
And if it is possible for you according to the quantity that you are able to do that from that from which you must remove it will be forgotten.
And you should wash that part which is left the navel of the testicles, until the white spleen of some part is discovered
Then you will enter the intestine called in this way that you cut the testicles, in that which is between the white spleen which is left the navel of the urine, and between the spleen according, and you will remove everything that adheres to that part behind the urine
And you should touch with your hand the navel of the testicles to the parts beyond, and with your left hand extend the white spleen towards your left hand, and elevate the urine towards the part of the incision; and you command the minister to extend the urine outwards and you will dissolve the adherence that is behind with a completed solution.
And seek among the intestines that there is no cause for the intestine being covered in the white spleen May be if you find it in the belly you should leave it there
And you cut in the part behind the navel of the testicles for the incision from which runs clean and healthy just as we have recommended when we said it.
And you administer soaked gauze in oil, and wait on the wound; and you administer the thread which we have recommended (and some veins the white spleen is cauterized, which we have said previously in fear of the flow of blood, because many veins happen to those) and you tie the thread until it falls by itself.

And the treatment is like that which precedes the narration.</end_of_turn
And many veins are cured with iron in this manner: that the patient lies over the heel of both feet between your hands, and then dry the area of the rupture of the abscesses examined along the border according to the quantity of three fingers.</end_of_turn

Of castration.</end_of_turn
It is known to us that castration is forbidden in our law, however I remember it in this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except for two reasons, of which the first is that a physician should know how to cure it when he is questioned about it; and the other reason is that we often need to castrate other animals for our youth for those, as well as mares, oxen, pigs, and other animals like those.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that castration is caused in two ways: either by extrusion or by incision at the root.
In the case of extrusion, the method is to cut off the animal in lukewarm water until the testicles become soft and limp and hang down.</end_turn> And take hold of them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to be painful.</end_turn
In the case of castration caused by incision and section, you must hold the animal and grasp the root of the testicles with your left hand.</end_turn
Then ligate the sperm sacs, and make an incision over each testicle with a section until two holes project outwards.</end_turn
And immediately make an incision wherever there is any swelling.</end_turn> Do not neglect any cause of pain, but take care of the subtle pain that is over the vessels.</end_turn><end_turn>
And this method of castration is better than extrusion, because extrusion causes pain in the testicles and the animal desires to mate.</end_turn>

More flesh is born than that which is in the horror of the mother until it fills up that space, and when it is great it is sent away to the parts like that of a dog (and for this reason it is called “intestinal disease”); therefore we must cut it away just as we cut away the constipation, and care for that until it is healed.</end_turn

Then take a cloth and soak it in oil and place it over that area, and keep it there until the area is softened.
If the swelling is large and thick, then cover that with some wool or a piece of myrtle leaf
If the swelling is for meat, then suspend that with one hand, and cut that with the other hand.
And let the medicines be those that stop the flow of blood from the wound, such as vinegar, alum, and saffron, adjusted with oil of herbs.

I have already mentioned in this treatise the common cause of gout, which is the accumulation of stone in the joints, and if you wish to know how this operation is performed, I shall tell you.</end_turn>
Therefore, if you consider that the pain of gout in the heel begins acutely with percussion and swelling and fever, and sometimes with swelling and if you touch that area, do not hesitate to perforate it, and care for that which will help promote healing until the acute symptoms subside.</end_turn>
And therefore, you must make an incision over a painful area having two fingers; recline over the foot two cushions and adjust the patient's legs below the belly, and spread out the patient's buttocks, and place your hand over the area that causes pain, and hold tightly as required.</end_turn
Then call the midwife and bring the instruments that are required for this operation, for their form will be seen in those causes that make it necessary.</end_turn>
Therefore, when you are about to administer this instrument, stay close to the opening of the heel, and do not let anything that comes out of the instrument be more than the opening of the heel and cause harm to the patient.</end_turn If the instrument is larger than the opening of the heel, then you must cover the surface of the opening with powder to prevent any other instrument from entering the opening of the heel.</end_turn
Therefore, you must hold the vein that runs in the instrument from below and the minister should hold the instrument and rotate the vein until the opening of the heel is reached.</end_turn
When the evacuation is completed, and it is grasped with the hand and is bloody and viscous, then you must cover that with a piece of cloth.</end_turn
When the healing is evacuated, then you must place a soaked wick in a bath of olive oil or green oil in the area, and hold the dressing in place in the opening of the heel.</end_turn
And keep the heel still and over the wound apply a clean bandage soaked in water in which are boiled mallows.</end_turn
And care for the wound for two days until it is healed, and give it something to drink until it is healed.</end_turn
And many physicians wash the heel and the wound every day with water and vinegar, and give them something to drink with water in which there are boiled lilies or long pepper, and return to the drink.</end_turn
If the wound is deep in the heel and cannot be cured by force, then you must refrain from treating it with instruments, having cared for it as we have said in the division.</end_turn

To teach the midwives how to perform these procedures in cases where natural methods are not sufficient.
It is necessary because the midwife must first know the normal figure of childbirth in order to recognize the signs of abnormalities, and when the woman gives birth and desires to smell the air, and when she is distressed about what is above her and about her navel, it is because she is in an unnatural position.
Therefore, when you see these signs, you must compress the abdomen so that the fetus is slightly flexed when it descends on the head, and is delivered with the second stage, and is protected from those excesses with good management.</end_turn
Since that part is not natural and should not be used, for when the fetus comes out on its feet and the body of the fetus is in front of the head and the feet are under the head, and the hand or the foot touches the heel... ...or the head and the hand touch the heel, or the head is over the belly, and it turns into the position of the illegitimate figures.</end_turn
It is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skillful in all these cases, and to guard against error and deception.</end_turn
I have shown you all the figures of these things, and what is their meaning so that you can understand and remember them.</end_turn
When the fetus comes out on the head naturally and is violent on the woman, and is difficult for her, and sometimes the power of delivery is already exhausted, then you must do what the women have to do, and expel the fetus with fennel seed and fragrant oil.</end_turn
E aprop entrometa la metrona entre les sieus ditz espatum petit e fenda am aquel la segondina, o secce aquela am la sua ungla entro que corro aquo que es en ela de humiditat. And press the belly of the woman until it descends the fetus.
Maybe if it does not descend, the hour covers that the woman is moistened with slime of peas and slime of fenugreek around the navel
Then order them to compress and clench that which must be expelled with force; and seal their mouth and nose for an hour, so that the fetus will be forgotten for a long time
And if two-thirds of the fetus have been forgotten from the beginning, the hour covers that you reduce them gradually little by little. Maybe if they do not obey the treatment, the hour pauses the woman on a stool and lifts their feet up, and then supports the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held that she does not fall from the concussion
And if the greatest part is not taken away and the fetus dies, the hour records that and extracts the fetus from the belly or binds its body to the hand and extracts that which is equal, because that which is forgotten will be forgotten
When the fetus is on the thighs, the hour covers that you press them inward, and then make the fetus small, and that you fill that which is lacking, and that you grasp a foot of it and extend those little by little
Maybe when they are like this within the cushions, the hour orders them to cry out, and make that they be expelled with force, for if God wills it, that which is forgotten will be forgotten
And if it is not forgotten in that which we have reckoned, the hour returns the fetus little by little until it pauses that according to the natural figure, for that which is forgotten will be forgotten in the curiosity of this moment
And if it is prohibited in everything that we have reckoned, the hour takes from high musellage and sticky gum, and pierces all over the foot for good percussion, and then brings up the afterbirth from the belly of the woman, the fluid from the belly of the fetus And then make that incision in water, until it reaches the navel cords.
And when sometimes the parts leave them softened, the hour gives them a fumigation of marjoram and pauses that for them<end_turn> And when the fumigation has lasted for an hour, the hour orders that it be made on a stool, and then make that it be expelled and extract the mouth of it, and take that away, and press the lower part of the belly of it lightly, so that the fetus will be forgotten for a long time.
From this point on the fetus is latently hanging with one of its parts. You may attempt to reduce the hand, but if you are unable to do so, the hour raises the woman and lets her go down
And if she cannot go down, the hour makes her sit on the side, and with great force shakes the cushions of her with concussion, and then administer to her the things which you gave her and the things which you recommended of mucilages
And if it is urgent to deliver, the hour orders that it be made on a stool, and then studies the reduction of the hand, and fills up the fetus according to the natural figure, and makes the woman expel and orders her to hug herself until she is forgotten.
The foot is swollen, and the area around the ankle is two-thirds larger than normal. When the mistress has the foot in hand and slowly turns the little toe outwards, it is easier to do so
And when it is soft and when it is inflamed, and when you pause your hand over the heel where we have recommended oil and unguents.
Then command them to move their hand slowly, and when you see that it is done, command her to rest on a cushion and command her to incline her knee towards the outside, and command her to compress; and do this until the vomiting stops The fetus is prepared to exit through the wide opening
When they suffer from horror of the mother in this way, consider it, and then you will find that the second one will depart with the moisture from the humidity.
And if the foot is suspended over the face and the ankle, then you must prick the navel, so that it is not retained and remains.
And then pull the foot downwards as much as you can until it pauses, and command the woman to press against her chest several times, and when it is let go of, do not forget to look at the foot immediately, if it is God or no other
The birth of twins or many feet Be wise that twins born from many veins are not born at the same time, and sometimes one or two are not born, for this is strange and should not be; for this is not from natural causes, but from the devil.
And tell them that whether they are multiplied once or twice, when they are separated by the navel cord, they distinguish those inside the ligament in the belly of the womb from those outside by the navel cord of those who remain. And every vein which is not delivered is forgotten just as if it were a foot for a natural birth, and so sits several veins for an unnatural birth like we have recommended
And if they are difficult to deliver, you must encourage them and persevere until we have mentioned the unnatural figures, then you will care for them just as we have recommended
And if the mistress is subtle and does what is easy and subtle, and is prompt, and is ingenious according to all figures as she is prepared from the impending danger to health.
Remember that which is formed in the matrix from embryos and is aborted
Some herbs are formed in greater ones, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and ten, and indeed I must verify that a woman who has had six miscarriages will not have ten, for this causes great pain according to the knowledge of the wise men.</end_of_turn>
And all this is because of the science of the mistress which is strong in that part where the child resembles the former, and therefore she must order that it be covered up so that it does not see it.
Chapter LXV
On the extraction of the foot when it is dead
When you cure the dead foot as we have said in the division of the medicine, and it is not expelled by force, and you must use an operation with care, considering whether the woman is of sound virtue and is not among those who are subject to the accidents for which she is feared to lose her life
Then you must cover the woman over the hips over the seat and lean her head back and lift her thighs.
And the minister has two parts or is bound in the hip for so that the body does not extend beyond the extraction of the foot
And then you moisten the mouth of the mistress with oil of olive and with a mixture of alum, fennel and seed of thyme.
And then put your hand on the mistress’s hand with those oils and mixtures, and then interlace your hand in the heel, where the nails remain in the foot.
And place conveniently where you consider that the foot is ready to come out, and when you have left the nails in the heel, or in the ankle, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or leave the beard, or the tonsils, or in the armpits, or in the places proper of the buttocks, or leave the fatness
If the pain extends to the toes or the middle of the back, it is also called gout.
And so keep the thumb with the left hand, and stop the curvature of the foot at the place between the thumb and the little finger of the left hand, and enter your hand there easily and stay there until the cause of the pain has passed away.</end_of_turn>
And so stay there and hold another hand there, or a third if necessary, to prevent it from being pulled too much, and not only in a straight line.</end_of_turn
And so be gentle all around, so that the sensation of the pain is relieved just as it is useful in the teeth when the cause of it is eradicated.</end_of_turn>
And so it is necessary that the extension is softened there; and if any part of it is retained, the lady should put some of her fingers on their tips with oil and enter there and rotate them over those that are retained.</end_of_turn
Therefore if the part of the foot is outside, their fingers will be exchanged among the places that are more painful; and do this until the whole foot is outside.</end_of_turn>
If the hand is outside before the other, and it is not possible to reduce that because of the stiffness of the foot, then cover it with a bandage; and extract that until the whole foot is outside, and insert that under the nail or at the junction of the thumb or at the ankle.</end_of_turn>
And so do the same with the other hand and the two feet.</end_of_turn>
If the head of the foot is large, or if it has been injured by the stiffness in the sensation, or if there is water adjusted in the head, then enter between the spines and split the head and extract the water, or drain it with an instrument called an “alundat”, which is of the same shape as the other instruments in the chest.</end_of_turn
And do the same if the foot is large by nature: and so insert that into the paste, or prevent that from being inserted as we have said; and extract the bones with forceps.</end_of_turn
And if the head is outside and is contracted behind the heel, then split it open until the humidity which is in the feet has disappeared.</end_of_turn
And if it is not complicated, or does not obey this sensation, then insert your finger as much as possible into the head.</end_of_turn
If the belly is swollen or is in hydrops, then extract that until the humidity which is in it is expelled.</end_of_turn
If the foot is over the knees, the attraction of the foot is slight and the direction of the foot towards the mouth of the uterus is slight.</end_of_turn
If it is contracted behind the belly and the foot, then extract that which has enveloped your hand, and split the belly and the foot until the water which is in them has drained out.</end_of_turn
If the other limbs are remaining and the head is back, the maid enters the left hand; if the mouth of the uterus is open, the maid puts the hand into the navel, grasps the head, and pulls that towards the belly, and at the same time enter one or two fingers into it and pull them out.</end_of_turn
And if the mouth of the uterus is closed by a swelling caused by an ulcer, do not stretch over it; just give an effusion of fatty humors.</end_of_turn Give compresses; and keep the patient in lukewarm water that mollifies and hydrates.</end_of_turn
And if the foot is over the knee joint, it is possible to do an agglutination: and to administer what has been said about the foot alive.</end_of_turn
And if that is not possible, then insert it under the nails, and extract it.</end_of_turn
And do not neglect any cause of the second kind.</end_of_turn>
When you have completed all your work, then administer what has been said about the cure for the ulcers which occur in the uterus.</end_of_turn
And if there is an influx of urine, discharge in astringent waters and administer the other treatment.</end_of_turn
E yeu ja e vist una femna en le ventre de la qual era fet mort, e aprop sobre aquel foc autra veguada emprenhada, e aprop foc mort es le fet autre. Accidit al u aprop lonc temps apostema in le sieu embelic; e inflat es entro que foc ubert, e comensec a getar brac.

Forma de impellent am le qual es empellit le fet:

And it is like a pair of forceps to which teeth are fastened at the extremity, thus as often as necessary, and some veins are made to flow long thus as often as necessary, to which teeth are fastened thus as often as necessary, like teeth that are fastened to a cushion to which is applied pressure. Form of slight swelling:
Form of a single swelling having a spine:
Form of a single swelling having two spines:
Form of swelling having two extremities to which the head is incisited:
Form of two wide swellings:
All these instruments are exercises, and when more of them are multiplied and prepared, the artificer must be more skilled, as it is more pleasant for the patient and more honorable for the doctor.
And do not work with these instruments in any way, for their necessity is not excusable.
From the extraction of the second [tooth].
When the second [tooth] is retained, you must encourage it, so that the patient will expel the seed itself, and then command her to spit with condiment, and grasp her hand over her mouth and over her nose, and if by this means it is ejected, well and good
And if not, take an elixir and perforate the covering with a needle and place on that herb that has opened the mouth of the woman, thus as with cinnamon and rue and marjoram and chamomile and saffron and mastic and cassia lignea and Saint-John's-wort All these herbs or some of them will be submerged in water in the elixir, and place that over the fire.
And put a canula of gutta in the mouth of the woman, and keep that inside until the vapor comes out to the cavity of the woman
And do that spit as we have said, and the second will be expelled with speed.
More if you remain with this care and it does not come out, then command the matron to submerge her left hand in olive oil or in almond milk, and then mix that in the palm of the hand and touch with that the second [tooth], and when that has been found, then take hold of it and pull that slowly, for if the tooth is attached to the jaw, take hold of the hand as we have recommended, and when you have found the second tooth, extract that little by little according to the rule so that the jaw is not left with the sharp impression. Then cover that the right and left sides are at ease and without pain.
And if the mouth of the woman is closed, as we have recommended, the care with the turning and the elixir with herbs
More if it does not come out by all the means we have recommended, then keep that you do not tire yourself out in the attempt of extraction, more however that what comes out of it to the mouth of the woman lies to the shame of the patient, and therefore order that that be praised with ointment and tetracycline; for that will make it disappear in a few days and will be expelled without fail.
More when it becomes pale, there is a bad odor to the head and the stomach, and that leads to the patient; and therefore it is necessary that sub-fumiguous and convenient remedies be administered at that time.
More of the ancients already use sub-fumigation with lead and dried figs
Form of an instrument with which the woman is sub-fumigated must be due to the retention of menstruation and the second [tooth].
Either see or be aware.
And keep the small limb in the palm of the hand and the large limb over the fire, and the sub-fumigation over the sleeves of the fire.
And keep that inside until that sub-fumigation is consumed and repeat it again
Care of the buttocks of the unperforated child.
The children cry out and their buttocks are not perforated, which already cause pain and swelling in the palm of the hand The matron should be covered with a cushion while the doctor pierces the heel of the foot; and if so, pierce that same heel with a pointed instrument, taking care not to touch the nerve.
And immediately place your hand over the area affected by the swelling in wine and oil; and take care that the point is numb before proceeding further
If you fear that it is swollen, then immediately insert a tube through the wound for several days, and leave it until the swelling has subsided
If it is necessary to consolidate the buttocks for the treatment of plague or swelling, then cover that consolidation so that it is not injured, and take care of it as has been said concerning treatment and ointment
Treatment for fistula that arise from the bowels.
Fistulas that arise in the lower parts of the bowels are nodular and bulky, and arise from the large intestine or the space between the buttocks
It is a fistula or swelling
And when that nodulus is old and softened by the moist white or pale yellow moisture, and several herbs penetrate some of those fistulas, several penetrate.
And those that penetrate are known for their evacuation by vomiting and by flatulence; and several women use the patient's vomiting to evacuate them, and many times it is evacuated by those very worms
And some of those fistulas penetrate into the bladder, and into the meat of the heel; and some penetrate into the space between the thighs and into the groin
And it is known that a penetrating fistula that enters the buttocks is not painful, and that when it does not penetrate, it is with difficulty that it can be recognized or grasped in the fistula when it is painful.
If it is painful, then immediately enter and try to grasp the point with ointment or with a sponge, until you feel the point or the swelling in the buttocks
And if neither of these methods succeed in producing vomiting or worms or flatulence, as we have said, then it is known that it is not a penetrating fistula, and you should take care of the treatment
And when the fistula penetrates the bladder or the heel bone, it is significant of urine from that source and the prohibition of its evacuation until such time as the place is healed by medical treatment
If it penetrates the hip joint or the bone and causes pain in the limb, it is a sign that the point has penetrated here if not painful in the bone, and that there is pain in the limb; and that it is necessary to reduce the swelling in all these cases; and that it is not valid in this treatment, nor is it consolidated at once
And in all these penetrating fistulas, treatment is not enough, and the treatment of these is the toil and care of the doctors who have been ordered to do so
And in the one that is not penetrating and is not old, healing with iron is expected as I have recommended and as I have done previously
And it is that the patient lies between his thighs and raises his legs up to his chest, the thighs are inclined towards his belly, and immediately enter with a sponge or ointment if there is swelling in the fistula, until you feel that the point has gone numb
If the patient groans from the pain in the buttocks, then immediately put your hand on the patient's buttocks
And if you feel the point has already penetrated without your having discovered it, or if you feel between the buttocks and the heel or the thigh, then it is undoubtedly that it has penetrated; and do not attempt anything in this case, for it is not in this treatment
Indeed, sometimes a healthy person is also affected by these matters.
And as for the medication for which we hope to provide some help in this matter, it is that you burn the cautery sponge with the width of the fistula, as has been said before, and introduce that burn into the fistula until it reaches the buttocks; and immediately repeat this two or three times until you are sure that all the affected tissues of the fistula have been cauterized, which resemble little feathers of geese
And take care of those who are wrapped in cloth so that they do not swell, and take care of those medicines that are generated and consolidate, and if it is healed, it is not; and if not, it is not healed at any other time by any other treatment
If the attempt enters and does not penetrate the belly of the thing that is in the groin, and between that and the attempt that is very clearly of marrow or cartilage, and sometimes the fistula in which the surface of the coccyx is cut, then dry the coccyx from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it dry on the attempt, and both in the fistula and outside it until the incision reaches the place where the extremity of the attempt is, and for the attempt is freed and cut.
And so ligate those carns that are fistulaed, which are put together like nails of pain and do not remain from any cause.
Maybe sometimes blood flows between you and your operation when you burn those carns, then it is better to cauterize with fire or acute medicine, because the cautery with fire is better for large wounds: so is the adjustion of those carns that are adjusted, and excision of the blood exseccated of the humors.
And so care for those that are clad in cloth in border or in cause of distress within that place escapes the hand, and so care for the wound as long as there is a hard, engorged bone generating and consolidating
And so medicines in which there is styptic action and excision; when the time has passed, it is already healed and you do not fear repetition.
However if the fistula has already passed into the belly of the groin and is elongated from its surface of the body, then enter the belly of the thing that is in the groin and inquire about that.</end_of_turn>
And therefore if you encounter the attempt and between you and her is clearly of cartilage or bone, and it is probable that it will penetrate, then it is not an operation in her but according to the way of faith and hope.</end_of_turn>
Which cause is to administer in her in three ways: or that you cauterize that again as we have said; or that you drain that until you perceive the concavity of her so that it is possible for you to enter with some instruments and the cure be more effective; and do not proceed without slicing so that you do not injure the skin containing the bone, and that you take care of the patient as soon as possible, even if it is with the will of the sick; or that you lengthen that clearly and say that pus that you dry up that within towards the groin, as we have said, or with the attempt or another acute instrument, and so ligate those carns that are fistulaed that are in the incision towards the end; and so force you to restore the entire wound from the incision, and if the pus that comes out does not consolidate, and the fistula remains open in the groin, and if there is still pus in the wound, you will be more curious about the patient.</end_of_turn> And sometimes the fistula is finished in this way: when you enter the attempt into the fistula, and it is at the flank of the groin surrounding the surface of the body with the coccyx and the margin of the groin, then the attempt tries to perforate the extremity, which is as if you were preparing the layers according to this method.
and enter in that faithful covering of hair or around those; and so enter the attempt with faith in the fistula until you perceive the concavity of her.
However if it penetrates the margin of the groin properly do not tighten, then you will extract from that thread that tract as soon as you enter the belly of the thing that is in the groin; and you will extract the extremity of the thread and adjust the two extremities even, and close each one, and rest for a day or two, and when it has subsided again insert the thread into the bone, close that again until those carns are inserted between two extremities of the thread and that they press together.</end_of_turn
And so care for the wound until it is consolidated and healed.</end_of_turn>
However if the sign of the fistula is not penetrating, then you must make it penetrate in whatever way you are prepared, but not in the belly, for that is not your concern, because you must not injure the skin; and so make that it is healed.</end_of_turn
The way of spatum spinos concerning which the fistula is fissured: the curvature of which is not acute and the other part is not blunt, so that you must not injure anything that is not necessary, even as sometimes.</end_of_turn
Of suture of hemorrhoids in which runs blood in the incision of those.</end_of_turn
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, which either remain between the groin like those that are of cartilage, or which are like the seeds of barley.</end_of_turn And of those there are small and large ones, and that the blood runs from those of all those towards that one, and it is neither solid nor liquid, but rather like a paste, and that is outside the groin and in the extremities of it.</end_of_turn
Mays empero aquelas que so foro le cul so segon las mes de pauca humiditat, de las quals corr aygua citrina o un petit de sanc am cos continuabla, e so segon la color del cos.
And the treatment for that is to order the patient to drink and expel until the urine becomes clear and the spots disappear from your eyes. Then you wipe and suspend with a handkerchief or that you have those on your nails, and then you prick those with your needle.
If your nails do not hold up due to the humidity of them and their softening, then take them with rough or coarse or flaked lanolin, and extract them from the nails, and then prick them with your needle, and sprinkle over them some fine ashes as a protection, because they will adhere to these rather than to the wound; or cauterize them as it is described in the chapter on cautery And take care of them with other treatments until they are healed
And if the urine does not obey evacuation, then order the patient to drink plenty of water in the bladder and that it be evacuated willingly when the patient expels it
If the spots are outside the urine, then their cause is slight, that is to say that you take those on your nails, or that you take those on your thumb, and instill them, and take care of them with water as we have said until they are healed.
And whoever has a wound, cover that you administer sutures according to this manner: take a silk thread and put it through a needle and then extract the spots from the upper parts, and make that penetrate through the needle in the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the part left behind the needle, and so horizontally; and tighten the wound firmly, and then remove the needle.
Do all of this, and do not touch them, so that the surplus of the healing runs from there
And put a little oil of rosemary or cerate on the bladder; and put that on the bladder and order the patient to rest. And leave that for a while; and when it is evening, care for them with ointment or another treatment until they are healed
And since these are ancient remedies and do not work in this medicine, cover those at the point of emission or on your nail until they are moist and host those pus pockets, which prevent them from solidifying; and take care of them until they are solidified.</start_of_turn
Then you must apply those with greater force than the first time until the wound is healed and is excoriated; and take care of them until they are healed.</start_of_turn
Know that the swelling of the limbs is key, and it is not without noticing red according to the color of the urine resembling a cap of clove, and it is useful in all parts of the body and especially in the lower parts of the feet and the buttocks, and because of these pains you must administer it.</start_of_turn
And then cover that which is in the circumference of the key, and keep it with nails or thumb, and eradicate it from its root; and take care of that.</start_of_turn
Or if you wish, cauterize them as it is described in the preceding chapter.</start_of_turn
But a verucca is a small, rough, round blister that appears on the surface of the body, and veins become swollen in the most of children.</start_of_turn
The treatment for them is to stretch and instill that, or to tighten that with thread or hair until evening.</start_of_turn Or if you wish, cauterize them as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.</start_of_turn
But a termite is a small, foul-smelling or large blister that appears on the surface of the body, and when it is touched again it is perceived as a bite of a termite, and is useful around the body.</start_of_turn

The causes of sudden vomiting are various: from the rupture of a bladder or stone, incision of the space or ribcage, percussion on the flank, or from a burst or arrow wound, or similar to these latter causes.
The boils that are on the limbs are just like boils that occur on the head, or on the buttocks, or on the feet, or on the belly, or on the testicles, or similar to these latter.
I also recommend the treatment of several boils to stop that reasoning and rule regarding the other boils
And I begin with the simple boils, for the memory of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when there is a simple boil on the head and it is not a fracture, it is considered: if it is due to the bursting of a bladder or something similar, and if the codena has already been taken alone and the boil is great and there is fear of apostemata of the head, then you must immediately cover the area with a cautery and evacuate the abscess as much as possible; and extract according to the quantity of the virtue of the herb if no other cause forbids it, more so if the abscess that is ejected is little.
And let the evacuation be contrary to the part affected by the boil; and guard the patient from repletion and from drink and coarse food
And if from the little the cause forbids it, then let the diet be reduced and do not approach meat or drink.</start_of_turn>
And rest over the boil, if there is an abscess of the cautery, smear with olive oil or in wine in which it is stipticated.</start_of_turn>
And if you are sure of the abscess of the cautery, then rest over the boil, if it is recent and the air has not changed that powder which I recommend to apply in small quantity.</start_of_turn
And if the air has already changed that, then rest over the poultice until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And if the boil is great or is due to an incision of the space or something similar, and the edges of the wound are not adjusted for pupils, then adjust them with a suture as I recommend for the suture of them.</start_of_turn
And if the boil is already discovered from the bone and skin, and it is not retention but a small swelling, then prick it and apply medicines to the boil; restore the meat immediately after the codena, and command the patient to abstain from eating fatty foods: heads and fat meats and things that resemble them, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if you find putrefaction in the codena and it does not adhere to the bone, then you prick everything that can be pricked and evacuate it, and apply treatment to it.</start_of_turn
And if in these boils there is an artery or vein from which blood flows, and which is not divided by medicines, then inquire about the artery; and if you find that it is not divided, then prick it with a needle, or ligate it; and if necessary you must cause that which we have said must not be eaten to be eaten, then cauterize it until the blood is divided.</start_of_turn
And if these boils are simple and small, the cause of them is slight; in this case that you sprinkle upon them this powder, which, when solidified, will dry out those that have changed with the air.</start_of_turn
And the manner of the powder is as follows: take olive oil one part, of blood-resin two parts, of vinegar not extinct three parts; mix them all together and grind them, and let the boil be filled with it, and let it be tightly bound by a good constriction until it adheres, and let it be coagulated with the blood.</start_of_turn
And apply those things with powder and read that, and do not remove it while it is still fresh, because it is not erased by the medicine until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And every vomit does only cause heat, when it is not at your presence oil and blood-resin.</start_of_turn
And this remedy has already been performed in great boils when it is necessary to suspend them on those and stretch them, and only for recent boils that have not altered their color.</start_of_turn
And if they have altered it, and especially when it is in summer, I do not understand the position of this powder, however, treat them with what we have said, in this way that you suspend the boils on the dressings or that you place them over the barley flour with water and honey until they are reduced; and apply the other treatment along with this until they are healed.</start_of_turn
May it be that if an accident occurs at the fracture of bones, even if it is slight, then you extract what is in the hand.
And I say that the cure for fractures of the head is in that which is venomous.
Of the plagues of the bowels.
May it be that if the plague occurs in the bowels, it is no different in medication, and between the plague of the head when it is simple.
May it be that if the nerves of the bowels are cut or an artery, if it is a nerve, it is not in its skill but that it should be avoided care of it at that which makes violent stiffness, just as if with vinegar and eggs which is old and appears like that which does not knot the nerves and relaxes against that which does And do not stop about any cause of all heat, for the substance of the nerves is hot and the continuation of them is at the brain, which is the most important of all the members
And if it must be cured with medicines that are lighter, just as it is caused by washing with lukewarm water, any vegetable smeared in olive oil or not-olive oil, and it is to be washed with lukewarm water and the other parts to be drained in this manner, and to apply heat.
May it be that if the plague is great, then administer suture, or ligate the edges of it, and apply care to that which is inside until it is healed.
May it be that if the plague is depth or has occurred at the lower part, then perforate that in the place where it is most depressed
May it be that if in the plague an artery has already been cut and there is obtained a flow of healing, then separate or dry that, or ligate that, or cauterize that if necessary for that which you cause to it
May it be that if already the vertebrae of the thigh or all, and the veins of the bowels have been cut, then you adjust the edges of the thigh over the bone of the thigh and do not touch that; keep that equal and reduce that to its natural figure, and strengthen that which is stretched downwards, and let that rest for some days; and care for that which is inflamed in which there is stiffness and excitement until it is healed.
May it be that if the plague has already made its mark on the bone in price, then pierce that, and if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them; and what is not affected, let that rest until the plague has subsided, and be separate and the evacuation of it be relieved.
And if the plague is recent, then sprinkle over that powder which has been recommended to you May it be that if in the plague there is a fistula, then care for that as regards that from which the memory will come soon in the seat of the head.
If it is percussion of the groin or the heel, and sometimes of the depth, then consider more if the patient has fever than the disease itself; for the plague is mortal.
And if it is not of depth and the plague is recent at the seat of the healing, then you stop in it for the first hour and sprinkle, and do not strengthen that because it should not be retained in the depth of it and return to the heart and augment the disease, but stop in it attracted, and take away two vegetables that give.
And if the tongue is not present, then you stop in the orifice of the plague close to old age because of that which arises from the humilities; and make the patient sleep over the plague so that run off what is in it adjusted.
May it be that if already three days or more have passed from the plague and the patient does not have spasmodic fits or convulsions of the heart or stiffness of the belly, and sometimes the other good symptoms of him, then it is to be believed that the plague is saved; and then care for that as regards warm clothes and the other care until it is healed
May it be that if the healing is excused, and the time has already passed, then it is to be believed that the fistula has already been made; care for that therefore for the head
And if the plague is for incision of space or heel, and is simple on the surface of the foot or thigh, then care for that as regards the powder which precedes suture, if it is great, or as regards the powder, if it is small.
May it be that if already there has been a fracture in the bone, and so already of them has been cut, then you rotate the plague and cover to extract those fragments, if they are separated May be if they are not separated, the hour will read less of what they actually suffer, for the extraction of these is alleviated.
And as for other plagues that happen in other members, their care is aided by what we have already said
From the belly plagues
The indisposition that happens in the belly is great, or little, or medium
And a slight rupture is a difficult thing for another method, and if you know that the reduction of them is more difficult, if you do not abstain from the intrusion of them in the chest cavity, it will open and become swollen because the substance of them is painful.
And therefore the better rupture is medium, because in that one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, just as it is difficult in the two preceding species.
And it is known that the suture of the belly is done in four ways, but two sutures are common that are customary in the sutures of the other plagues of the body
And two other sutures are specific that are common in other plagues, but in the suture of the belly they are more specific
And I recommend to you that you show any exposure and declaration
Therefore I say that when the plague is slight and there is any cause of the intestine for that, and it is difficult to reduce that, the hour is in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine is inflamed by the cold of the air.
Therefore when it is thus, the hour commands that you cover that area with a sponge soaked in warm water, or that you grasp with water squinant, and cypress, and pepper, and cloves until the inflammation is resolved
Some veins cause that which has styptic, and it is better that only water alone in resolving the inflammation
Therefore when the inflammation is resolved, the hour moistens the intestine with water in which it is covered with salt and flowers, because by that the substance of them is alleviated for little cause.
But if the substance of them is excused nearby this care, the hour will split the rupture with a small instrument that has pierced wounds.
The first care is better when it is immediate that it is not excessive, and that it is not an occupation to dry that which is not necessary and detrimental
Of the instrument, if its form is such that:
One part is acute, and the other is not acute, and the blunt extremity, and not like the sharpness of a sponge, be neither obtuse nor acute but slightly rounded
Therefore when the plague is amplified and is outside the intestine, the hour commands that its reduction be according to its natural form, in the proper cavity, if possible over water, because it is better
But when the rupture is wide and is in the lower part of the belly, the hour commands that you place the patient on the two thighs and suspend your steps more numerous than usual; and if it is in the higher part of the belly, the hour commands that you suspend your hand and the feet more numerous than the other parts
Similarly if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, the hour suspends your understanding and your consideration for a moment so that the part in which the plague is located is higher than the other
And thus command that you administer water in the great plagues and in the medium plagues.
And in the small plagues, suspend water that is to your preparation, and order that it be administered between your greatest pains, which has the whole rupture in its hand and adjusts the lips of it, and order to uncover from this to that that if there is any cause of any suture to be made another.
And this is the common suture technique: that you grasp the needle, or companion of the needle according to the quantity of the amplitude of the plague; and that you lay aside the extremity of the disruption of the ring finger, and tighten the needle one, or more than one that you do not put faith in the two extremities of the codena, at the two extremities of the cipa which is left by the codena of the parts that are detached, until you have pierced that part; and you have already added two extremities of the codena and two extremities of the cipa, and so there are four orders in total.
And thus stretch the thumb firmly doubled at the root of the nail, and some veins are seen from two parts together, and add the two lips and the tongue together for collection downwards; and let the thickness of the toe rest and fix another nail in that place, and join that thumb firmly as before; and do not cease until the whole contraction of the tongue is complete.
And the fine needles shall move between the fat and the lean, for the fine needles do not pierce the flesh with much force; and the thick ones are difficult to handle in the flesh, and thus it is necessary that they should move in leanness and fatness.
And do not let the needle be held at two extremities of the flesh at once, for thus the flesh will not be pierced too violently and the wound will be closed before its consolidation.
And do not prolong the sutures for the wound is not to be hindered in its consolidation
And thus puncture the extremities of the needles so that they do not irritate the patient excessively; and stop over the suture fine particles expanded from every side, which have the extremities of the needles; and leave them in place until you know that the wound has already consolidated
These methods of stitching with needles in this way are more convenient in small wounds, because they require only one or two needles or to surround them
The second suture is more common: and it is that you administer the suture at four extremities, that is, the two extremities of the thigh and the two extremities of the heel, in one line, with a needle in which the thread is firmly enveloped in leanness and fatness
And thus when the needle has pierced these four extremities, reduce the needle from that middle part from which you began, so that the thread retracts somewhat from the wound, so that the suture is like the second suture mentioned above which is more firm
And pause between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the middle finger.
And this suture is sufficient for the men.<end_turn>
And in such a suture I cured a a man who had a wound in his belly which was affected by an injury to the greatest palm of his hand which was caused by a splinter, and it was the disruption of the greatest part of the wound over two palms of the thumb and was the disruption in the middle of the limb; and when I had reduced that after the thumb had been outside the wound for xxx hours.
And the wound was consolidated within fifteen days or thereabout, and I cured him of that and he is healthy; and thus it is known among the people.
And the other doctors had given up hope that he would not recover; and by a miracle, for I know of no other medicine, I cured him of that, because in that place there was neither wound nor any medicine, but I continued to change the dressing twice a day and to bathe him diligently with honey water until he recovered
And I say two special methods of stitching according to the narration of Paraula.
And you begin with the suture of the thigh, and enter the needle from the distal part to the proximal part.<end_turn>
And thus when the needle penetrates the thigh and in that middle lacerate according to the rule and in length throughout the body, and leave the heel where you have introduced the needle; and make penetrate in the other extremity the needle from the distal part to the proximal part in the other extremity of the limb.
And thus when you have finished that penetration, then make another penetration in that same extremity from the distal part to the proximal part; and leave the heel that is in that part, and make penetrate the needle in the other extremity from the distal part to the proximal part of the limb
And thus make penetrate in such a way that the former penetration that you made into the limb is in the middle of the latter two penetrations.
And thus begin from this middle side and go towards that extremity which is the heel in the other side, and extract the needle from the thigh which has penetrated, and reduce that in that thigh and close the heel which is in the other side to this extremity; and extract that from the thigh which is part of the limb.
And make one loop and another, and make one loop almost like another until you have closed all that is distal according to that example
The sum of this method of stitching is that you close with a suture of skin in which you join the skin, namely that you close the heel with a loop from the part of the extremity of the thigh, and that you leave the other loop until it is complete.
May the second kind of suture which you say with certainty is Gualia, and this is of such nature that your thing which you do in this way, like many doctors do in like manner, adds all parts to their appropriate parts; and apply the extremity of one of them to the extremity of the mirror to the other extremity of them, and that is done according to your recommendation.
Because you keep the needle at the mirror extremity at your command, and pass it through the depth in that hole, and draw out two extremities of the gut; then reverse the needle and make it penetrate from the hole to the gut in two extremities of the gut.
And then reverse those folds, and make penetrate whatever of the gut's parts that are within the hole into the hole in two extremities of the mirror other than those on the contrary side
And this way of stitching is better than the common light stitching, and is a stitching of which there is precedent to remember
This is the term of Gualia
And I say to you again, the belly stitching is rectified with two needles, so that you enter into these with every thread, and begin with the inside needle of that which is due to you, and make that penetrate into the other side according to the stitching of those which do the body well.
And you know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, the hour of stitching it is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
More pleasant is the judgement of the plague than the judgement of the other plagues.
The cause of which is that when you become conscious of the recent plague in the summer that the air alters that, and reduce the gut and do those things and apply them properly, then stop over that dusty sediment
And if the air has already altered the plague, then stop over that until those which are present enter into your presence until they make a hard stone and bring tears, and consolidate the gut and the mirror; and then care for that just as for the care of the other plagues until it is healthy
And if you are not present with the medicines, then stop over that so much, because it begins to vomit bile, old blood, and change those two meals that you give, just as you have been taught, until it is healthy, for you do not digest another medicine in great quantities when the plagues are simple.
And if you fear that the plague communicates with lesions to the principal members, then cover that you immerse linen soaked in olive oil of quality, or in scented olive oil, and stop that in the circuit of the places that are between the armpits and leave the veins open.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in the belly buttons, that many meals have been omitted, then cry out that black wine be given to you, and more so if the putrefaction has reached the gut and is well-penetrated into the cavity.
And you know that that which is of the great belly is more readily healed than that which is in the small belly
And it is a difficult healing because the belly which is called “gegunu” does not receive the healing of the plague that fills it in its entirety; and that is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and for the magnitude of it that is in those, and for the subtility of the body of that, and for its proximity to nature.
And if what proceeds from the plague is the cloth, and you have that recent, reduce that according to your custom that you reduce the guts well
And if it has passed to the space and has already become green or black, then strengthen that thread that you have over the place that is detested by it, so that there comes out a flow of health, for in the cloth there are veins and arteries.
And then say that another that is another ligament, and stop two extremities of the thread pending the part from which the plague has been expelled so that over you there is relieved the attraction of it because of the removal of the cloth and the emission of the bile of the plague
Memories of the plagues when they happen in the gut.
When disruption occurs in the belly and it is slight, it is possible that it may be cured in a short time, for to help that you may see that which was placed sick in the lower belly with percussion of the hand and was the plague of the lower part of the stomach, and the plague was old and well-formed, and there was fistula, and egestion of it with vomiting and diarrhea
And so I follow the treatment of them already that it was not confident in the healing of them, but I cease to subtiliate that until the body is healthy and the place is consolidated
And I say that when the area is already consolidated, time has passed over the patient's illness which happened by chance in their belly; and let them not be troubled by anything that happened by chance and remain in their beds eating and drinking, and I order that they be bathed and exercised in these things.
And I say that some experienced people say that when the plague comes upon the belly and is small, it is necessary to bind it in this way: take large sponges; and adjust the two lips of the plague and place a sponge over those that cover the mouth over the two lips of the plague; therefore, when you take hold of those and stretch your mouth, cut off the head of the plague, which adheres and is not dissolved.</end_of_turn>
And place another sponge upon the first one, and do not cease until you have put on another sponge according to the quantity of the entire plague.</end_of_turn>
And reduce that and keep the plague contained; and leave those heads attached in the belly until the belly is healed; and do not do anything to the patient at night.</end_of_turn
And it is possible that the belly is tied to the firm thread which is the belly of the beasts that are attached to it, because it is more flexible; and take hold of the extremity of these beasts' bellies, without tearing, and bind the extremity of it to the firm thread, covering it, and put that thread into needles and tie that up in the disruption.</end_of_turn
And this way of stitching with sponges is nothing but by faith and hope.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if the plague is great and wide, mostly if it is in one of the subtle bellies, which the hour does not know how to handle but with subtlety, and not with healing of it from all.</end_of_turn
Take care of wounds and fistula.</start_of_turn>
It is known that every plague and swelling diminishes when it grows old and becomes antique, and it is called a wound, and is not consolidated and is not broken off, the hour that in any member it is, it is universally called fistula and is called that swelling.</end_of_turn
And fistula according to truth is recognized foul, hard, white with which there is no pain and which is flattened like the swelling of a wound of an ass; and for this reason it is named that wound, that is, ass.</end_of_turn
And it is in a wound that the humors become wet, which breaks; and when the humidity is strong, it is broken in a few hours.</start_of_turn And many herbs this humidity move, and it is little, and is great, and is subtle.</start_of_turn
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of them and their treatment with medicines in the division.</start_of_turn
And I tell you that I make known the treatment of fistula which is useful by the way of surgery with the hand.</start_of_turn
And you know that fistula can happen in all parts of the body; that of those are fistulas that go to the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the spleen, or the belly, or the bladder, or any of the vertebrae, or any of the compound joints like that of the hand and foot; and of those that are close to the main limb and resemble them.</start_of_turn
Therefore, that fistula which is treated in this way is one of the diseases of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and is occupied with work and ignorance.</start_of_turn
And if it is of any fistula the depth of which does not reach these places that I have said, and you hope and trust in the treatment of it, and you wish to come to know it, when you attempt to remove or cut, and if the fistula goes according to rule, ask for it.</start_of_turn
Maybe if the fistula is tortuous, however, when you attempt to grasp it with your hand, because the air of the belly is alleviated and curved due to the tortuousness.</start_of_turn
If the fistula is not horribly painful, it is not within your power to determine its cause.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.

And thus the doctor must take charge of many patients at the same time, and do not linger over them, for I was called away.
And behold the condition of the patient, with the running of matter from their wounds for great pain; and already the colour of that man was pale and yellow
And thus I introduced the thumb into one of those wounds and grasped the thumb to the bone
Then I saw and inspected all the wounds and found them to be open from all parts of the wound
And thus I covered myself and incsed one of those wounds until I scraped off a piece of the bone, and I stopped that corruption, for it was already dead and rotten, and there was already corruption in the limb until I had penetrated into the marrow
And thus I did what was prescribed to me and prepared by the bone exposed
And I say that it is not in the bone but that corruption which I scraped off and which I held, and I had already extracted it.
Then I stopped the restoration of the plague with long-term medicine, and it is not consolidated
And thus I repeated the process and discovered it once more concerning the primary discovery, and I stopped the continuing corruption of the bone.
And I say that from that corruption I saw that it must be treated, and I make the cure and restoration, and it is not restored
And thus I found it again in another way and I did not stop incuding the small parts little by little until I perforated the restoration of the limb, and it is not restored until I have included almost the whole of it, and I extract the marrow from the middle, and I restore it with medicine, and it is consolidated and healthy
And it is not necessary to repeat the operation of the limb and its section, but for the care of the freulence of the limb and for the scarcity of its tolerance and fear of its death, which it undergoes at all hours by excessive evacuation without any bad evacuation
Therefore health is for the entire healing, and nothing is more useful than the care of the limb in its place; and it is good to restore the virtue of the limb; and it is preserved in its care and is not hindered in its walking or at any time in any matter.
But if it is on the bone of the limb already fractured, the hours that you must follow this manner: that you take a ligament and stretch it at the extremity of that bone, and command someone to extend that in its entirety; and suspend that ligament of wool more thick than the first ligament; and then place that over the bone which you leave behind the bone that you are closing, and extend the limb so that you draw the bone to the parts beyond, and you uncover the bone over the place where you wish to close it so that the wound does not damage the bone
And suspend it firmly or put a board behind the bone adequately, because when you do that the wound is not prohibited from cutting the corrupted bone
And cover that the closing is made little by little, because if it is in the hollow of the bone the corruption will not appear in its appearance to the feeling, and forces the closing of the other way.
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, advance one part continuously with the other, and the corruption is in the middle or part of it, the hours you uncover the bone entirely; and suspend firmly from both sides, and close that from which the corruption is absent until the closing of the other part is completed
And the closing must be according to the location of the corruption a little, as we have said<end_turn>
And if the corruption is in the articulation, incisions that corrupted articulation, and close the bone from which the continuation is made of the other part<end_turn>
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two articulations, the hours are not in their ratio but are cunning<end_turn>
And if the corruption is in the wrist or ankle, it is not easy; however cover that you inquire about the corruption in what manner it appears to you, and open that, and manage that according to any rule that is possible to you, and in case of doubt make it rectifiable to you, when it does not make your veins or nerves contradict<end_turn>
And you must know what is incisions and what instruments to use for incisions of these bones are not according to the situation of the bones, and the preparation of those, and the size of those, and the thinness and greatness and smallness of those, and the hardness and rarity of those; for that you must prepare for every kind of operation the appropriate instrument for that operation.
You know that this operation implies great skill on your part concerning the instrument which you will employ; for it demands great study, long experience, and knowledge of the methods of this art, as well as experience in the treatment of diseases, which is convenient for all ailments.
And so I inform you at the end of this chapter concerning the names of the instruments which you will employ; for with these which you will proceed according to your prohibition, which you will experience upon other occasions. It is not clear what you mean by "forma de serra". Please provide more context or rephrase the sentence
It is not clear what you mean by "forma de otra serra". Please provide more context or rephrase the sentence
It is not clear what you mean by "forma de otra serra gran". Please provide more context or rephrase the sentence
It is not clear what you mean by "forma de ray". Please provide more context or rephrase the sentence Both the head and points of this ray are shaped like the star-studded sky, and the points are similar to those of the astrophysicists.
It is not advisable that the heads of the joints be fractured when they are corrupted, or that the large mouth be widely open
The smaller razor-like shape
The flat razor-like shape
The other razor-like shape is appropriately made: the arch is broad and the edge is keen, and the body of the instrument is struck downward in a puncture fashion The shape of it
The shape of the razor in which there is a concave area
The other subtle razor-like shape
The shape of another razor with curved extremities
The shape of a small razor resembling a tentacle
The shape of another smaller incisor
The shape of another incisor; this resembles a ray, and the end of it is like a saw, and it is exhibited in various locations in proportion to the bones
The shape of a ray which is appropriate for the perforation of bones:
And its end is triangular and acute-tipped
It is made of Indian steel, and is similar to all the causes we have mentioned concerning razors, scissors and saws
For the incision of the extremities and the cutting of bones.
The extremities are sometimes painful either by an intrinsic cause or an extrinsic one, or as you have treated that corruption for the care of those medicines and the care does not relieve it, or sometimes the corruption goes away from the limb without you having treated it, when in such a case you must incision that limb in order that the pain may cease before the corruption becomes more serious or deadly than the limb itself.
A sign that this must be done is that the limb becomes black before it is healed, or that the blackness approaches closely before the putrefaction of that part of the limb itself has disappeared; therefore you must immediately incision that limb in order to prevent it
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the percussion of various venomous causes such as a scorpion of the sea, or a fox, or a bite of a viper or anything similar
If the corruption or percussion is in the extremity of the finger, then you must incision the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand
Similarly, if the corruption affects the wrist, then you must incision at the root of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it has consumed the forearm itself
And if you should see that, then you must incision the forearm within the elbow joint
If this happens again, and sometimes even when the elbow is involved, the death of the disease is in that case; and to administer another cause along with the treatment is in this case nothing more than a useless effort.
Similarly, if the corruption affects the foot when it concerns the great toe, then you must incision that within one of the bones
If it comes to the nail of the foot, then you must make an incision over the whole foot. If it comes to the nail of the foot, then you must make an incision through the skin to the joint of the nail
And if the corruption has already spread over the nail, then it is not useful to do anything but let it die, and leave the patient to his fate.</start_of_turn>
The way to cut or pierce the limb is that you grasp the ligament behind the place where you wish to pierce, and grasp another ligament over the bone; extend the minister one ligament towards the sides, and extend the minister another ligament on the other side; and you separate the flesh that is between two ligaments somewhat wide until the whole flesh is exposed; and then pierce or cut.</start_of_turn
And you must keep the hand away from the bone of all sides so that it does not touch the bone itself, and that the patient receives the wound adjusted and apply the cautery.</start_of_turn>
If blood flows freely when working, then you must cauterize the area cautiously, or stop the bleeding by pressing on it; and then return to your medication until it is completed.</start_of_turn
And then bind the affected limb with a ligament as desired, and care for him until he is healed.</start_of_turn
I urge you to send a man to the heel of the foot, this means that this accident is like adding fuel to the fire that was already there.</start_of_turn
And that corruption first of all appears in the heel of the foot until it affects the whole foot.</start_of_turn
Then that man should prepare himself for his fate more than by receiving the cure for the limb with the greatest care, and he will pierce that foot at the joint, and the foot will be healed.</start_of_turn
For a long time that malicious corruption stays in the nail of the hand indicates.</start_of_turn
And in my opinion, if you wish to understand this matter and overcome the uselessness that hangs over the hand of the physicians, then remove the uselessness from the body of the disease; and it will not be useless and will begin to go away from the hand as soon as it starts in the foot.</start_of_turn
I urge you to pierce the hand yourself, and I do not fear the repercussions of that uselessness, for I believe that it is better for the patient to die than for him to endure such a painful and useless treatment.</start_of_turn
When I am gone from you, return to your land and tell me that that man prepared himself and pierced his hand throughout, and that he is healed.</start_of_turn
I have told you this story only to make you understand what happens in this disease, and what is the reason for its significance.</start_of_turn
Beware of doctors who are lacking in skill and who practice medicine carelessly.</start_of_turn>
When a boil appears in a fleshy limb, the space of the boil is prolonged until it collects pus, and then it is ruptured and pierced, and the pus is expelled from it; the limb remains as before as if it were a vessel, and the surrounding tissue is as if it were finely ground, and there is no further corruption, and it does not imprint on the bone or nerves or ligaments, it is simply pus, and it is not named fistula.</start_of_turn
However, if the space is prolonged until the corruption spreads to some limb, then it is called a fistula and does not stop.</start_of_turn
The treatment for this is to lance that wound throughout as if it were a wound, especially when it is fine and is beneficial like mucus, and comfort yourself that it does not adhere to the bone due to its corruption.</start_of_turn
However, if you hope that the wound will adhere and that the corruption will not cause any further harm, and the wound has spread to the face, then treat that as if it were a boil.</start_of_turn
And you must consider the nature of the wound, and if it is large, and the limb which has become foul-smelling, then treat that with an Egyptian medicine which is made from olive oil, vinegar and mustard seeds, and which is applied to the wound in a vessel, and covered with a cloth until the medicine has finished working and has achieved its purpose.</start_of_turn
And take from it what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; and cleanse with that the wound, strengthen its edges, and leave the medicine on for two hours.</start_of_turn
And immediately extract that which is causing the pain; and do so until the pain is gone and the swelling has subsided.
When these things are powdered with vinegar and water, except when this remedy is not at hand; then take the ashes of vinegar, and mix them with water; and do so until you confirm that the swelling has subsided.</end_of_turn>
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the vinegar water, then do the following: clusterize the foot with vinegar and honey and add sulfur three times, and clusterize the foot with wine and honey mixed, because honey has the property of softening and washing away, and the wine makes the swelling adhere to the bone, and especially when there is excess of stiffness and dryness.</end_of_turn>
And when you have made the foot cluster several times and you confirm that the swelling has subsided, then clusterize the foot with water that makes the flesh soft in it.</end_of_turn
And take a dose of diaphincum and dissolve it in olive oil and wine vinegar; or clusterize the foot with various medicines and add others that have the properties you have already read in the treatise on medicines.</end_of_turn>
And if the opening of the joint is tight in which the canula of the cluster is not received, then gradually enlarge that small opening, and keep it covered with gauze moistened with Egyptian or balsamic ointment until it is enlarged.</end_of_turn
Similarly, if the opening is wide, then suture the edges of the joint and leave the amount that is necessary for the cluster to be placed.</end_of_turn
And if the limb from which the pain originates is elevated to the upper parts, then dry that area below the limb that is under the joint so that the limb can run smoothly, because when the limb is constrained in the bend of the joint the flesh in that area is compressed.</end_of_turn
And if it is not possible for you to dry the joint outside the bone below as you wish, then you must tell the patient to prepare the limb with the preparation for which the limb should be flexed willingly according to your order and not to be retained by any cause of the limb.</end_of_turn
May whoever is on the joint, which you leave for an hour, so that the swelling that is adjusted in it is evacuated.</end_of_turn And so that you know if the swelling that comes from the limb is mobile or little, or is digested or undigested.</end_of_turn
And as for the location of the joint, if in it the patient feels pain or not, and if it is swollen.</end_of_turn
And when your medicine is prolonged in this way, and you see that the matter that is gathered over the joint has already adhered, or has proper adhesion, then you must remove it or take it away on the third day. And when you remove the dressing, change the bandage for another and renew the ointment.</end_of_turn
May there not be any subtle viruses remaining on the limb, because the healing of the joint is proper, because some people in whom the generation of flesh is delayed in the course of the wound, and in those in whom it is beneficial to the contrary.</end_of_turn
And if the limb has been swollen for several days and the limb is still undigested, then you must know that the joint does not adhere; and if the adhesion of the joint is delayed and is the cause of the prolongation, then you must adjust in the drying of the medicines, and if the medicines are humified in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry just like diaphincum when adjusted in excessive swelling.</end_of_turn
And it is more useful to take diaphincum and dissolve it in olive oil, and mix it with wine vinegar in its substance, and apply it to the area, and use it.</end_of_turn
And in that action, when not for the limb, take diaphincum, honey when it is cooked, and use them; or take myrrh and aloes and incense, crush them all and powder them over honey when it is lukewarm, and apply that over the bandage and strengthen that over the joint; and apply that until the honey has been cooked, and powder over the bandage and strengthen that.</end_of_turn
Every day these treatments are administered with long-term aristology and reason from celestial bodies (for it is a celestial body) and herbs and centaury, and use of these simples or adjusted, crush these and sprinkle over the wax which I have recommended; and then apply of it.
If the pain persists, and it is not healed by this treatment, it is necessary to know that the corruption is in the bowels, and already inquire in the bones or in the other members hard or flexible or to the ligaments; then treat it with fistula treatment, as it is said.
Treatment for panaritis and nails attracted and incision of the finger added and section.
Panaritis is a swelling that does not leave the nail of the finger or toe, and often occurs in the other fingers, and as it persists and its treatment is less effective, or if it is a swelling of a swelling, or if it is corrupted, and pus comes out from it until it consumes the root of the nail, and it is corrupted all the way to the bone, and it is foul-smelling, and the finger is deformed, and its color is pale yellow.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, when you see that which we have said in the division and you do not relieve your treatment, know that you must instill the whole surrounding area with a burning instrument to cauterize the wound and thus prevent further damage.
If the bone is soft and the nail is sound, and the nail has already become loose from the flesh, and it is already bursting and bleeding, know that you must leave the tip of the nail that is bursting the flesh alone, and put pressure on it and stab it with an instrument, and hold over it what remains of the flesh from the corrosive medicines until it is all absorbed; and then treat that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If the corruption has already spread to the bone, know that you must burn the bone and extract it, for it is never healthy for the bone to be corrupted.</end_of_turn>
And if sometimes the corruption and the infection go up to the finger, know that you must burn it in one of the nails as you deem, and then treat that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If the nail suffers percussion or swelling, and if there is violent pain, know that you must at the beginning apply cold compresses to the patient, and then dry the nail with a rough cloth and cut it across, and take care that the cut does not go deeper than the nail itself, for you will thereby cause the violent pain, and if the cut is too deep it will cause the surrounding tissue to swell; and treat that area with that which will relieve the pain.</end_of_turn
And thus it is said adjusted, which is natural in the most of households, is very tough because of the flesh, and is very tough in the bones, or is very tough in the nails.</end_of_turn>
And these are born from the root of the joint, or from the birth of them in the bones of the fingers.</end_of_turn And that which is born in the bones of the fingers does not hurt, but that which is born in the joints is painful.</end_of_turn
And as for those which are born fleshy, the cut is slight, and you must insert that which will remove the root with a blunt edge.</end_of_turn
And as for that which is born in the root of the joint, the treatment is difficult; and therefore take care of the amputation of it.</end_of_turn
And as for that which is born in the finger, you must at the beginning remove the surrounding flesh around the nail with a circular incision near the bone, and then hold with one of those convenient instruments, and treat that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And when consolidation has occurred in the fingers between their joints, either from the natural growth of the limb or from the birth of the fetus or from consolidation of pus or from burning of fire, or for any other reason, know that you must remove that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.</end_of_turn
And finally, leave space between their folds of skin covered in oil so that they do not adhere to each other, and separate between them, or put between them a layer of soft lead until it is consolidated as you deem.</end_of_turn
And in the same way, if consolidation occurs in the bones of the palm, know that you must dry that consolidation according to what is convenient and appropriate for the shape of the limb.</end_of_turn
From the cutting of veins, so are varicose veins.</end_of_turn
Veins are varicose veins, and these are veins which are swollen with thick blood which is full of melancholic matter, which are in the muscles of the limbs of the body, and their greatest progress is in the limbs of travelers and laborers and porters.</end_of_turn
Adonc cove que tu administres purguacio del cors de colera negra alcunas veguadas am expulcio fort, e aprop sangna le pacient de la vena basilica.
The cure for this is in two ways: one is that they be insensible and that the black bile be administered, and the other way is to elevate the vein and extract all of it.
The section of the thigh is carried out in this way: clamp the limb at the commencement with cold water until the large bile is resolved, which is beneficial for the limb; then stretch the limb of the patient at the part furthest from the navel towards the part of the knee with a bandage, and clamp the vein in one place or in two or in three at a wide section, and elevate the black bile to the upper part of the thigh towards the belly button, and withdraw it in urine until the quantity that you wish has been extracted, and that which will tolerate the virtue of the patient.
And so do these things, and command them to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
Repeat the treatment for phlegm until the veins are empty and until the patient is better
Therefore, the elevation of the limb is done in this way: you stretch the limb of the patient, if there is movement in it, and then bathe it and clamp the limb with cold water until it is stiff and the veins are relaxed; or that it be exercised by strong exercise, if there is no bath available, until the limb is flaccid
And so dry the cord in the root of the vein by section in the long or in the back of it must give it a blow, or in the buttock of it must do so.
And so close the cord with nails and draw out the vein throughout until it appears, and it is necessary to take notice of the sensation that sometimes accompanies this, which often descends to black.
Therefore, when you have finished and closed the cord, you must sometimes remove the white thread that remains.
And so you must put your hand away when it is elevated and grasped from the cord, and suspend it with an ointment of honey or balsam
And so do another incision nearby that section for three fingers, and then draw out the cord from the part below the vein until it appears
And so elevate that and cut that behind the second incision must give it a blow, and then extract that and elevate that until it is expelled by the second incision, and extract that from the incision above that
And do this until you have extracted that from the most distant incision or from all the incisions, until all is expelled; and then cut that
And if you do not obey my order to extract and elevate, then insert a strong needle twice and tie that, or insert your hand and grasp it all over until it is numb Beware that it is not pierced; for if it is broken, it is useful to your difficulty in elevating that and is harmful to the patient for that night.
And when all that is expelled, then pause over the place of the wound with a wet cloth soaked in wine and oil fragrant and unfragrant, and care for that until it is healed
And if the patient has suffered from contravents having swelling to which is related the covering of the parts, and it is not according to the rule as we have said, then you must cover the wound over all the parts of swelling and the places of covering, and suspend that with nails until that whole is raised up.
Beware that you must not pierce the vein and that you must not touch that, for it is difficult to elevate that; and use your prudence in this matter.
This section describes how to perform the incision correctly, but the translation is too long to be included here.
It is not urgent like nails nor is it acute at the extremities so that it does not pierce the vein; and it is of great flexibility like a lion, for if it were soft, it would pierce the vein by its softness; having in it excessive thickness as we have said
On the extraction of the vein of the thigh.
This vein is engendered in the limbs towards the lower parts just as in the land of the Arabs and in the Indian lands towards the lower and arid parts having little vegetation and in which there is no reed or tree.
The other limbs also suffer from similar pains.
Their swelling is caused by corruption which leaves the skin like that of a serpent bitten by worms and insects, and worms are engendered between the skin and the flesh
And the sign of the swelling caused by the coming of these worms is that the vein which is at the root of the inflammation becomes inflamed; then the area is swollen; and the vein begins to rise from the place of that swelling as if grazed by a plant
And thus when they appear at the extremity, then cover that part with a plum whose weight is equal to two drachs. Enter two drachs, and note that and leave the plum suspended from the limb.</end_of_turn>
And whenever there is a cause of this sort in any part of the body, cover with lead and do not remove that And if it is not prolonged, then prick a a part of it and cover with lead; do not prick that which is raw because if you prick that which is contracted it will enter the flesh and cause swelling and ulceration of the flesh in that place
So that it may be treated gently and be gradually extracted until it is expelled from behind the limb and does not remain in the body for any cause
And of this vein is said to be about five palms and a thumb in length and I believe that one of twenty palms is enough.
And if it is pricked at the time of treatment, then insert the needle into the body of the limb and perforate that for a long distance through the body until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer corruption of the area for a few days with medicines; and then care for the wound for the healing of ulcers
And this vein has various causes, and mostly when it appears at the ankle or in the foot, and it causes swelling there, and it is said to be of some ulcer or wound.
Therefore take care of it as we have said in the division and as we have said before
From the section above worms are generated under the skin and is called bovine gout.
This disease is called in every land bovine gout because it is not seen in other animals except in men and it appears in all parts of the body, from the head to the feet, and is known by the feeling of pain in every member until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is from the corruption of some humors as well as from the bite of worms and serpents and worms and mites in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, because when it enters the body and is elevated to the head, it is perceived at the scent, for the strong smell which is in it causes the destruction of the scent, and what was seen there is no longer seen
Therefore when you want to cure it and extract it, you must not do so without seeing its walking and appearance, and when you see it you must cover what is above it and what is left of it must be bound and contracted strongly, and then dry over it and extract that.
And if it is prolonged in the flesh and you do not remove it, then you must place a pointed cautery over the area until it remains, and the greatest cause which is feared is the corruption of it as we have said
Or if it sometimes arrives at the head near the scent, then strengthen over the nails with great stricture, and dry over it, and extract that; and make sure that the patient takes purgatives of medicines evacuating bad humors, and keep away from foods that cause corruption
From the section above gout is not cured by surgery.<end_turn>
This disease is called in our land nafir, and it is a pain that is seen in several members, and it is confused from member to member.<end_turn>
And I have already said what I will recommend to you.<end_turn> I was called to a woman who was sick in a village, and I saw her arm swollen and I saw a small swelling in the funis vein of the arm, and when I left for an hour, I saw that swelling disappear as quickly as it had appeared, just as if it had been gold that was running from place to place.
And then I remained there with her for an hour while she was in pain in that place and I fixed my gaze on the muscle and here I sat for an hour.
Then correct the other side of the body until it reaches the opposite arm.
Then I recommend that you rotate the entire body sideways as much as you see fit; and do not marvel at the change of position and the speed of the limbs.</end_of_turn> I have already seen this happen in my days according to that method, however I have seen many who experience pain when the limbs are rearranged.</end_of_turn> I do not see this in the women in the same way as in the men.</end_of_turn
And I do not think that this is anything other than that the woman was of great age, when there are many bones and veins that are exposed, and in this state the sensation of that sudden change is produced.</end_of_turn
It is necessary that this does not appear according to this retrograde movement in those who are delicate and have humors of veins that are easily congested.</end_of_turn
And when you wish to care for them, and the patient feels that pain, do not be deceived by appearances as we have said, but strengthen your hand over that area and leave it loose so that the congestion is released, and cauterize the area.</end_of_turn
Perhaps if you do not see the thighs at this time, when you care for what is outside of the body and what expels the congestion, and sing those who are pale and yellow, and those who resemble pills of lead and of mercury.</end_of_turn
From the extraction of arrows.</end_of_turn>
Arrows are diverse according to the species, and according to the places of the body in which they are cast, because their diversity is that some have large heads, and small, and concave, and blunt; some are solid; and some have three angles, and some have tongues; and some have stems.</end_of_turn
And from the sign of the servant is when you strike the arrow and it passes through it, and is situated over the brain which is about the size of an egg, because this happens by the violence of the blow, and swelling, and vertigo, and hiccups in the chest, and inflammation and swelling of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding and vomiting of bile, and great pain is produced by the abscission of the word and the destruction of the voice, and it is situated in the place of the wound a white moisture resembling clots, and yellow resembling the consistency of blood.</end_of_turn
Therefore if you see these symptoms, do not attempt to care for or extract the arrow, if not outside.</end_of_turn
More often when the arrow strikes the heart, it is from the left breast, and is found to be fixed in a hard way, and is not a trivial cause; and it is seen that the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of a claw, and comes out with black blood, and if the temperature of the limbs is cold, and there is excessive sweating, and fainting; and therefore you must know that death approaches immediately.</end_of_turn
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are sometimes like that of black spots from the plague, and swelling of the veins that are near the gut is seen to be collapsed, and the color of the patient is changed, and great breathing is difficult, and gasping for air is required.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow strikes the membrane that is in the heel, and the pain is like that of small bones, and is accompanied by great pain and spasm, and does not affect all the muscles.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then great vomiting of the plague is seen to occur with any indigestion.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow strikes the liver and is fixed in it, vomiting of the plague is seen to occur with any wound of the flesh or vessel that is burst, and no hope is found in the cure of the extraction of the arrow.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow strikes the bladder and is expelled with urine, and proceeds from it any other cause to the outside, and great pain is seen over the patient, then you must know that it is fatal.</end_of_turn
The other limbs are saved as much as the face, the ear, the groin, the flanks, the chest, and the adjutant, and the scapulae of both, the furcula, the testicles, and the groin, according to the greatest precautions when the arrow does not find vein or artery and is not venomous.
And I recommend that you take note of this concerning the nature of these arrows, for it signifies concerning the treatment of your wounds.</end_of_turn>
The cause of which is that in a man an arrow went into the tear duct of his eye on the root of his nose, and I extracted that from the other side, leaving the pupil of his eye, and he is well, without any swelling of the eye at night.</end_of_turn
And I extracted another arrow from a woman who had been struck in the gray of her eyebrow, leaving the eyebrow untouched, and the arrow was already hidden, and we did not manage to extract it from her until a little piece of it adhered to the eyebrow, and it was a great arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion's head in which there were no barbs.</end_of_turn
And so it is with the woman, and she did not suffer on the eyebrow at all.</end_of_turn>
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man who had been struck in the groin, and it was an Arabian arrow, and there were barbs on it; and when I saw that it was immersed in the groin of the patient, I used two guides and I managed to extract it, and the Christian was well.</end_of_turn
And I extracted another arrow from a man who had been struck in the lower belly, and I thought he would surely die from it; and when more than xxx days had passed and no improvement had been made in his condition, I pierced the arrow and pulled it out, and he was well, without any swelling.</end_of_turn
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had gone through both thighs, and the plague was consolidated over them; and when I approached seven years later, I extracted the arrow from the root of the thigh.</end_of_turn
And I saw a woman who had been struck by an arrow in the lower belly, and the plague was consolidated inside her, and it did not improve in her condition even when she was treated with all her natural remedies.</end_of_turn
And I saw another man who had been struck by an arrow in his face, and the plague was consolidated and the arrow was broken, without causing him any pain, and his face remained as before.</end_of_turn
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king who had been struck in the middle of his nose, and already at the time a little piece had fallen out, and the whole arrow was hidden.</end_of_turn
And I was called to treat the king within three days of the arrow being shot.</end_of_turn
And when I arrived I found the plague of the arrow was not severe; and when I questioned the patient about any other pain, he did not feel any; however, he still felt a slight pain, leaving the pupil untouched, and I hoped that this pain was due to the tip of the arrow.</end>
And I plastered over the area with an astringent and digestive plaster, trusting that the area would recover because I saw the tip of the arrow coming out through that area.</end>
And there was no significant swelling at the site of the arrow; and I continued to apply the plaster for several days, and there was no further swelling. The plague had consolidated and the patient was well again, and he confirmed to me that the arrow had come out of his nose on its own within a few days.</end
And when I had finished with the acute corrosive medicine, I waited for a while, and when I had seen that the tip of the arrow had fallen out, I dressed the wound and extracted the remaining part of the arrow.</end
And I adjusted the dressing of the wound for that acute medicine until I saw the tip of the arrow clearly, and I left it for a while until four months had passed.</end
And when the plague had become more severe, I thought I should remove the forceps from it, and I did so, without observing any improvement, and I did not cease to try to pull out the arrow in various ways, until one day I managed to extract it; and I restored the wound.</end
And some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose was not restored, and I restored that as well, and the plague consolidated, and the patient was completely healed, without any recurrence of the pain.</end
And I recommend to you the quality of extraction of several needles so that you pause what is usual and explain what has not been said, for the parts of this art and the definitions of that are not comprehended by the narration or are not comprehended by this book.
The skilled artisans compare little with me; for I know what is present where it is absent, and I find new operations and novel instruments that must descend from the causes outside of this art when necessary
Therefore I say that needles are not foreign to the members in which they are inserted, but according to two methods: either by attraction of the tissue in which they are entangled; or on the contrary of the other side.
And that which is inserted by the tissue in which it is introduced, is a needle proceeding from a fleshy place, and is driven out and withdrawn.</start_of_turn>
And if you do not obey this time of day, the time that I have laid for you, then you must leave it for a few days until the flesh that surrounds it has healed, and the traction of the parts has ceased.</start_of_turn
Similarly, if it is inserted into bone and you do not obey this time, then leave it for a few days and repeat the traction and movement in each day, and it will finally be withdrawn.</start_of_turn
And if you do not obey this time at least for a few days, the time that I have indicated to you, then you must perforate in the circuit of the needle in that bone from the whole part towards the middle until the tissue is stretched by the needle, and then extract it.</start_of_turn
Maybe if the needle is already hidden in the body of the limb, and is hidden from the feeling, then you must inquire about it and if you feel it, then draw it out with the instruments that are convenient for the traction of the needle.</start_of_turn
And if you cannot do it because of the constriction of the plague and the length of the period, and here neither bone nor nerve nor vein, then you must wait for the plague to be stretched and for the needle to be able to be extracted.</start_of_turn
And if you have great anxieties about which you are ignorant, then you must deliberate on the whole surrounding of the needle from the whole part until you have devised something; and think about it, if you cannot devise the evasion of the flesh in the fracture of the nails and in twisting them until you obey.</start_of_turn
And when you administer the extraction of the needle in any place, then you must use with your hand and forceps at all parts until you have made that obey; and suggest with your right hand that the needle not be fractured and that it be easily extracted from your difficult traction and extraction.</start_of_turn
And if you cannot do it at this time, then you must leave it for a few days until the parts that are in the circuit are healed, and then repeat what you have to do so that the pain is alleviated.</start_of_turn Maybe if it contradicts the flow of health, then you must administer what we have said of care in the head.</start_of_turn
And keep your prudence of the incision of a vein or a nerve, or of a cord, and administer instruments in every way that you can for the evasion of the needle; and do it with ease, tranquility, promptness and calmness as I have said and as you have been taught.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must oppose the needle so that the illness is as it is according to the figure according to which you must carry out the cure of the needle, for it is more useful.</start_of_turn Maybe if this is not possible for you, then you must administer what is possible for you according to the figures.</start_of_turn
Maybe the needles that are withdrawn from the opposite side, or that already proceed from some part to the parts outside, or make swellings of the extraction of the needle by the feeling of the part further from the marrow sometimes; then you must desist from that; and be careful that the grasp is according to the quantity in which the forceps take hold; and then draw it out, because it is useful for the time being.</start_of_turn
If it is retained in the bone, then your touch shall move contrary to the usual, until the needle pierces the bone, and expand itself to the middle, and then extract that.
Or leave it there for a few days, and then repeat that until it comes out
And if the needle is stuck there, then immediately pull that out from it.</start_of_turn>
If it is loose and you want to administer an impulse, then insert your hand and that, if it is silent, stir cautiously so that between the curvature of the bone and the tip of the needle, and then pull that out from it.</start_of_turn>
If the needle is bent, then immediately pull that out from the bone, so that the needle is straightened by that.</start_of_turn
And if the needle is poisoned, then you must cover all the flesh in which it is seen, if possible, and then care for that until it heals.</start_of_turn
And if the needle sticks in the feet, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and is close enough for you to reach it, then touch that with your finger, and if possible remove that from there, for it is necessary to avoid the vein or nerve, and extract that, and then apply the bandage if necessary, and care for that until it heals.</start_of_turn
Form of forceps with which the needles are held:</start_of_turn
Their extremities are like the beak of a thrush that are useful when they grasp the needle so that it does not slip away.</start_of_turn
And there are various sizes of these, large, small, medium, according to the quantity of the greatness of the needle and of its thinness, and of the breadth of the wound, and of the constriction of it.</start_of_turn
Like that for so that the tissue of the needle is alleviated in the bent needle and is pulled out from that.</start_of_turn
Of flebotomy of the veins.</start_of_turn
The veins from which it is customarily bled for flebotomy are ...</start_of_turn of which there are sixteen in the head.</start_of_turn There are two pulse veins that are close to the armpits, which are called the alaris; two herbs that are in the two temporal bones that appear; and two veins in two tears from two holes that are called the lacrimal; and the vein prepared in the middle of the face, and the vein that is in the extremity of the nose; and two veins that are at the ear; and two veins that are in the lower lip; and two veins that are in the upper lip; and — these are called the palpebrals —; and there are two veins that are under the tongue.</start_of_turn But the veins that are bled in the arms are worth five.</start_of_turn For of those there is a cephalic vein, and it is lateral, and the people call it “the vein of the head,” and it is a medium vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilica, and of another branch of the cephalic; and they call that “the vein of all the body,” and the basilica is a vein that is stopped in the domestic lap, and is called “citellar,” and they call those vulgarly “the vein of the belly”; and funis of the arm, and is stopped over the elbow, and is that in which flebotomy is made, and is that which appears over the wrist for the manifestation; and the ulnar, and is the vein that is between the thumb and the little finger, and there are two branches in it.</start_of_turn
And in the foot and the thigh there are three veins; one of those is that which is behind the curvature of the lateral condyle; and the second is posterior, and the place of it is behind the crease of the domestic lap; and the sciatic vein, and the place of it is behind the crease of the lateral thigh; and in the thigh there are other veins similar to those.</start_of_turn
The benefit of the veins that are close to the armpits is to cause ancient catarrh, emigration, dropsy and ulcers of the head of bad antiquity.</start_of_turn
And the quality of bleeding those is according to what I recommend to you: that is that the patient’s head should be raised above the level of the wound, and that the patient’s head should be frequently washed in the occipital region in the place where the veins are to be lanced with abundant and good friction; and that you should strengthen the wound by tying the patient’s chin with a bandage between which appear the two holes and the places of their location are close to the armpits in two depressed parts of the head; and that you should hold that with your hand, and if you sit the patient’s arm down, here you should stretch with your hand.</start_of_turn
Aprop tu pren la lancea cutellar, e es aquela que es inscident, e aprop tu intromet aquel dejos la vena en la codena entro que·l fleubotomi vengua al os. And raise your hand with the vein and the cord towards the parts below and puncture the vein at the point where it is insident. And the length of the puncture is the amount of two fingers adjusted or around that; and do it as well as you please
And then strengthen around the powder and leave that which is inside until it is healed.</start_turn>
And thus is completed the beginning of the treatment of the wound and of their cauterization.</start_turn>
More than two veins or arteries that are at the temples help with phlebitis is the ancient emigration and so badness and blood clotting and excessive swelling of the belly.</start_turn
And the quality of phlebitis of these is as I recommend to you: constrict the patient's belly until two veins appear to be visible on the surface and when the pressure of their touch is confirmed by the hand; and when you see that, do not hesitate.</start_turn
And raise the cord above the vein to the parts below as I have said before, and make the phlebtomy puncture from outside, and elevate the vein with your hand; and puncture that as well as you did with the other two veins; and do as much healing as is necessary.</start_turn
And remove the dressing of the patient, and leave your hand on the vein for an hour, and then place your hand over that dressing and powder and strengthen that below with great constriction, and leave that which is inside until it is healed.</start_turn
And thus is completed the reminder of these things, and of those the wound, and the attraction in the beginning of the treatment.</start_turn
And therefore the help of phlebitis of the vein of the front is similar to the phlebitis of the cephalic vein to the ancient diseases of the face and to emigration and swelling and ulcers full of pus.</start_turn
And the quality of phlebitis of these is as I recommend to you; so that the patient tighten his belly with a belt until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is called fossori of which this is the form.</start_turn
Pause the puncture that is at the head of the fossori over that vein and puncture it at an angle or in any other way you like; and leave the healing run as much as you want; and then remove the perforation of the patient and strengthen that which is inside until it is healed.</start_turn
Many veins are opened with phlebitis, however it does not mean that the phlebitis is of acute extremity just as the others; because it can be of remote extremity, and phlebitis that is according to the transverse section, where the bone is proper and strong, is seen in phlebitis when it is subtle.</start_turn
More is the help of the two veins that are at the tears of two heels for scabies of the heels for swelling and pus in the heels, and to the diseases of the face.</start_turn
And the quality of phlebitis is that the patient tighten his belly with a belt, and do phlebitis of those, and you stay standing over the head of them.</start_turn
And the phlebitis is successful according to the transverse to a little phlebitis little, because in the area there is no marrow; and if the phlebitis is subtle, strong is the limb of it is fractured.</start_turn
And do as much healing as is necessary, and pause over those parts, and strengthen them for a night, and then remove them.</start_turn
More the phlebitis of the vein of the nose is with acute fever and with bad humors, and to the diseases of the face and emigration and swelling that happen in the face, and more especially when it is ancient.</start_turn
And the quality of phlebitis of these is that the patient tighten his belly with a belt and take his nose with your left hand, and make the phlebitis subtle long and leave that in the middle of the head of the nose according to the rectiline, because the vein does not appear to be sensitive here, and because the healing begins to flow freely.</start_turn
It should be covered that your hand is over the phlebitis little by little and that you let the healing run according to your need; and do that for a night, because that is restored pleasantly.</start_turn
The pain of the joints caused by cold humors which infiltrate all parts of the body, and the pain which occurs in the feet, is customarily called gout by doctors.
And its quality is that the patient groans without any pain in the belly; and the physician should be placed over the head of the patient, and the patient should sit on a stool.
And then, gently massage the vein along with wide small strokes; and extract blood according to the temperature, or according to how many times it is necessary; and do so without causing any pain.
And then, remove the ligament and tighten the two veins slightly so that the patient is not pained, and keep them within until the plague has healed
And the help of the evacuation of the veins is like little apostemas and blisters of the mouth and corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers which are on the nose and in the throat
And its quality is that it makes the patient vomit immediately, and tighten the neck of the patient with a bandage, and then rotate the lips of the patient and close two veins, one of which is from the right lip and the other from the left; and the sign of some of them is the blackness of some of both, and more when in the circuit of these veins there are many dark veins; and this is the sign of the case.
If there is any doubt, leave it to me, and do not know which of these is the case, when you understand the nature of the greater of these, and the pus that comes from them.
And make them resemble the two veins which are in the lips outside
More useful for the evacuation of the tongue is the evacuation of the cephalic vein towards the precipice which is in the gullet, to the disease of the uvula, and to the diseases of the mouth.
And its quality is that it makes the patient vomit between the teeth just as the sun sets, and raises the tongue of the patient, and leave the tongue between a tooth of the vein and the other tooth of the vein, and the color of each of them is tending towards blackness.
And when you have evacuated each one; and take care that you do not touch the artery with your hand, for it leaves them like veins
And the veins that are evacuated in the groin are usually the ones in which it is customary to do so in all men, and the evacuation of these is useful in two ways, either by making a large incision with a knife or by making an incision with an olive oil needle; or by making a small incision and holding with the thumb and index finger, and this is the way to do it
Both thumbs and index fingers like when dealing with large veins with abundant blood, and you must open the veins that contain thick blood clots apparent.
This incision is of smaller width and more subtle, and it is useful for the evacuation of subtle veins that contain blood clots of a subtle nature
The greatest help for the evacuation of the basilica vein is one of the three veins: which extracts the blood from the diseases that are left in the gullet and the neck, and from what is left of the legs and the belly
And it is recommended to the phlebotomist, when he evacuates that one, that he should guard well and be very careful in that one, because if he does not, he will tear the artery and there will be a flow of blood, so that he must cover that one by making an incision as if it were an abscess.
And if the basilica does not appear by outward signs, it is necessary that you leave that one and move to the other, or that you search for some branch of it; or that you evacuate from the end of the arm, which is also evident; and that you make an incision as we have said above.
May it be that if you wish to perform a flebotomy on them, then cover the stricture of the arm that touches the area within that you commence the incision of the veins, and hold it firmly; and then ligate the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision as with a flebotomy, as we have said; and keep the percussion steady for some space of the area of the artery.
And when you see, when you stretch the ligament, swelling in the area that you have marked with a touch, then know that that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that.</end_of_turn>
And if sometimes during the flebotomy blood flows like urine of a child, know that the blood is from the artery; and keep your hand steady and pause the thumb over that for a long space; and another hand hold the thumb and if the blood is split, know that the veins are split; then tighten your arm and release that.</end_of_turn>
And guard the patient from the urine of the catarrh, and be more temperate with them and do not frighten them for a while until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
Or if the blood is not split, and sometimes you must not be present a physician for this, then you must make an incision of the artery if it appears to you; for the limb will be contracted and the blood will be split; or that you take a slight fist and press that, and take the thumb and tighten that over the area of the vein with the stricture descending from the ligament and the dust inside until tomorrow.</end_of_turn
And if the blood is split, it is not well; otherwise, know that you must cure that from which the split blood of the veins has proceeded until the recollection of the place of the split veins of the flux of blood.</end_of_turn>
And the cutting off of the blood of the limb is difficult in many situations for the small size of the wound and the possibility of the ligament of the arm.</end_of_turn>
And from the femoral vein the flebotomy is useful in extracting the blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for it is composed of branches of the basilica and branches of the cephalic, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And cover the flebotomist if there is any excessive fear in the flebotomy of him, for it is a nerve; and if it is struck in the puncture of the flebotomy and the nerve is found, it will cause him to fall into a stupor, and it will be difficult for him to recover, and it will not be completely healed. And this nerve is often hidden from view by fat; and if it is covered by some people and is subtle and not shown, know that you must stop the flebotomy at the point where you began, and avoid the nerve with your force.</end_of_turn
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you must cut the vein in length.</end_of_turn
The usefulness of the flebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it extracts the blood from the head and comforts the ailments of the limbs.</end_of_turn
And take care in this way, if you wish that the flebotomist prick with the flebotomy oil or with the flebotomy myrtle; for that is the safest of all veins, for it is not of the arteries or nerves.</end_of_turn
And indeed it is often postponed in some people, when it is not done at the first percussion, but do not neglect it in this case.</end_of_turn
The first is that you must know that flebotomy is not administered except in the conservation of health and in hope of health and with caution of the occurrence of diseases, and that it is useful flebotomy in one of the veins that are in the vicinity, that is: cephalic, femoral and basilica; and that it is useful to perform the flebotomy at the beginning of spring, about the middle of spring and autumn, and in winter when there are signs of replenishment.</end>
And it is useful to perform the flebotomy and the third day or at the first that after sunrise three hours have passed.</end
When the flebotomy is administered, it must not be administered when it causes convenience and necessity for this, or at night or during the day, in every hour and at all times.</end
And take care that the young are not flebotomized until they are eighteen years old, and that the women are not flebotomized until the fourth month after the seventh, and that the old are not flebotomized who have already passed sixty years.</end
And when someone wants to be treated for any kind of pain, let him change his humors beforehand, so that the fistula may be carried out in the clister of the groin, for if there is any retained wound in those parts, so that the veins do not draw out the superfluous humors from the fistula of the intestines, which are pushed, and that they do not harm the principal parts.
And do not force the patients to undergo surgery without sufficient reason, neither repel them from illness or drunkenness until they have recovered from their ailment, neither from dropsy, for even if surgery is feared in this case with respect to the belly and vomiting, and with respect to the belly contents, and with respect to multiplying of stool and sweat, and of all the causes that dissolve virtue, or that are corporeal or animal in nature
And consider carefully the alteration of humors before giving them food and drink, and medicines if it is possible at this time
And take rest if any cause does not prohibit, or exercise with any exercise so that the patient may be relieved.
And stop the fistula in the patient's feet at the third hour, as we have said previously.
And take care that the patient's feet are protected on that day from all animal accidents, as well as from distress, fear, and from all bodily accidents, such as work, punishment, stool, and sweat
And at their leisure make present the causes that usually accompany the men of aromatic odor and smell and of balm and resemblance to those according to the quantity of possibility
And follow the surgeon over a cushion that is more solid than the cushion of that which must be used for the fistula
And take out the patient's arms, and cool that with your hand the surgeon gives two or three compressions; and bind it with a bandage two compressions.
And the stricture should be temperate, neither too tight nor too loose, for the stricture hinders the flow of the patient; or it is too soft, and the patient's body suffers from excessive sweating.
And when the stricture is finished, cool the patient's hands between them until the veins are swollen, and declare it to the feeling.
And the surgeon should anoint the patient's fistula with a little of their own oil properly; and then suspend the patient's hand over the place from which the fistula is to be made, so that the vein may escape a little, and so that the percussion should be relaxed because the vein is the one that is most at risk of being injured by the fistula, and is filled with blood, and when the surgeon places the fistula over that, it is contracted by the fistula, and is detected by the surgeon; and the fistula does not burst the vein, and if it bursts, that is stretched
Therefore, so that the surgeon is calmed and is satisfied in all these things.
And if the vein is burst in one compression, it is not good; and if so, repeat what you have done and leave that place a little, or over it put a fasting, if the place is not apostematized.
And if the place is apostematized, or the disease is spreading, the hours leave it alone for a day or two, and do not bind it, for that could cause a new bruise, nor enter into rest.
And repeat the fistula if necessary
And if the opening is small and the patient recovers well, and you fear that the quantity that you wish will not suffice, the hours repeat the fistula in that place according to custom and adjust in the opening a little, and do what is called fasting until the place is apostematized, for the place is apostematized in many men in the case of little opening
And sometimes if the place is already apostematized, do not repeat it, for it is not necessary for any cause; and suspend over that every part of the wound of oil, because it relieves the patient's body It is better in this place oil than any other oils.
And in general administer oil of the fistula with which the veins are prohibited of blood flow from the prohibition of the patient's body, and make them become thick like porridge when it is stopped from one of those over the place, because the patient is subtiliated and is softened when it is thick
And if in the place of the fistula there is generated great swelling, that many compressions have occurred, and especially if it has not bled except for that compression, or in the opening of the vein little by little, and the hours cover it, and suspend over the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, a little scraped, and press that for an hour, because it is dissolved
And cover that area with the same sheet as the one covering the vein or another vein.
If you remain in that place for a few days, any black spot or greenness will not be noticed; but if you wish, stop any cause of evil and look at dissolved matter, or any cause of bile or fat or anything similar to them.</end_of_turn>
And swollen veins that cause abscesses and swellings should be bled from the basilica.</end_of_turn>
Therefore place your hand on that area, and if you find that it is too soft, place your compression on that area, for that swelling is bad and harmful; and then keep your hand over that area to prevent any other liquid from flowing from the great artery.</end_of_turn
And apply pressure with that liquid which is astringent, so that the area is hardened, and then take care of the other care as before until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And extract from the vessel all the way down according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the color of the wound over the vessel according to how it appears.</end_of_turn
For if the vessel is black, then let it be left to rest until it is cured; and in the same way if it is thick, let it be left to rest until it is refined; and in the same way if it is acute, until the acuteness has passed.</end_of_turn
And concerning him who is full and strong and has need of extracting a vessel in a swelling, let the bleeding of the vein be increased and let the bleeding be liberal.</end_of_turn>
And in him who is pale, let the opposite be done, and cover that one should extract it gradually, and let there be little bleeding.</end_of_turn
The best thing in bleeding a vein is that it is a transverse section, not a puncture.</end_of_turn
And this method of bleeding is safe from the flow of blood and from the injury of nerves, and is more useful and safer than bleeding from the circumference and length.</end_of_turn
And when there is a fainting fit, you should perform the bleeding immediately; and after the bleeding has been performed with a little piece of bread soaked in wine instead of a thousand grains or of simple saffron, extract from the vessel three or four times.</end_of_turn
And if there is coldness of complexion, before performing the bleeding give an infusion of ipecac or of fragrant honey with spices like cinnamon, ginger and cloves, or with an aromatic and fragrant infusion.</end_of_turn
And if there is a fainting fit, you should perform the bleeding, and this is a cause of the fainting of the patient; then cover that you give him lukewarm water and an aromatic infusion; and use aromatic substances on the soles of his feet.</end_of_turn
And make use of the other causes that have been said in the division in the chapter on fainting for evacuation.</end_of_turn>
And who wishes to prevent the fainting of the patient and dissolve the vessels according to their nature, cover that from which the bleeding is performed is for the evacuation of the blood, and the virtue of these is cold, which evacuates the blood gradually, as is appropriate for the quantity of the virtue in continuous days.</end>
May he who wishes to prevent the fainting of the patient and stop the bleeding according to the physician's order, and the patient's body is strong, do this approximately seven or eight times from the first bleeding.</end_of_turn
May he who wishes to withdraw the blood from the body in the opposite direction to which it is inclined, cover that this should be done on the second or third day.</end_of_turn
May that body in which there is no blood left and which is acute and causes the fever, cover that the blood should be extracted from it once and a large quantity should be taken, and that the bleeding should be increased until fainting stops, for it is known that when the bleeder is ignorant and negligent, he causes death instead of fainting, because too much blood is taken when the bleeding is not known.</end_of_turn>
And do not cover that you wish to loosen the arms and evacuate the blood according to the day, when the orifice of the vein is closed and it is difficult for the blood to flow, for you must be aware of that and extend your hand firmly, for that is better.</end_of_turn
Let him remain until he is bled according to the method; or remain with the acute bleeding of the vein that is clotting in the orifice of the vein; or stop on the tyriaca or spleen, and compress that which is lighter until the blood is outside and still.</end_of_turn
If the vein is clotted, leave it alone and do not touch it until it has dissolved.
If it is necessary to evacuate the bowels according to the circumstances, and it is not excused, then leave that about that place or on the other arm in another vein.
When the vein is called "funis of arm" is flecked in the place of the flesh or the bone, when it is not obstructed or hidden, which is composed of those.
The quality of the fleck of the arm is that the patient puts their hand into cold water until the pain subsides and the vein becomes visible again.
And take hold of that ligament or stricture with force; and fleck according to the small traverse, not laterally or longitudinally
And let the opening be wide and let your flecking be on the junction of the hand a little bit.</start_of_turn>
And if the flow of the bowels is prohibited, then iterate your hand in cold water and let the bowels flow in the water until you achieve your need.</start_of_turn>
Moreover, even if it is summer, it is excused from the iteration of the hand in cold water, and it is sufficient to keep the body of the bowels in cold water during the winter.</start_of_turn
The flecking of this vein is more secure than all the others, because it has neither a pulsatile vein nor nerves.</start_of_turn>
The flecking of the little toe is related to the diseases of the heel.</start_of_turn
The quality of the flecking of the toe is that you strengthen the hand by ligament or hand, because you put it into cold water, until the vein is swollen and is shown at the same time; and then fleck across; and if you prick it with all of that, nothing will happen to it.</start_of_turn
And keep that you do not touch your hand with the flecking, because it leaves only the nerves of the fingers naked of flesh.</start_of_turn
And iterate your hand in cold water and let the bowels flow in that, because if you do not iterate your hand in cold water, the bowels will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and it is prohibited to flow.</start_of_turn
And when the bowels are extracted according to the quantity of need, then you rest over the vein with oil and salt, so that it is not solidified too much; and immediately cover that you may not tear it.</start_of_turn
Moreover, the benefit of the flecking of the little toe is that it is related to the diseases of the heel.</start_of_turn
And do the same in the flecking of the toe as you did in the other.</start_of_turn
The benefit of the median vein flecking is for the diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the major limbs, retention of menstruation, and diseases of the veins and ulcers of the buttocks and ancient abscesses, and their remnants.</start_of_turn
The quality of the flecking of the foot is that the patient puts their whole foot into cold water and makes over that friction until the veins become visible; and they tie over the ankle of the foot with a cord; and the place of the vein they make appear by pulling on the thumb, from which there branch out in the face of the foot many veins.</start_of_turn
Therefore, fleck the widest vein or leave the limb over the ankle where there is swelling of it, because it is better and more salt.</start_of_turn
And if you fleck on the face of the foot, then you must keep away from the nerves that are left on the face of the foot, and stop your flecking with the one with which you fleck across, as if you wanted to prick it.</start_of_turn
And take care of the flecking.</start_of_turn>
Moreover, if the evacuation of the bowels is prohibited; then iterate the foot of the bowels in cold water and let the bowels flow in that until it is evacuated.</start_of_turn
And if the flecker makes a mistake in the first attempt, then iterate with the fleck a little while, because the place is salt; and do not be afraid of it, but take care of the nerves as we have said.</start_of_turn
And do the same with the other foot as well.</start_of_turn
The sciatic nerve, which has its origin in the thigh, must be freed from the cavity of the wild beast.
The help of the incision of the limbs is to make an opening when it is for the cure of the cautery
The quality of the incision of the limbs is that the patient lies in water, and that the belly is bound and the thigh is opened from the hip to the ankle with four fingers on a long strip that does not appear except for that
Therefore, when it appears, do the incision according to each case as you are able, and as for the transverse, it is better; or do the incision from within or the excision from without, because the place of the limb is outside.
And it is in most men more hidden; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the feeling of all, then make an incision of some limb, and that is the one that appears in the two of the foot rather than in the ear and the nose.
And take care of the nerves, and let the healing run its course as much as you want
And then loosen the stricture and keep it over the place of the incision so that the wound is strengthened, because it is healthy.
From the wound and from the qualities of using those.
Winds are of barley, or of hemp, or of ivy.
And the wind is useful in two ways: one of them is by scarification and extraction of healing, and the other is by the wind itself
And this wind that is from the scarification is done in two ways, because it can be both with fire or without fire.
And to the winds that are administered with scarification and extraction of healing are fourteen parts of the body, of which one in which the winds are stopped is the ankle; and the middle part of the thigh; and the two parts of the elbow; and the winds from the chin down to the jaw; and the winds from the two eyebrows; and the winds from the back of the head; and the winds from two nails; and the winds from two flames; and the winds from two glasses; and the winds from two cushions; and the winds from two cushions.
The wind does not extract the healing except from the small veins scattered throughout the flesh, and for that it does not take away the power of these, just as in the case of the incision; nor does it mean that the wind is useful with fire or without fire in any disease that is useful for emptying everything that is in the body
Maybe if necessary we can cause a wound for disease or for continuing, let us administer it at the beginning and at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month and whenever we want.
Therefore, whenever in any case of these, and especially if it is in the third or half of the month, we must command the wind to be more useful than it has passed the two or three hours of the day.
And the help of the wind from the nape is that when it confers to gravity in the head and to what is poured down to the bowels; however, we must not think that this is equal to the evacuation of everything from the body
This wind is in the place of the cephalic incision.
It is not proper for anyone who is feverish complete or in whom there is congestion to use this wind, because it gives great harm to that great document.
And for that we must not use it for the old people, and in the heads of those in whom there are feverish diseases.
However, for him on whom it continues to be continuous is useful oblivion; and for that we must command the windworker to stop his hand a little with the wind towards the back, fearing the generation of oblivion.
The wind of alkehel is in the place of the incision of the veins of the stomach and of the belly: and for that it confers to spasm, and to the constriction of bile and to the scissura of the suffering of bile, and to coughs, and to repletion
The wind that blows from the south brings a small chill, which if it is stopped brings sickness in the body and the stomach.
The air from the south brings cold to the head and the eyes, causes vomiting, diarrhea, and pain in the gums; it is better than a blistering purgation of mercury.</end_of_turn>
And command the windblower not to touch his hand lest he cut the artery and cause blood to flow backwards.</end_of_turn>
The southern wind brings cold to the mouth, corrupts the gums, and causes the breath to stink like that of diseases of the mouth, and is better than vomiting of food from the nostrils.</end_of_turn
Better is the wind that comes from the buttocks than that which comes from the armpits, which brings cold and is useful for replacing heat.</end_of_turn>
The wind from the buttocks comes from the bowels of the bones and helps to expel three veins, namely the basilica, jugular, and cephalic, for those three veins drain all the other veins which are more numerous in the body, and the smaller veins of the other veins which are more extensive than those which remain within the attraction of the three veins.</end_of_turn
Command the windblower not to proceed too far in his sacrifice, for the place is denuded of flesh, and leaves nerves and arteries exposed.</end_of_turn
And it is a wind which brings cold upon the buttocks and causes hemorrhoids and ulcers below.</end_of_turn
Command the windblower that it be a strong wind, and that it be from the south, for the place cannot bear a strong dry wind; and let there be fine rain falling and a slight sacrifice.</end_of_turn>
Better are the small cold winds than great ones that make the body cold, cause pain in the bones and the marrow, the bladder; provoke menstruation, cause thirst, and cause swelling and boils.</end_of_turn
But they do not benefit the whole body and cause vomiting in many people.</end_of_turn>
The best of all winds is the one that comes from the two cambas.</end_of_turn
The quality of the position of the winds is that you pause the wind when it starts and wait for a temperate breath, and do not prolong the position of the wind, but rather pause it quickly and keep it slightly, and that the humors come to the place by chance without being forced.</end_of_turn Do not cease until you see the place already inflamed and swollen and that the redness of the blood appears.</end_of_turn
And when you have sacrificed and iterated the breath a little at a time, and when you have considered the condition of the body.</end_of_turn
For a person of sensitive flesh and rare pores, command that you give him a slight scarification and do not press too much, for the place is not to be ulcerated.</end_of_turn
Command the windblower to enlarge the sacrifice and make a pause, and breathe slowly and easily.</end_of_turn
And if there is thickness in the blood, then command that you make two slight incisions, for in the first incision the passage of the fine blood to the blood and water is opened.</end_of_turn Better in the second one is the extraction of the thick blood.</end_of_turn
And if the blood is not thick, then command that you make a third slight incision for it to succeed.</end_of_turn
Finally, when you want to extract the blood a little at a time or a little, suffice with a slight incision.</end_of_turn
And if you want to extract a lot of blood, make a great incision; and if you know that the blood is thick, then command that you make a greater incision for a wound.</end_of_turn
And the end of the sacrifice is only the depth of the wound.</end_of_turn
And if the person from whom the wound is large, hard, tough, and has wide pores, command that his wounds be oiled with gentler unguents, resolving salves; if it is in summer, thus is oil of aloes or oil of violets, or oil of chamomile buds, or oil of poppy seeds; and if it is in winter, then oil of marigold, or oil of lily, or oil of camomile, or of saffron.</end>
If the excess is great, cold, it is customary to apply either butter, balm oil, aloe oil, or almond oil, and so on.
If the wind blower is of great quantity of soft fat, it is customary to command that no oil be used, and that at these places where there are winds from, to these apply lotions of winds such as vinegar or fresh water from the sun, or water of lilies, or water of marigolds, or water of chamomile, and so on.</end_of_turn>
And as for him of whom it is said to have moisture of humors, wash his winds with wine vinegar, or water of myrtle, and sage and so on.</end_of_turn>
And as for him of whom the excesses are great, wash his winds with wine vinegar, or water of rosemary, or sage, or chamomile, and so on.</end_of_turn>
And it is commanded that the windblower be protected from bathing; having said that it should be administered immediately after the bath for an hour or two, and that it should rest after the windblowing.</end_of_turn
What should be done so that the windblower returns from phlebotomy before the windblowing?
Consider at the beginning: if the windblower or the one who must draw blood is bilious and has a strong wind and an acute inflammation, it is customary to prevent cold causes, such as many vinegar and lettuce, and sage, and thyme, and juniper, and so on.</end_of_turn>
And suspend their foods such as poultry, fatty meats, foods with vinegar, and foods with fat, and so on.</end_of_turn
And as for him of whom the complexion is cold, it is customary to command the drinking of almond milk, or almond oil of seeds, or sage, and to smell of marigolds between wool and flax; and it is commanded that he should use little wine and eat little, and suspend the foods of poultry, pork, fish and shellfish, eggs and barley.</end_of_turn
And it is commanded that on the day of windblowing and phlebotomy the drinking should be greater than the food.</end_of_turn
And it is commanded that in certain hours before meals such as barley bread, or mustard, or radish before the windblowing or before phlebotomy or soon after, so that the principal parts be comforted and the patient be relieved; and do not take vinegar.</end_of_turn
And the winds which are not sacrifices are those which suspend their fetor on the belly and the heel, and on the navel, in the joints of the fingers, and the biting of the ankle, so that these members do not suffer sacrifice upon them.</end_of_turn
And it is not desired for these except for the attraction of the health of the limb, as when wind blows over a boil in the disease of the flow of blood from the limb; and they use this so that the cold wind is dissipated from the limb, as when it blows over the belly and the navel; for this softens the limb and heals the pain which the wind resolves.</end_of_turn
And it is known about the winds that when they happen in their opposition or in their collection, for the power of attraction is strong enough to expel the phlegm from its place and to expel the pus from its place.</end_of_turn
Similarly, when it is blown over the belly and the heel you must remove the wind from those closed places.</end_of_turn>
These winds are administered wet with juice alone; and some are administered with fire.</end_of_turn
Some foods are administered full of cold water in the diseases of the belly.</end_of_turn
And this is because the wind should be full and greater, so it is cold water alone or water in which herbs are boiled according to convenience.</end_of_turn
In the form of wind administered with fire: the breadth of the orifice of two fingers, as we have formed it; and the quantity of the preparation is half a palm; and it is to be put on the flanks, in the place where it is in the circuit, half of it, the neck should be small according to the quantity that enters it with a needle.</end_of_turn
Whether from barley or citrons, from orange marigolds, lion's mane, gentian and acacia for so that it does not harm the limb from its position over it.</end_of_turn
And at the middle of it put the candle with the fire.</end_of_turn
E ja sia questa ventoza gran major de quella la qual havem recomtat; e la pauca mendre de quella secondo le malautias e la etat di chi la usa di quella.
And this current of air is much greater than the one we recommended; and the little rest that remains is according to the illness and the condition of the one who uses it.
And the quality of stopping this current of air is that you extend the flame over the limb by kindling a little candle of wax downwards from the heel of the little toe, and you place that over the middle of the great toe where the current of air is, so that the flame is kindled around the outside to prevent it from burning the body of the patient
And then place your hand over the limb of the patient, and tell him what we have told you, that when we have the current of air and do not ask for it, it escapes through that opening and that the current of air will be as dispersed.
And so light the flame according to its custom, and repeat that if you ask for it again.</start_of_turn>
More in the current that is administered in the disease of gout, with water, in which there is neither great toe nor opening, and which is administered only when it is full of water, and is placed over the limb alone.</start_of_turn>
And this is the way to do it: This current, when it is greater, is better, because it receives a great quantity of water.</start_of_turn
The text ends here.</start_of_turn>
Bloodletting is not administered in all limbs but in the limbs in which the position of the current is not possible, because of the small size of those, thus as in the thumb and little finger; or in limb devoid of flesh, thus as in the nose and ear when it is swollen.</start_of_turn
And the quality of using those bloodlettings that you have found is that they are in the deep veins of the thigh.</start_of_turn
And then they are left lying down during the day and night in deep veins until they become faint; and that no cause remains in the belly of those; and that you evacuate the body at the beginning with bleeding and with current; and that you cool the limb of the patient until it turns red; and that you place your hand over it.</start_of_turn
When they are full and cold.</start_of_turn
And if it is possible to draw out the area with the current, it is better later in the treatment.</start_of_turn
And if not, then you should wash the area with wine vinegar and pour some cold water over it; and cool and press.</start_of_turn
And if the course of the disease prolongs itself despite the bloodletting, and if that remains, then you should place a sponge soaked in cold water over it, and keep that until the discharge is over.</start_of_turn
And if the disease is multiplied, then you should sprinkle over it powdered vitriol, or alum and such like causes of stricture, until the disease is cured; or that you place over the area the masses of scraped barley, and that you leave them until the barley sticks to the area, and the disease is cured.</start_of_turn
And so, if necessary, repeat the bloodletting, when possible changing those.</start_of_turn
And if bloodletting is prohibited in suspension, then you should cool the area with the recent disease or leave a needle in the area until the disease subsides; and you should keep it still, so that those that feel some disease may feel better.</start_of_turn
And when you want to finish, sprinkle over those a little of powdered aloe, or salt, or ash, and cover all.</start_of_turn
Thus ends the treatise on the third part: restoration.</start_of_turn This chapter is very useful for the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fracture and dislocation of bones.</start_of_turn
Oh, son, wise men, listen to me, the fools of the doctors and the vulgarians and those who at some time do not remember the ancients or do not read their books.
And for this reason it is useful that this custom of the learned men in our land be kept private; and I have not forgotten it at any time in my life; and I have not learned it from anyone else, but by reading the books of the ancients and studying their understanding of them.
And I add to this experience and study throughout my life.</start_of_turn
And thus I have already described in this chapter all that concerns my knowledge and my experience concerning this matter; for I have abridged what is appropriate for you others and delivered you from the burden of long explanations; and I have opened up in the end of abbreviation; and I have shown in the end of the declaration; and I have formed in this matter various forms of the treatments which are administered in this case, as it is customary in addition to the declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
First Chapter.
Summary and collection of this fracture of bones, from which the preceding preface is necessary before we proceed to the remembrance of fractured limbs and diverse parts of each one Therefore, let us speak in the preface of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters which follow will contain an explanation of the artifices and their station on the truth of those things; for you and those who understand this noble art will learn or reinforce what you already know
And therefore I say that when an accident of fracture or dislocation or twist or case happens, the hour covers that you should immediately apply an ointment or plaster to that, or something similar, if you do not prevent any cause, as befits prudence, or if that which has happened is to a newborn, an old person in decrepitude, or is a time of violent heat or violent cold.
And thus let there be content in food either of fresh herbs or of boiled meats of fish and crab; and prohibit large meats and fill if of food and of all food which fills the veins of health, except that you keep an eye on the caut of the apostem and if you do not fear the effusion of matter from the limb
And the hour returns the patient to their first position in which they usually lie.
And thus when the fractured bone begins to be restored, the hour covers that the patient should not be given nourishing foods of great size and hardness in which there is viscosity, as for example oatmeal cooked with water, barley, rice, eggs, fish, beef, calves' brains, and turnips, for in this regimen there is a coagulation of the fracture more pleasantly and gently
And you must know that bones break when they are in the homes that are in the first youth and in the decrepit, it is not possible that they should continue and be consolidated according to their nature because of the drying out of their limbs
Moreover, nature adjusts and remembers that the fractured bone of every part whatever the cause may be similar to a knot in which thickness adheres and strengthens that which is joined together until it is congealed and joined together, until the end of suffering and rest, as for example fire at the beginning, until any cause does not prevent that from its work
For this reason it is necessary to abstain from feeding the patient, foods in which there is gravity and viscosity and greatness, as we have said.
And you must know that the species of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limb, for the fracture of the bone of the thigh is different from the fracture of the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the foot is different from the fracture of the bone of the forearm; and similarly all the others are diverse among them
And I see in memory all the species of fracture, explained in a distinct chapter of each one
Many different fractures in general.<end_turn> And they are diversified the species of fracture of the bone in their general; for it is a useful fracture arched another that happens in their stars; and some fractures are useful according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the bone of the thigh and hip and ankle which proceed from some cause and others do not proceed from it, just as it is useful in writing when it is prepared to be written, and is a fracture with plate and disruption in the head, and is a slight fracture of the bone.
And each species has its own origin or torment in the restoration of the limb according to what will be remembered in the different places
Sign of bone fracture.<end_turn And for this reason a bone fracture is known: it is the tortuousness of the limb, and of that eminence and appearance of the limb to the sense, and so of it when it compremes it with your hand
And therefore when there is no apparent tortuousness or if it is not believed to be present, you must not touch it when you touch the bone without causing the patient great pain, for the hour is not here a fracture in that case
It is possible that there is pain or a small fracture, whereupon you must not move that limb with your hand or compress it; it is best to rest it and apply the appropriate medicine at the opportune moment.
And if the limb is bent and not fractured in two or otherwise so that it does not cause suffering throughout its entirety, when it is necessary to begin to rectify it, do not delay but immediately perform the necessary cautery
If after the cautery the swelling persists, leave it for a few days until it subsides; and then apply any appropriate means such as lifting and fomenting.</start_of_turn>
Remember that the restoration of the limb and the application of oil are lighter than the os itself which is affected by suffering.</start_of_turn>
And thus remember what has been said previously.</start_of_turn
Even if there is fracture in the bone, it is necessary to extend this fractured limb from two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two strings or with one string and your hand.</start_of_turn
And keep your limb in the position in which it naturally rests, while the fractured parts are extended from the limb; thus you will prevent the return of those tensions which occur in their places.</start_of_turn
Remember that you must not cause further pain or injury to the patient during your treatment; apply your skill in such a way as to join one bone to the other in a companionable manner in a thousand different ways.</start_of_turn
And take advantage of your touch with your hand at that moment, and if sometimes there is some other cause, rectify that and embrace that for the amount of your virtue.</start_of_turn
Avoid excessive extension and compression, just as foolish doctors often do when they perform cautery, causing swelling after their operation, or when they cause contraction of the limb in the way we have seen in the treatment of their boils.</start_of_turn
And the quality of the stricture of the limb is that which I recommend; for you know that fractured limbs are diverse in their smallness and greatness and in their form.</start_of_turn
And of those which are small, such as the arm and the finger and the toe, the covering should be of much finer silk.</start_of_turn
And of those which are large, such as the thigh or the chest, cover them with firm and tough covering, which connects the great limb firmly and strengthens that throughout the stricture with equal tension, so that there is no bruising.</start_of_turn
And thus begin, make your evacuation and application of the liament convenient at that place, with three or four coverings according to the size of the limb; and tighten your hand slightly over the liament.</start_of_turn
And behold that at the more prominent part of the place of the fracture, tighten more than the tension of your stricture with which you have strengthened the place of the fracture.</start_of_turn And thus lengthen the covering of the place of the fracture a little, and soften the tension little by little, until you have taken hold of a large part of the limb.</start_of_turn
And thus take another bandage and cover that other covering over the fractured limb with covering, and behold that the coverings are at the furthest part from the fracture; and your operation on the stricture of the covering and in the softening of that which we have said in the first covering should suffice.</start_of_turn
And rest between the stoppings of straw or silk in which the pain of the fracture is appeased, if there is pain; but if not, do not rest it for any cause.</start_of_turn
And rest upon it another bandage, and tightly embrace these coverings well; if there is no swelling or cautery swelling in the limb, and when the swelling has subsided and the pain has gone; leave it like that for a few days; and tighten over it again.</start_of_turn
And if it is of the joints of the big toe, or of the thumb, or of the index finger, or of the middle finger, or of the ring finger, or of the little finger, let the breadth of each stalk be in this manner and in this figure:
However, cover that the staple which is laid upon that fracture is larger and wider than the others, and the length of the staple according to what is legible on the limb in magnitude and smallness; and do so with another object as per your first order. And bind firmly about the staple as per what has been said above, and let your order be according to the place of the fracture, and as much as the fracture is prolonged, the more it is necessary to order.
And cover that the threads be thicker in bulk and fineness, and be of thread like silk. And if the threads are coarse, thus do I know by the operation of the callous fractures that they are loosened during the operation of the nails, and it is a great error when they are equal in size.
And the fine threads are not convenient, for you will not secure the staple with those which you wish. And do not cover that there should be less than a finger's breadth between the staple and the staple.
And if the patient is of such a kind that his limbs are close to the staple at the places where you wish to place it, then suspend those from the stone or from the leather until they do not cause him damage.
Some wounds of fractures are like a wound, and an accident of disruption in the tendon, and I remind you of that in the chapter according to singularity
And you know that every fractured limb is not straight on the first day; the cause of which is that when the limb is great, it does not cover that you should place it upon the staples but rather after a few days or eight or ten, according to your security of the coming on of suppuration of the wound
This is the manner of dressing which the Ancients restored, which were placed upon fracture and dislocation and twisting.
Method of dressing as a remedy for the restoration of fractures, convenient for many complex and mostly for the thighs and the elbows, because it is of that from which neither heat nor cold is blown: and you take from the powder of wheat, which is the marrow of the wheat that hangs behind the movement of the germ in the parts of the wheat
And be careful that it is thus, but if there is an album of blood, stop the flow of it not so thick nor so fluid; and use that.
Another method of dressing for fracture, dislocation and twist: recipe of asafoetida, of lapdanum, of acacia, of enula, and marigold, which is ground from a thousand grains of coriander, by five drachs; of myrrh and aloes by three drachs; of asafoetida by two drachs. All of these are powdered and sieved and are mixed with water and vinegar or with egg white if the patient's wound is raw; and indeed use this dressing, which is of good composition and restores the fractured bones pleasantly, and gives relief to many people.</end_of_turn>
Another method of dressing for which will give relief to fracture and twist: recipe marigold and white alum root by five drachs; of myrrh and aloes by three drachs; of acacia by two drachs; of linseed by two drachs.</end_of_turn
All of them are crushed in a mortar with a stone container, and are crushed, and are comforted with water or with blood and is administered
Method of dressing for joints and bones separated in their places, and silk pain that happens in those and in fractures and breaks: take fine linen and immerse it in vinegar and oil and place it over the place.
More in this dressing is not useful for restoration, of suppuration of the wound and eliminates pain properly
Another method of dressing that restores bones that are broken: take leaves of fig tree out and wild poppy leaves; gather them all up and make a dressing of them
Manieyra de emplastre abreujat aministrat deves la restauracio de fractura de os e quan tu voles resolucio del romanent de apostema: recipe razitz de altea, de camamilla e flors de violes, de farina de ers, de totz ana partida .i.; Manier of brief dressing administered gives restoration of bone fracture and when you want resolution of the remnant of embolism: recipe of broth of elderberry, chamomile and violets flowers, oatmeal flour, of all things departed.
But if it is scorched, then comfort him with cold water of colander or with water and use of it.
Another manner of dressing is stronger in resolution of this first, when the accident of embolism is of long duration you must give restoration of the limb: recipe of broth of elderberry and linseed seeds, of beeswax, meadowsweet, violets, chamomile, of all things departed and oil; all are triturated and are comfortable with water of broth or water of any kind or wine, according to the quality of the limb and the color of it.
Hippocrates does not say that it is to be left free that it is paused over the limb except that certain fat is done from wax and oil and not otherwise; and it is recommended that it be more moderate between coarseness and fineness.
More frequently it is seen that it is paused over the fractured limb except for the restoration of it and the causes in which it is excessive cold or slight heat so as to be like those which we have recommended
Manner of dressing that gives comfort to the lesion and pain: recipe of mustard, of rue, of pounded fennel seeds or penalty of vinegar, of elderberry, salt, parts of oil; all are triturated and sieved and are comfortable, and be useful dressing.
More the quantity according to which you must keep the ligature and nearby should be disliked, is that you consider if there is not excessive pain or swelling or the bone is not fractured it is not bad that it is so. And if by chance to the area pain or swelling or inflammation occurs, the hours you must cover or remove that in the hour, and keep the dressing of it.
And take sponge of lint and marine sponge soaked in warm water, and put that in water warm, and at that bathe the area until the swelling and pain cease; and then remove the dressing from it for an hour; and then put over it a cloth soaked in vinegar and oil or olive oil, and bind over it for a night until you are sure of the cessation of embolism, and that the swelling of the limb is diminished, and that the pain of it is relieved
And do the same with that stricture little and do not tighten it for your first constriction, and submit to that until it is healed.
And if sometimes embolism and swelling and pain and inflammation and all these accidents already are relieved of all, and digestion of dressing and constriction is recommended, the hours you must do the same as you did at the beginning of healing.
And if no other cause has happened to the limb of which we have said, the hours you must not remove it until three or four or five or seven days have passed and some say that all that is left is left for xx days according to your habit for the loosening of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and when the coagulacion of the marrow over that has taken place.
And the hours you must adjust in the stricture more than in your first stricture throughout, and adjust in the digestion of the food of the patient, as it is preceded by the memory of it
More if sometimes the area of the fracture is already dry and swollen more than not to cover it, the hours you must know that the food is prohibited from going to that; and therefore take from him warm water of the whole three days; and relieve the stricture a little, and for this operation go to the limb the food, and that is healed without any discomfort.
More than what the rest of the healers of the fracture of the limb do another time when not restored at the beginning, according to that which covers, and is restored according to crookedness, is an error according to their operation, and a great fear, and if it should be so, it would enlarge the ailments in those that are free and would worsen at that which is done.
And I have not seen that anyone has done that, for it is more reasonable that it does not do it
Chapter: Of fracture when it happens in the head.
The species of fractures are many, and the figures of them are diverse, and the causes are diverse, for any fracture is caused by percussion of space, and the percussion stops all the bone within the cavity, which is left by it, as in the wrist, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called buckle; or the space strikes any part of the bone, and strikes the marrow of it and does not pass the incision beyond the back of it; and this kind of fracture is called elevation absolute.
The pain of these two fractures is either great or slight, and from a fracture that is contracted or relaxed; the cause of these is percussion from a hard object or a fall on a stone.
This fracture is either penetrating, that is to say that it approaches the bone, or on the face of the bone; and the pain of these two fractures is either great or slight.</end_of_turn>
Or the fracture is that which is hidden in the bone, in the marrow of the small bone, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called capillary.</end_of_turn>
And this fracture is caused by violence or by a fall or by percussion from a stone; this causes any lamina of the bone to enter the fragments, and is caused in the hollow part just as when stones are struck together and one fragment enters the fragments.</end_of_turn
And it is mostly caused in the joints of humiferous bones, as in the knees.</end_of_turn>
And in all these kinds of fractures that lie close together, they are like separated stars.</end_of_turn And I must remind you of all this that is in this place.</end_of_turn>
And I know all these kinds of fractures by recognition on them and by their signs and symptoms, and for the detection of corruption of the flesh that is over them.</end_of_turn>
And the capillary fracture is known by this that it is discovered on the bone, and it is excised, and a tent is placed over it, so that the fracture is black.</end_of_turn
Moreover in the treatment of fractures one must take into consideration at the beginning the signs of the patient, and when sometimes for the signs that signify in meaning vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of consciousness, and vomiting of blood, and fainting, and fever, and immediately from these symptoms, as well as from the greater part of the symptoms, the physician must not be negligent.</end_of_turn
And if sometimes serious accidents do not threaten your life, the hour you begin to treat them.</end_of_turn
Which cause is that if it is verified at the beginning like verified and that it is in the days of winter, the hour you must study in the bone marrow from the thirteenth day according to all ability.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the summer days, the hour you must hide the bone from the seventh day, having observed that what is left of the bone is corrupted from the marrow, and that these accidents have been recommended.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture has already reached the marrow covering the brain, and is contracted or relaxed, the hour you must suture the smaller fragments and the fracture, as I have recommended to you.</end_of_turn
And it is that you take hold of the head of the patient that is affected, and uncover the bone according to custom and handle it as you are able according to the figure of the wound, and that you are curious about the patient.</end_of_turn
And if it happens to you that you must detect the bone, flux of ointment or caustic paste, the hour you oppose it by that which covers it, and that you cover the area with cloths soaked in wine and oil, and make the wound rest until the paste has subsided; and make sure that there is flux of ointment; and begin immediately in the surrounding area of the bone and in the incision of the bone.</end_of_turn
And this is according to two methods of operating.</end_of_turn
And one of the methods is that you cut the bone with a straight incision, and this is the form of it: And then you administer another incision, a little wider than the first; and this is the form of it.</end_of_turn
And you administer more of the wider incision than the first.</end_of_turn
And cover that you must give your name of various incisions, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are longer than others and are at the end of the slope of their extremities, and are of iron or steel.</end_of_turn
And use them to facilitate percussion on the incision so that it does not burst the head and lead to that.</end_of_turn
And if the bone is strong, hard, the hour you must perforate in the circuit of it before you administer the incisions, which are called non-penetrating incisions.</end_of_turn
And they are not called thus except that those do not stop the end of the bone until it is close to it, for the puncture is round at the extremity or margin over that which is left the head of it appearing like a margin or small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing the spissitude of the bone.</end_of_turn
It is appropriate that you take a great number of these travels, for each one will be convenient in every test of the brain and the extremity that is acute, as regards its length and shortness, is according to the quantity of spiciness of this test.
This is the way of three types of travels: the quality of boring through the broken bone circuit is that you stop the travel over the bone and rotate that which is between the toes until you know that the bone has already been pierced; and then change the travel to another location and stop when there is between all the quantity of the thickness of the ray or send it away.
And then insert the needle at the level of each break of the bone, and make that pus more subtle than you would over what is in the end of floating, as we have said, until you have eradicated the bone, or with your hand, or with any other cause of these movements that are appropriate to it, as for example, nails and delicate forceps
And that you take care that the needle does not touch any cause of swelling
And thus when the bone is pierced by the circuit, and if it is separated from the swelling if it is prolonged with it, then extract that and cover that with the roughness of that in the bone like the other injury resembling the incision, but nevertheless cover that it is more soft and subtle than the others.
And if there remain any small parts of the bones and fragments, then take that which facilitates you from the injuries; and then take care of the wound with lint and ointment as we have said
And another way of operating is light, long, which says: dissect Gualia and the lauzec for a great surgeon; and this is the saying of them: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin to discover the part of the bone of the place where the fracture is the most acute and most obvious, until when you have discovered that part and you have stopped leaving that extremity of the incision calm, this is the way:
And that the blunt part is round and does not touch any cause, and the acute part is from it on two sides forward in length, as sometimes; that the blunt part is adjusted to the swelling with the face of the acute incision on the bone.
And then pierce over the incision with a little mallet so that you can rotate all the bone easily as well as that which is rotated, and you will be sure of the safety that it does not happen by chance in any way, and if the physician is the most learned of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he were asleep.
And if there remains any accessory cause connected to the bone of the area of the incision, puncture that which is at the extremity of the incision that is blunt, and drain that which is facilitated, which is drained by day and by night.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate inside the cavity, and what is broken or remains of the bone is the face of it, and remains in the roughness and fragments, then take that you have covered that roughness and eradicated those fragments with subtle reasons for the number you have prepared, of various quantities so that you can manage to administer them in all places the most convenient for them and the most safe for them according to what you lose in your operation that broken bone and its shape
And take care that you administer at your ratio as many of these reasons as those reasons for the bone at the beginning of the most liquid of those reasons, and then use more of the soft pus than the hard, and do not stop until you have administered the most liquid and the soft of all of them.
Moreover in any other small fractures capillaries and slight fracture, take care that you administer with care according to what you lose for the rectification of it.
And it is known to all that has been studied in that art. And so we have shown in great fractures
And if the cavity is rectangular when you have eradicated the bone, then take hold of it by the quantity of the wound, and immerse that in olive oil, and place that over the orifice of the wound; and take another sponge doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and olive oil and place that over the sponge first and make the pus come out willingly that comes over that, that it does not harm the swelling; and then administer over that bandage lateral, and do not tighten that until the wound is only as wide as the wound alone
And leave that in this care for a day or two until you are sure that the wound has healed; and then remove that and administer medicines which are superfluous such as vinegar and barley flour, and powder of alum and of surgery, and similar to those.
The disease of gout is caused by cold humors that penetrate every part of the body. When pain occurs in the feet, doctors usually call it gout.
Follow your skill in treating the disease so that the plague in your care does not become worse; do not add any violence to it, nor let anyone be arrogant or malicious; for when it is applied to the root of the disease, it corrupts that and brings about its downfall, and brings harm to the patient at the same time.
When applied to the head, as is when bones are softened and the disease is less severe, it is black on the surface of the head; therefore consider that if it causes harm to the patient, the same applies when applied to the body, as it is perilous in every way
And if it does not cause blackening of the medicine that is being used, but only from the medicine itself, know that it is in virtue of that medicine that produces that blackness; therefore take a little of the medicine and mix it with three parts of olive oil and mix with these lines a salve, and place that over the head; and care for that which is appropriate for the treatment that you consider suitable for recovery.</end_turn>
Chapter 3.
On the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.</end_turn>
Know that the nose is not fractured but merely bent downwards, or one of the two bones is slightly displaced, so that there are two bones remaining, of which one is cartilaginous and is not fractured, but is swollen and painful, without fracture.</end_turn
May be one of the two bones is fractured, however, know that you must insert a little of the aforementioned unguent into the ditch of the nose, and soften that fracture as much as possible, and as much as the force of the fracture allows, until the nose returns to its natural shape.</end_turn And be vigilant in this matter, and keep that you do not cause further pain to the patient during the operation.</end_turn
And if the fracture is in the more prominent part of the nose, and you say that it is not so, know that it is equal to the tip of the ray in which the thickness is small.</end_turn
And if the fracture is in two bones, do the same for them.</end_turn
Close the restoration of the nose in the first day of the fracture if possible; otherwise, keep it still for six days or until the swelling has subsided.</end_turn
And put on the tip of the nose a plaster bandage, if the fracture is in one part, or two caloses if the fracture is in two parts, and the thickness of the caloses should be such as to fill the cavity of the nose.</end_turn
Tell the former restorers that the caloses must be bound on the edges and be changed every day, even if I am not told; because it must be covered with album soaked in warm water with powdered charcoal.
There are some who say that the nostrils should be filled with lead instead of the caloses, for they are more flexible; and that the fracture of the nose is more violent and that the pain is not prohibited from inspiration.</end_turn
This is not necessary for you; if you wish, do the one thing, or do the other.</end_turn
And if another ointment is added to the ointment, plaster the nose with cerate or egg whites diluted in wine vinegar and olive oil, or with diaquilon.</end_turn
If the ointment does not cause swelling, know that you must plaster the outside with flour of wheat and powdered lavender with wet album; and place a sponge over it, and do not put the nose in any way.</end_turn
If the bones of the nose are fractured with a small fracture or broken, know that you must dissect over those, and extract those with instruments that are suitable for those; and close the incision, and care for that which encloses and consolidates, and plaster as convenient.</end_turn
And if there is a plague inside the nose, know that you must care for that with caloses and administer lead canulas until it is completely healed.</end_turn
Chapter 4.</end_turn
From restoration of the mandible when fractured.
When the jawbone is fractured and the fracture is not displaced, recovery is quicker if the fracture is only slightly displaced, and is not completely fractured through and through, but is bent outwards at the edges
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; in the same way, if the fracture is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand; and press on both sides of the fracture outwards at the same time, with your other hand on the opposite side of the fracture
And if the fracture of the jawbone has already been separated into two, cover that you administer extension of two parts according to the rule until it is possible to equal them
And if there is movement of teeth with disruption, cover those that you expect to remain fixed with gold or silver or ivory; and place your hand over the fractured jawbone close to the ear, and place your hand over the duplicated tooth, and place your hand over the great wisdom tooth appropriately made, or a piece of cloth equal in length to the jaw; and tie that away as much as is necessary for the application to take effect, until it is not destroyed.
Command the patient to rest and tranquility, and abstain from eating spicy foods
And if you see that the figure has already been altered in any way, cover that you will remove it on the third day; and then rectify what has already been altered of it and plaster over it with powdered meal, with egg white, or with oatmeal, because you must not leave it open, and place your hand over the plaster bandage
And when the annex is fixed and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it in peace, do not remove it until it is healed and strengthen the fracture; for many people see this fracture stretched in three months.
And if another person comes with a subsequent swelling after this, cover that you must do what we have said about the treatment in the quiet of the place until it is healed, and remove that swelling
And if the fracture is displaced, cover that you must consider if it is a fracture of the separated bone or saturages, cover that you must order the removal of those saturages when convenient for the disappearance of those from the pangs.
And if the wound of the fracture is wide, cover that you must widen it with the flebotomy according to the quantity of your need
And when you have finished removing those saturages, and of those you will not remove, cover that you must close the wound of the fracture if it is wide; and if not, place your hand over one of the bandages that you consider convenient and secure that.

From restoration of the jaw when fractured.
When the jawbone is fractured on the side of the teeth towards the back of the mouth due to the muscle, and that fracture is caused by one of three things.
Or it is fractured, or separated, or it is separated into two parts without causing saturages; and it is necessary for the restoration of it; or it is that there has been a displacement of saturages, and it is difficult to restore it; or that the fracture is wide
And the operation in this case, when the fracture is wide, is that you must have two assistants, so that one can hold the fractured jaw and the other can extend the cheek of that side
And cover the fracture with the index fingers until the shape is restored according to what we have said, neither too taut nor too concave
And if you order more extension, cover that you must stop leaving the patient's chin on the edge of the table or on the table, and be the size of it according to the quantity of your need; and extend and elevate the jaw and cover the wound with your hand until you have closed the fracture as we have said
And if you are unable to withdraw the jawbone to the outside, in order to reach the root, cover that the patient should be supine on his neck, and place your hand over the muscle of his face on one side.
And the minister will draw the muscle of the face towards the outside until the jawbone is elevated more than it is in the root, and then you will rectify the fracture and cover it with the index fingers
Even if there are saturages of the jaw and these are soft, cover that you must work over that and extract those saturages easily
If it is retained in the bone, then you generate incision of it with one of the instruments which you have prepared for this, because you had left behind the spur that served the scapula; and that spur is of bone or iron of which this is the form.
It is similar to the one of which this is the cavity; and its breadth as much as you need it, according to the size of the bone or the thinness of it.
May the length of it be as much as is possible for the operation; that there be two extremities thus sometimes, and one broad and the other narrow
And if the disruption of the membrane which you have incised when you have extracted the marrow from the bone is wide, and you are sure of the haemostasis, then you adjust the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the disruption is slight, or you fear haemostasis, then you use the wound with gauze and powder according to the extent of the wound
And if haemostasis fails, then immerse the wound in wine vinegar and olive oil and wine, and rest upon it
And indeed, that the splint should not be left on the fractured bone; and so that you see the patient every day, because when the ligament is softened or the splint is already remoulded, then you must rectify that and strengthen the bandage.
And so keep the patient still on the foot, and keep the tingling of the foot from disturbing him during the night, putting a small cushion under his foot; for so will be elevated the assistant of the foot from the heel of the foot to the elevation of the scapula; or that the arm of the foot is bound to the heel of the foot.
Do not remove the bandage if there is no bleeding or haematoma, within twelve days.
And so renew the plaster if you have seen the face of the wound to it, and adjust in the stiffness and restore that and leave until it is restored and the fracture of the scapula is consolidated
And it is strengthened and comforted according to the month in xxviii days, and a few days in some homes is sufficient in the month of that time.
Chapter VI
On the restoration of the fracture of the scapula.
The scapula is fractured in the lateral part of the bone and is not fractured from the bone except for the margins
And therefore when it is fractured in the middle of the bone – and it is fractured in the middle of the bone – and is not known except by touch, then according as the figure of the fracture forces you to prepare it and reduce that according to the natural figure in every way that is possible to you
And so keep over the area powdered wheat flour and egg white and stop bleeding; and keep double powder of wax; and keep over that a splint of oak about the whole extent of the spatula or more if necessary
May the hole left by the scapula be concaved in some of the parts of the spatula, then you englobe that concavity with a stop of lion, and put the splint equal to the height of the scapula
And so strengthen from below with nourishment long enough with constriction downward and with support of the splint until it is not remoulded from the marrow of the bone
Consider the ligament every day; and whenever it is softened, leave another day and strengthen it and equal the splint to the height of the scapula if it is remoulded from the marrow of the bone
And keep the patient still on the lateral side of his foot
The scapula is restored in xx days or in .xxv
Therefore, when this number has been completed, you dissolve the ligament, and you know with certainty that that which originates from the bones from which you began will not be feared or dissolved.
And if you proceed from the area of the heel and put down the tendon, then you split over it, and leave it, and do as we have said concerning the fracture of the collarbone after excision of the cartilage of the heel

When several veins are cut in the middle of the foot and these are somewhat torn; however, the extremities of the foot must not be torn so that they are cicatrized and diminished.</end_of_turn
And concerning the accidents of these veins when the middle of the foot is fractured, that it declines to the surrounding parts and causes great pain, difficulty in walking, sneezing, vomiting, and strong pain; and is declared in the cavity of the fractured bone and is not hidden from the feeling.</end_of_turn
And the restoration of these is that you rest the patient on his side, and put between his buttocks a cushion; and immediately bind the muscles of the foot, and adjust the ribs of the foot to the greatest of two ribs, and bring together the lower part of the body in the operation of the foot and in the equalization as much as is possible and as is convenient, until you have returned the limb to its normal position.</end_of_turn
And immediately pause on the plaster and bandage and pause over the wound a soft cushion of gauze or cloth and keep them in suspension; for you must cover that with a bandage. And immediately bind that over the fractured bone so that it is not painful; and keep that bind tight without being too tight. And consider the bind always, and when it is softened, tighten that one again.
And if necessary to provoke a loosening of that you must perform excision or drainage or pain, or swelling that occurs in the area, then you cover it and remove that bandage and remove the plaster and rectify what has happened in that way; and immediately reduce the plaster, sometimes up to the face; and adjust the bind until it is healed.</end_of_turn

On the restoration of the vertebrae when they are fractured.</end_of_turn
You must know that a fracture of the vertebrae does not cause paralysis except in the places where two lie together; and concerning the extremities of the parts from the front do not cause to those behind except for the fact that the cartilaginous ones are fractured.</end_of_turn And as for the recognition of these it is not hidden from the feeling, you must inquire about it from those who know.</end_of_turn
And the restoration is just as much as embraces the fracture as said above, except that it is embraced as much as is possible, and immediately plaster and strengthen the fractured bone with a splint, if it does not impede that.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture of the vertebrae declines to the surrounding parts it causes acute pain and puncture, just like a puncture that occurs to that which has pleuracy, and for that reason it puts the bone in a limp; and it causes difficulty in walking, sneezing, vomiting quite seriously; and this is of difficult healing.</end_of_turn
And already the ancients have invented in that way that does not move.</end_of_turn
And from them it is said: cover that you feed the patient of the disease that caused inflammation and swelling, so that the belly is flattened and extended, and the fracture is not hindered by the parts outside.</end_of_turn
However we must beware of that so that it does not be the cause of generating further swelling by means of the cautery, if not to happen; and if it has already happened, the hour has already helped to that.</end_of_turn
And I say to you that it is stopped without wind and that you should make it with force; and it is like reasoning, however, it is feared that the wind will tear the parts to the area for the fracture.</end_of_turn
And I say to you: cover that the area be covered with wool that has already been immersed in oil caut, and stay powdered between the vertebrae until it is full, that the bind be equal when you wrap that up according to the retuning; and immediately cure the patient of the disease with food and medicine.</end_of_turn
And if it causes acute constriction of the patient that does not suffer from it, and puts the bone in a limp with puncture, you must take care of the patient, for the hour covers that they should break over the area, uncover the fractured edge, and immediately stop that instrument that is retained, remembering that which is preceded is followed, and that it facilitates the bone, and extract that.</end_of_turn
And thus we shall adjust the two lips of the plague, if it is great, with pressure, and we shall care for that which is not plastered until it is healed.
And if it happens that the swelling is deep, then thou shalt uncover and bathe the area with oil of roses and place your hand over the place, and that the patient be cured by the warmth which covers the swelling deep
And let the patient rest upon the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed
End of session.
Restoration of the fracture of the vertebra of the two and of the tailbone.
Certain wounds cause fracture to the bones of the tailbone, and the treatment is to leave them alone, and to be similar to the vertebrae of the two And when such things happen to some people and one wishes to know if he is healed or not, then consider that sometimes the limbs are already softened and relaxed and softened and dead and one cannot make them move or extend or flex them, and when you constrain them with tight bands or pierce them with needles and they do not feel pain in them, then you know that he is not healed, and in such a state of affairs it is deadly.
And if you make them move and press in their constriction with bands or pierce them, then you know that the bone is saved and that the disease will be healed with care
And if you see the vertebrae of the tailbone like this and you wish to know if he is healed or not, then consider the feet of the patient
Then if sometimes they are already softened, this happens in the most serious cases, and when he lies over the two thighs, he is unable to urinate, and many times he is found resting over the two thighs and is unable to urinate, then you know that it is deadly, and do not work on his care
Maybe if no other cause of these exists, the cause is better and lighter
And the care of them is that you perforate the swelling with the cautery and that you place over the vertebra which is fractured oil of roses alone, or with soft sponges of wax; and place over that anyone who has seen a wound to give him until the swelling is reduced.
And let one of the attendants loosen one of the plaster supports which exist and hold over that which is fractured; and command the patient to rest and be tranquil and not to sleep on the side on which he feels pain until he is healed
And if it happens that the swelling arises from the sacrum or any other cause that has already been separated from it, then you must cover that area with a dressing and support that bone; and then adjust the two lips of the plague, with sutures if it is great; and take care of that which is not plastered until it is healed
Maybe if the heel bone is fractured and the end of the limb is stiff, then you must put your left hand on the buttock and grasp the fractured bone with the other hand as well as is possible; and then support over that plaster and bandage, if you think it necessary; and hold that position
And if the sacrum is fractured in them, then you must sit over that, and hold that, and take care of the plague with the care which is proper until it is healed
End of session.
Restoration of the limb
The bones of the limb have become fractured, and if they break, then the fracture of them is nothing but a communication in the extremities of those and are inscribed in the length and decline to the inward; and it happens to the patient pain in the place and puncture, and the limb is stupefied when it is fractured
And the restoration of them is that you extend your hand over that which is over the fracture which is like the figure of it
And if the fracture is only at the extremity of the limb, then you must grasp that as it is appropriate until it is reassembled to its natural figure
Maybe if the fracture is in the middle or that it already declines to the inward of the thighs, then you must make the patient lie on his belly until he is prepared for the restoration of that fracture And when that has been grasped, support over that plaster, and hold over that bandage of cloth or bandage, and hold firmly over that which you fear puncture of fracture or loosening of the staple.
And grasp the cavity with oil which is under that which supports the staple according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on the two thighs or to rest on the side of the wound
May it be that if an apoplexy occurs due to the cautery, cease the extension of the limb and its restoration until the apoplexy has subsided; then rest upon it what is necessary until that which precedes it has passed away; and then return to the restoration of the limb, and strengthen it as before.
And if it happens in the heel bones or are crumbled, then treat them as well
Chapter eleven
On the restoration of the fracture of the adjuvant bone
The adjuvant is that which is between the hip bone and the head of the femur
And if it is fractured, the restoration of it is in two ways, of which one is to take half of the great trochanter by this method:
And join at two extremities two ligaments, and suspend it from the elevated place.
And follow the patient upon a cushion; and put the fractured limb outside over the hip until it reaches the nail of the limb at the middle place where the curvature of the limb is attached
And if there is any other serious cause, or a minor extend the limb to the lower parts; and the doctor should keep the fracture firm in the joints until the fracture returns as it should
The other way is that the patient be supine on the cervical spine and suspend the limb from the collarbone; and command two assistants to take hold of what is below the fracture on their sides; and the other to hold the legs; and whichever of them extends to their part
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then strengthen over the fracture with the ligament and over that with the other ligament, and whichever of the two assistants extends to two of their parts
Therefore if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, cover that half of the ligament over the nail and the other leave the fracture outside the hipbone
Similarly if the fracture is close to the hipbone, cover that half of the ligament over that place and over that hipbone
Moisturize what is facilitated and work thus; and when it has been moistened as it should be according to the cover and the application, then strengthen that which does not cause an apoplexy after the cautery.
May it be that if an apoplexy occurs due to the cautery, leave the restriction until the seventh day, and rest upon it a soft bandage soaked in vinegar and olive oil until the apoplexy has subsided, and then strengthen that again
The way to strengthen that is to put on a plaster cast over the fracture, and then put on a bandage of lint over the plaster cast; and adjust the arm over that adjuvant and put your open hand over the thigh muscle
And rest the limb and strengthen over the adjuvant the arm so that the arm is in place without hindering any other cause of the fractured bone.
And use crutches
And rest upon the fracture that which is stronger and firmer than the others; and rest between each stick the width of a finger, and the length of the sticks according to the fracture in addition to three fingers from the whole part
And strengthen over the sticks at the restriction which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter
And that your restriction over the place of the fracture be more straight And when the fracture is more prolonged, the restriction should be less strong
Therefore if sometimes the position of the sticks and the restriction as we have said at the hour when you restore the limb to its usual position, then do so
And if you fear an apoplexy due to the cautery, then leave the restriction and the sticks until the seventh day as we have said before
And consider the ligament in all parts for three days so that it does not happen in the place of bruising or swelling; or it is prohibited to feed the limb to prevent excess stiffness; and therefore rectify all that has been said above
May it be that if you are confident that no other cause will occur, do not remove the bandage until three days or more have passed
And let the patient rest on the side of the patient two, and the greater parts over the stomach
Pause over the injured limb completely covered in fat, and consider throughout the night or day that it is not swollen or dissolved, or that the ligament is softened, therefore rectify all of this with your skill.
Pause the food of the patient according to the order which we have given before, namely that the food should be subtle at the beginning until it is well chewed; and that the time that has elapsed since the food was eaten should be covered
As for the custom of the attendants and the chambermaid, it is that they should be strong for forty days; and that the time that has elapsed since their last meal should be covered by bathing and medication, which correct that.
And if the fracture is late, then do not delay with the ligament and the bones for a day or two months.

Restoration of forearm fracture.
The forearm consists of two bones which are called the ulna and the radius; of which the one is small, and that is that which is called the thumb, and the other is large and that is that which is grasped from behind the thumb, from the part beyond the thumb
And it is strong that only the large or the small bone is fractured, or that both are fractured together
And when the small bone is fractured, then the restoration of it is light, and the healing is easier.
And when the large bone is fractured behind the thumb, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult
And the worse of all is when both bones are fractured together
Therefore, if the bone that is fractured is the small one outside, it is convenient for the doctor to delay the restoration, that is to say, to keep the small extension facilitated until that which has been fractured is healed
Even if the large bone is fractured, it is necessary to keep the extension still more violent
And if both bones are fractured together, it is necessary to keep the movement of the limb still more strong
And you must keep the figure of the hand still during the restoration of the limb and the extension of the limb supported on a cushion, and that the thumb should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be placed in the center of the cushion
And give the patient a cushion under the arm or the side of the limb, so that the patient does not suffer pain.
Then the attendants extend the arm from the part beyond the thumb with the right hand or the ligament, and another attendant extends the rest of the limb like that
And the doctor should join the bone as soon as possible, until it has returned to its normal position.
And if there is swelling of the bone, then you must perforate the whole area of the wound with your skill
And if there appears a separate swelling that does not please you with the restoration of the limb, then you must take it out and remain with it as we have said before
And if the fracture is in the palm of the hand, I have already spoken about this particular case, and therefore take care of that
And if by chance you should happen to burn the cautery at the beginning of your restoration, then you should line up a bandage around the wound with castor oil and white wax, and mix between spirits and subtlety, and stretch the bandage tightly over that which is stricture subtle until the burn is gone; and then keep the bandage and pause the plaster prepared from powdered rosin with clay and oil, and place the thumb; and let the thumb be stronger and stronger than before.
And you know that the number of bones in the forearm is six, or that the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together
And keep your stricture tight over the fracture site more strongly and more violently, and when more if you withdraw the stricture from the upper parts of the fracture or from the lower parts of the limb, pause the stricture a little more soft than before according to the memory of the fracture from the beginning of this chapter
And the cloths that cover the fracture should be wet cloths, and should not be dry or rough, and the thread with which it is sutured should be neither too fine nor too thick, as we have recommended
Consider the limb and the ligament for about a few days. If any other cause compels correction, immediately do the same for the member affected, and while you are doing so, cover the limb with warm water until the pain ceases.
Keep the limb still until the swelling subsides, and then return the structure to its normal position.
If the swelling has already been softened and the bone is already softened and similar to those, then restore everything to its original condition with your skill
Consider whether nutrition is prohibited from reaching the limb due to excessive swelling, for in that case cover that until the swelling subsides, and then restore the nutrition to it again, and strengthen that.
If no other cause of the aforementioned has occurred, then do not cause it to go away for about xx days or more
And suspend the patient's hand from their movement with their skill, and let them sleep on their side two.</start_of_turn>

And when the thumb is fractured or broken, or if there is a tear, then cover the patient so that they do not move, and keep their hand still over the extended limb.</start_of_turn
And the minister extends the broken bones, and the doctor joins them back together until they are well united with good adhesion.</start_of_turn
And keep the plaster still and stop, if necessary; do not do so carelessly; and keep the bandage still according to the amount of the wound, and you have already covered that with linen.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is in the palm of the hand, you must hold the palm of the hand from moving, and order the patient to strengthen that which has been fractured; strengthen it with a long bandage.</start_of_turn
And keep the limb resting on the bandage in which it is lifted, so that the limb is applied to the palm; and strengthen it as much as is necessary.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is on the outside of the limb, then keep the limb still from the outside and another from the inside of the palm, so that the hand is open and extended; and strengthen the structure, even if the hand is rotated between the fingers and the thumb.</start_of_turn
And if there is a fracture of some of the fingers, if it is said to be serious, keep it united as it should be, and strengthen it with the palm, and if you wish, bind the little finger tightly so that the fracture is elevated and not crushed.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the ring, middle, index, or thumb, keep them united and bound together as a whole; or bind them all together in sequence, which is better; or keep them bound over that little bandage as we have said before.</start_of_turn

On the restoration of the fracture of the thigh bone.</start_of_turn
The bone of the thigh is broken with soft moats, and is declared to be converted to the front part and to the greater trochanter.</start_of_turn
And the restoration of it is made so that the ligament is strengthened over the fracture and another ligament of the outside of the fracture, and the patient is placed prone on the belly and on the face.</start_of_turn
And the minister extends all the ligament to its part according to the quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.</start_of_turn
If it is at the hip, then keep the ligament of the trochanter to the pubic bone at the fifth space, so that the limb is extended, and the other ligament of the outside of the fracture.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is close to the nail, then it is necessary to ligate the fracture close to the nail, and extend the fracture to the lower parts.
And the doctor should gently move the limb both above and below until the fracture is reduced according to its natural conformation; then cover with a bandage and keep it still, unless an accident happens to the limb later If an accident happens to it later, then leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides, and then return to your care
The bandage of the fracture should be tight: cover the fracture with a hard bandage, and bend the limb two or three times, and remove excess air; and then cover the limb until it reaches the ankle and the heel of the foot
And insert a long thread between the thigh and the foot near the nail, and bring the ends of the thread over the limb above and below the fracture, and tie a knot over the limb and the thigh as much as the bandage allows
And keep your thigh still at the level of the fracture, and place a splint over the limb of the fracture
And fill the space between the limb and the thigh with soft cloths, so that the swelling is absorbed
And start to tighten the bandage firmly around the area of the fracture with three wraps or four, and when you have advanced around the fracture site, reduce the tightening and make it lighter and softer
And extend the two ends of the thread to the lower parts until it reaches the ankle, and strengthen both ends of the nails on the other side so that the nail is not pulled out of place
And keep the limb still in this way, so that no accident happens to the limb during healing or swelling does not occur or that the fracture does not worsen; and if any of these things happen, immediately suspend the treatment and rectify what has happened as soon as possible, as we have said before
If the bone is very painful, then it is necessary to ligate that as soon as possible; and if not, leave it alone and care for what has happened before, until it is healed.
The doctor should adjust the fracture of the thigh so that it is aligned with the nails, as we have said in the instructions and in the book.
However, in the restoration of the limb in this way does not cause the patient to limp; and if it is restored alone, without applying the other bandage, it is necessary that the other limb be clamped as well
Remember that the thigh is strengthened in thirty days or a few months or a few weeks, according to the diversity of the conditions and the other provisions

Remember that the fracture of the thigh bone is often delayed, but it does not happen without the application of these cloths externally.
If an accident happens to the fracture, it is not anything more than a fissure or crack in the limb, and this is accompanied by swelling or bruising, and about this one must be silent
The restoration of the limb is when it is ligated as much as is possible so that it is reunited and joined as soon as possible for the greatest ease and comfort and convenience.</end_of_turn>

The same thing happens with the various types of fractures that occur in both bones of the limb, and for this reason the restoration of the limb is as much as possible like the restoration of the limb itself, and the operation is one.</end_of_turn
If two bones are fractured together, the limb is converted into its entirety.
If two bones are fractured together, the limb is converted into its entirety.
If two bones are fractured together, the limb is converted into its entirety. The other limb is usually affected, and this is the cause of your pain.
And give extension, equilibrium and ligature of the bones according to that equilibrium
Moreover, if the fracture of the limb is slight without having soft swelling, make the extension milder and lighter, and relieve with your skill.</start_of_turn>
And in the limb is any cause of operation on the hand, and it is when you have gathered the fragments and when you have completed your surgical work, then you will take pins of glass from the foot which is placed outside the causes which are placed inside, and so make them sufficient but not excessive; give them the size that suits the limb, and from the nail inwards.</start_of_turn>
And cover with two covers each part according to its length, and place one over the part of the limb from one side and the other over the part of the limb from the other side, and so from the nail inwards of the foot.</start_of_turn
And tie the two fragments in three places at the two extremities and in the middle part, so that the limb is prohibited from leaning to the right and left, and remains in a good position.</start_of_turn
And a bandage of glass is administered according to the length of the limb; and keep the limb still in it so that it conserves that movement.</start_of_turn
More importantly, cover what is fractured well, and when that is properly placed.</start_of_turn

And if there is a fracture in the bones of the foot, and sometimes when these bones must be elevated between them, then you must put the foot on the ground prepared as when going out.</start_of_turn
And put a foot on what is elevated from those bones, and then chalk them, and press and bind them until they are healed in the places.</start_of_turn
And put on plaster and stop discharge, and keep the belly of the foot a little wider than the two caps of glass.</start_of_turn
And strengthen that which has been straightened, because you have covered that with bandage and other causes which you do not indicate.</start_of_turn
And when three or four days have passed, then you will remove the bandage, because you will find the bones healed, or fractured or dislocated, and the operation in these is like that of a cunning man.</start_of_turn
Moreover, if some of the toes are fractured, then restore these and bind them as before. And keep the fractured toe steady according to the length of the toe, and make it a little wider; and keep the foot on this table which has been recommended to you, and strengthen that which has been straightened downwards.</start_of_turn
Moreover, if there are two or three or more fractures, then you must keep each toe still according to its quantity covered in soft leather, and strengthen the table at the bottom of the foot, and stand on one of the ends of the table to keep the foot in good retention.</start_of_turn

When the thigh bone is fractured, then the pain ceases in its usual place and it inclines towards the part two inches below the knee.
When the thigh bone is fractured, then the mother must fill the thigh with wine; and make a point on the thigh in the same way as before; and elevate the two little bones below until all that is outside is forgotten until the part of the thigh which is below the knee has returned to its normal place.</end_of_turn>
And place powder on the two little bones, and when you wish to urinate, the cushion is facilitated and the urine will flow; and reduce and return that which was previously mentioned according to the manner in which it was commenced, and place the powder away once more.</end_of_turn>
And do thus for seven days or until recovery occurs.</end_of_turn>
Or if you wish, take once of vinegar and strengthen over the knee a tube of sponge; and draw out all the urine from the bladder into the thigh, and then close the tube so that the bladder is compressed until the fracture returns.</end_of_turn
And keep the thigh filled with wine for several days as we have recommended, until recovery.</end_of_turn>
When the thigh bone or the shin bone is fractured, then administer in the restoration and swelling of them the things that we have recommended for the ankle bone.</end_of_turn>
And what is hidden in these primary fractures is not concealed in them and little debt is to be expected, mostly to that one to whom it is some study and who understands this book well; for that fracture means to you in the greatest possibilities of restoration and stricture of them, and therefore understand well.</end_of_turn>
More when the thigh is fractured, take vinegar and mustard, and put the mustard in that; and put a cover over them and cover them, and keep it covered for three days or until recovery occurs, and be healed.</end_of_turn

Of the restoration of fractures of the bones when swelling is present.</end_of_turn
It is convenient in that to which an accident of fracture with swelling has happened, and more so if the bone is great as for example the bone of the thigh or the bone of the forearm, or is similar to these, that you take care of it and apply poultices to it as much as possible even if the symptoms of inflammation are at your ease or as they are reported to you.</end_of_turn
And if the swelling subsides, cover that you keep to the retention of the liquid which you have powdered over it if for another reason it is not present.</end_of_turn
And begin to restore the fracture in that way on the eighth day, and do not prolong it, if not after an apostem.</end_of_turn
More if an apostem occurs, then leave the restoration of them until the ninth day, until the apostem has subsided, and do not approach them on the third day and the fourth of the whole thing, for you will make them happen worse.</end_of_turn
More if the fractured bone is prominent over the knee, cover that you perforate to reduce it and equalize it with your hands as much as possible and with little extension.</end_of_turn
More if the extension is not prepared for you and the equilibrium of them with your thighs is not at your convenience, then you reduce that with your hands as much as possible and with little discomfort; and that discomfort is useful for iron, the length of which is seven inches or eight and the width is according to the quantity of the swelling; and for this it is necessary for the physician to take into consideration these three or four things according to the quantity that you indicate in the treatment of every kind of fracture.</end_of_turn
And be round, and be in little height so that it is not doubled over by the pressure in the time of the operation.</end_of_turn
And be of acute extremity to which it is close in the limbs; and be the distance from it to the great toe bent, and from the middle to the heel.</end_of_turn
This is the form of them.</end_of_turn
And it is called in Greek “labre volentz atelarem”, so it is little pale.</end_of_turn
For that cover that the acute extremity is raised over the prominent limb.</end_of_turn
And put it in a bandage until the bone returns, and be equalized with any equilibrium.</end_of_turn
Therefore strive to stabilize the fractured limb between them, and if the limb is fractured slightly and does not cause them undue discomfort, then it is sufficient to insert the limb into the surrounding tissue that has the power to hold it in place.
Even if you are unable to reduce the bone entirely as we have recommended, it is sufficient to suffice with that which covers the injuries from the surrounding tissues which we have mentioned; or bind that with one of the nails in any way that you are able.</end_of_turn>
And take away that which remains in the bone of swelling and small wounds.</end_of_turn>
When the bone is reduced, and the patient experiences severe pain, it is known that the bone has not been returned to its natural position; whereupon you must do what you can to comfort the patient greatly.</end_of_turn
When the restoration of the limb is complete, which is done to the bone, then immerse the wound in black vinegar, especially if it is summer, and do not put any oil on the wound, for this causes it to soften and decay.</end_of_turn
And immediately administer sponges at the time of eating in addition to the restoration of the limb, and leave the wound uncovered until the wound has been closed with sutures and dressing as required according to the extent of the wound.</end_of_turn
Be very careful not to strain the wound at the fracture, for this is what often causes the physicians to lose their patients, and it will cause great suffering to the patient if it is delayed or if it is done carelessly.</end_of_turn And if the fracture is slight and soft, unlike the fracture of other bones.</end_of_turn>
If the wound is large or if there is suspicion of a severe accident to those bones which we have recommended, and if there is pain in the area, then do not put on any sutures, but rather apply a bandage of fine cloth in place of the sutures and tighten it around them.</end_of_turn
When two or three days have passed since the wound began to heal, if there is swelling in it, then remove the vinegar which you had placed on it, and administer calamine, which is customary for healing wounds, along with any other medications that you deem appropriate.</end_of_turn
Advise the patient to keep the limb still and consider the wound every morning and evening until it is consolidated and firm, and that the limb is prepared in such a way that the swelling subsides from it to the lower parts without difficulty.</end_of_turn
If several days have passed since the wound appeared and it is neither consolidated nor has it been evacuated, then it is known that there is a delay in healing and that the wound should be treated with attention.</end> And if those delays which are separated remain and are extruded, those which are not separated and cause the limb to swell and cause pain, you must order that they be excised as soon as possible.</end>
If gangrene or decay occurs in the wound, this is a sign of severe infection, or other kind of corruption and decay, and in such a case you must immediately suspend any treatment which has preceded this narration in the capital.</end>
And if the limb is grossly fractured, examine the limb as you would the limb of a cripple or a helper, and take precautions as you would for the great limbs, and do not presume that the attraction of the limb will be enough, or that the extraction of the limb which often happens will not cause death; but rather leave it in place until it recovers naturally, which will take approximately twenty or thirty days.</end And if you are able to cure the wound, leave it alone; if not, leave it as it is.</end
Chapter 20.</end>
On the treatment of swelling which occurs in the aftermath of any fracture.
These swellings often accompany the healing of fractures, and are especially common in the vicinity of the joints, and often hinder the natural functioning of the limb.
Therefore consider if the swelling is recent and administer medicines which have a constrictive action so that it is less painful, and look, and touch, and inspect the limb in every way, and if you see or feel anything abnormal, take some or all of them away, and mix them with vinegar or album of herbs, or with vinegar and oil, and cover the swelling with this until it subsides, and bind it tightly around it.</end_of_turn>
Leave the extraction until it has been at least a few days; and if you extract it, repeat the procedure until the swelling has disappeared; or bind the limb tightly with leaden tape, which has the property of reducing swelling in limbs.</end_of_turn
May it be that if he has already become petrified and stretched, and necessity compels him to cause pain in that manner, then split that part most sovereignly of him, and puncture the superfluous or eminent, or withdraw that which is at the root of the cause until it is remaugued; and care for that which remains until it is healed.
The provided text is in a medieval medical treatise written in a language that resembles Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. Here is a translation:
In the restoration of a fracture when it is restored and then immediately the limb should be kept flexible not following its natural movement.
When a bone fracture has been restored, and then immediately the limb should be kept flexible, for in these cases there are several causes for this: one is the multitude of solution of the ligament and the tightening of the limb which has been made in vain; or for the excess of stricture of the ligaments that the nourishment is prohibited from running to the limb; or for the multitude of superfluous embrocation; or for an abnormal movement that is not in its time; or for the scarcity of health in the body of the patient and for the weakness of his limbs
The care of this is to feed the patient and make him drink until his health is multiplied in him; to administer baths; and to give him poultices and let him know about them.
And immediately put a bandage over the limb, so that the bandage does not obstruct the running of the nourishment, or continues to embrocate it with lukewarm water, until the nourishment returns to its natural figure
End of document.
Regarding the care of fractured bones when they are restored tortiously and prohibits the operation of them by means of liquid that covers them.
When an accident happens to a limb that has already been restored, immediately restore its stability and remove any prominence of the fractured bone and nodulation, for this may cause the limb not to recover naturally, however it does not mean that you must refrain from any treatment for that limb just because it has been fractured before
Indeed there are many fools among the doctors and restorers who have made use of us in our time; and this treatment is not without great fear, for the signal of which is mortal
If the swelling and nodulation are recent, then immediately bathe them in lukewarm water in which are dissolved many cooling herbs such as fennel and rue, marjoram, and chamomile; or apply a plaster with a soothing plaster such as that of gypsum; or that of olive oil with beeswax or honey, or that of lead and beeswax or pine resin, or that of fat and linseed oil and poppy seed, like those that are not foreign to the physician after consolidation.
And many times the swelling is dissolved with continuous rubbing of the limb that is even in the most humid seasons, and movement of the limb must be administered in every hour throughout the day
If the torsions have already gone down and force has been applied, and it has become petrified and is caused by necessity, care must be taken of it with iron, for the most part of the pus that is expelled from the nodule of that member must be dissolved, and the movement of the limb must be facilitated in that which the os is solicited and studied

Concerning dislocation
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint of the limb, because it is prohibited from movement, and causes deformity of the limb, and brings about great pain and lesions in the patient
Therefore, when an accident of dislocation occurs, it must be treated as soon as possible so that it is reduced, and not to delay that reduction, for if it is delayed, the limb is apostematized and strong, and it is difficult to reduce the dislocation
And to prevent this it must not be grasped or stretched at the time of reduction, for many herbs make spasm and pain worse
When an accident happens, the limb must be kept calm and relaxed, and immediately put into a cold bath of oil and water; and must be reduced with the greatest possible ease
And all the limb must be treated with the water from which the memory will remain in its place
And I have already ordered the chapters of dislocation according to their order, from the most superior part of the body to the most inferior part

So dislocadas the two mandibles if they are not held firmly; and dislocation of both is usual in two ways: that they are loosely fixed in their places by little movement, or that they are completely dislocated and complete, until they are softened at the juncture until saliva from the patient comes out of its mouth and does not wish to have that or to close its mouth, and its tongue is wrapped in its saliva
May be when the dislocation is slight, the hour in the greatest disposition returns by itself without much cause.
May be if the dislocation is complete and complicated, the hour commands that it be urgently reduced, and not be delayed at all.
And it is that the minister has the head of the patient, and the doctor puts his thumb of his right hand on the root of the dislocation of the mandible in front of the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is of the right side; or that he puts his two thumbs together inside, if the dislocation is of both sides, and that the others say from the most of the patient that they are out of it; and commands the patient to stop his mandibles and hold those that do not touch; and the doctor grasps the mandible and covers the mandible until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both mandibles are simultaneously dislocated, the hour administers evaporation with cold water and oil, until it is useful to lighten the reduction of both and not to delay the reduction of both for too long, as we have said
And thus when they return and are softened, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, the hour pauses over those little threads of silk at the corners, and is useful with wax and oil rubbed; and it is placed so that it is fixed with ease.
And let the patient sleep on his two thighs, and his head be between two cushions, so that neither side is hurt; and do not force him to do anything more; have the patient's bed be firm, until when the pains are relieved and the mandibles are well aligned, the hour may leave when it wants.
And what is administered with ease, and do not work on the opening of the patient's mouth during eating and drinking and talking, until the mandible is relaxed and healed
And if the reduction of two mandibles is difficult when they are dislocated at any hour and is not converted to their normal places, the hour moves with haste fever and salt solution, and it is very urgent to be warned the patient's belly, and it is very strong and vomiting pure bile.
And when it is repeated often, the hour knows that it is for loss; and it moves away from that to which it happened within a few days.

Of the reduction of the dislocation of the breastbone and of the extremity of the muscle.
The breastbone is not dislocated from the side because of its continuity with the feet; and some are dislocated at the far end, and that is known by the feeling.
And the restoration of them is that the patient grasps over the two thighs and extends his upper limbs. And immediately cover the area with your palm with strong pressure, so that it will return.
And immediately pause over that plaster and threads and hold that.
May the extremity of the limb that was previously bitten and is continued with that, not be dislocated at any time; the hour commands that it be reduced and softened as we have said and as you have said concerning your treatment
And immediately pause over that plaster, threads and traction, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until it is healed.
And in this same method of treatment the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from the bone
Capital .xxvi.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle
You know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the heel to the toes
And the second is that it is dislocated from below the muscle, and that is useful; it is not dislocated at the back for the shoulder; and it is not dislocated at the front for the nerves
The greatest displacement is that of the cartilages that are outside of their sockets, especially in those where the tissue is thin, and most of all in those where there are many bones, for it is outside with difficulty.
And often it happens by percussion or violent movement of the limb, and the muscle is relaxed from spasm, and it is corrected by that which already causes displacement
So that when you are going to lie down, take hold of the limb so that you do not grow careless in its care
And it is known that displacement is when it is at the back of the knee; so that you can distinguish between the displaced muscle and the normal muscle; for you will find among those differences the concavity of the muscle at the head and the prominence at the back of the knee, just as if there were a hole there, and the patient cannot withdraw his hand from the wound even if he wants to, nor can he bear any movement.
If it is displaced from the toes or heel, and you see it manifested by touch, do not hide it.
And from this displacement is made a gentle reduction when it is fresh and the patient is young
And the reduction is that the minister raises the limb to the back of the knee; and he places his thumbs behind the knee, and he raises the joint with force in their sockets, and the minister raises his hand, and extends the limb; and he pauses for a moment so that it returns naturally
More if in the beginning of the displacement, days have passed, the patient should be bathed in warm water and should be administered embrocation that softens and relaxes as if it were a salve of high quality, and rue, and chamomile in water, and should be administered
And so the patient should be supported on the thighs and be kept from moving until the swelling has gone down between the levitations and the stiffness, and the doctor should place his hand on the head of the muscle and pull the patient's hand so that it is not bruised at the back, and another minister should hold the patient's head, so that it is not bruised at the back, for that too must return to the socket
Or if you wish, you can reduce it in this way: and it is that you have another man present who is longer than the patient, and that he stands on that side, and you insert the knee of the limb behind the knee of the patient and elevate the thumb of the limb to the back of the knee until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the patient's hand from the back of the thigh. And if the patient is flexible, it is necessary that something else be suspended so that the displacement returns immediately.
And it is reduced easily in another way: and it is that a long staff is placed on the ground, the top of which is rounded like a mortar pestle, which is neither thick nor thin, and it is placed behind the patient; since when you place your hand over the top of the staff the patient's limb is stretched according to the length of the staff, and the other hand is stretched out from the other side with force, so that the joint returns to the socket quickly
And if it is difficult to reduce it for all the reasons we have said, the following treatment can be used: and you take a staff as long as two palms and as wide as four fingers, and its thickness is removed at the level of the tibia in this way:
And so you put around the rounded top some leather straps so that the staff does not bruise the patient
And so the thumb or the arm is placed over the staff until it reaches the back, and the staff is bound over the attendants and the arms and the limb.
And so the arm is placed on a scale of a ladder according to the width, and the hand is stretched out to the back, and the other limb is suspended from the other side so that the joint is inside
And when the limb is properly positioned according to any method that is convenient to you, and when you have placed a cushion of prepared powder of lead with egg album around all the muscles so that it is covered, and when you have stretched out the limb with force, and when the ligament is rotated over the cushion, and the hand is attached to the ankle, and is relaxed, and the hand is not bruised for seven days.
And so the patient should be given little food until the limb is comfortable, for it is more pleasant for the healing of the limb.
When food is eaten in greater quantity or movement is exercised; and thus if it is stopped and not irritated, then the pain has already vanished.
If the joint is dislocated, whether by moisture that has accumulated in it or for some other cause, then it is necessary to administer cautery three times, as it is said in the chapter on cautery.</end_of_turn>
If all this is done and seven days have passed, the ligament is detached and the joint is not fixed; the swelling and stiffness are reduced over them again, and it is not fixed and does not rise, knowing that the nerves of them, which are at the head of the muscle, are either insensible or extended or softened, and that the joint will never be kept in place forever.</end_of_turn>
As for the dislocation of that which is caused by the foot and the knee or the buttocks, reduction is useful with impulse and extension as far as it returns.</end_of_turn
And let the other stiffness be administered, and take care that it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If it happens that the healing is delayed in the limb and the movement is delayed, then the patient must use cold packs until that gravity is relieved and returns to its natural state.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXVVII.</end_of_turn>
Of the treatment of dislocation of the knee.</end_of_turn>
You know that the knee joint is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and that which is dislocated in all parts, and more so in the front part than in the back part, and the dislocation of the knee is not hidden from you when it is displaced either from the front or from the back, as it is evident that the knee is concave and cannot bend the knee, or touch with any part of the muscle.</end_of_turn
And that you must keep the knee bent, and reduce the dislocation as much as possible before the cautery comes, because if you see the cautery come, the reduction will be difficult, and will not be completely healed; and more so if it is in the back part, for it is more painful in all other kinds of dislocation, and there is more swelling in that.
And the restoration of the knee, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the hand of the patient is extended with two hands, and the knee is expanded, and the patient's hands are placed over the knee and leave it, and the physician should press the knee with the tips of his fingers or with the heel of his hand until it returns to its place.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation is in front, the pain returns as soon as you bend the knee, until you pierce the knee with the heel of your hand.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, the physician must administer violent extension and force.</end_of_turn
And two assistants extend the arms, and hold that support from the assistants so that it does not slip from the extension.</end_of_turn
And rotate the arms around all parts, because it is enveloped in cartilage bent along the hand, or ligament.</end_of_turn
And when the physician touches the knee with his hand, anoint that with some oil so that these causes which help to lubricate the knee are facilitated; and press the knee with force until it returns.</end_of_turn
And regarding the reduction, cover that it is paused over that bandage in which there is stiffness and exudate with a piece of cloth of wool, and that it is extended with a stricture descending, and the arm is suspended from the thigh, and is left for a few days.</end_of_turn
And so if the knee is formed in its place, then you must detach the ligament from it and leave it like that.</end_of_turn
And if the knee is not strengthened, then you must repeat the packing and the ligament, and leave it for a few days until it is extruded; and then detach that.</end_of_turn
And if it happens that gravity affects the reduction of the knee, and the situation of the limb is in movement, the physician must administer moisture in water and soft friction, and pressure, until it is relieved; or rest over the knee relieved of that fat; and tie it up, and leave it on the bone for the day and night.</end_of_turn And do that until that time, and put that in water; and when it swells, the physician must cool the knee with temperate friction, and repeat that three times, so that it is comfortable in movement, once, twice, and three times.</end_of_turn The corruption has already spread over the teeth within the bath, until it is bound.</end_of_turn>
If you wish, pause over the wet and scaly wound at the border and stretch over that; and make some vinegar, which is wet, and reduce it to its place.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XXVIII.</end_of_turn>
On the care of dislocation of the shoulder, which is between the arm and the hand.</end_of_turn>
The shoulder dislocation of the hand is displaced, and the reduction of the dislocation is easy, unlike other joints, however it must be done quickly in the moment when it is displaced, otherwise the limb will be permanently damaged or it will happen to it after the displacement that a burn occurs.</end_of_turn
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you pause the joint of the hand of the patient on a table and extend the hand of that, and put your hand or palm on the imminent joint, and hold that until it returns to its place.</end_of_turn
However, it must be considered if the palm is already lying against the inside of the hand, when the patient should put two hands over a table during extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is previous, you should put two hands, so that the hand of the doctor rests on that imminent joint.</end_of_turn
And therefore if it returns completely, that is good; and if not, when you have stretched that as much as possible giving way to the swelling, leave it like that; and do not repeat this until the swelling has gone down.
However, the joint remains according to its stiffness; and do not note to the patient any cause, but that the hand is softened and cannot stretch any cause; for it is known that the nerves are torn or crushed, and that it is not due to the injury itself but is stretched by the cautery in the treatment of it and is strengthened as much as the cause confesses.</end_of_turn
Therefore when the shoulder is returned, pause over it with the bandage which you have recommended, and leave it and stretch it for five days; and then remove the bandage and leave it and exercise the hand.</end_of_turn
However, if the movement is painful and occurs in any degree of gravity, leave that hand immersed in cold water and apply some vinegar, until the pain is relieved.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XXIX.</end_of_turn
On the care of dislocation of the fingers.</end_of_turn
Some of the fingers are dislocated throughout.</end_of_turn
And when any of those fingers is dislocated at the base of the palm or at the belly, then hold the finger and drive out the dislocation with the thumb, until it returns.</end_of_turn
And support the head of the finger, and suspend that beyond the part which is dislocated, and leave it for two days.</end_of_turn
And then suspend it and extend it until it is equal in that place on the next day.</end_of_turn
And when it is night, leave that bound according to that narration, and do not cease to loosen it in the day and exercise, and leave it at night; and do this for several days until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And do the same with regard to the pain that is at the belly of the hand, and leave that part to that side and do the first operation for the thumb, until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Similarly do the same with regard to the other parts.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXX.</end_of_turn
On the care of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.</end_of_turn
When an accident occurs to some of the vertebrae of the back or the head dislocation complete, and some vertebrae remain loose from their places, in that case there is no cure, for death covers the patient.</end_of_turn
And a sign of that is that the evacuation of the patient is outside of his will, and he cannot hold it back; and some veins are softened in some parts of his body or two veins of his limbs or two bones of his limb, or one of those; or a vertebra is loosened from its place, for some veins are loosened and some veins are made useless for the evacuation of those to four parts.</end_of_turn
Therefore that which is already loosened at the back is called gelliosis.</end_of_turn
May the care of them be that you consider whether the swelling occurred from puberty, for in that case it is neither a cure nor a healing of everything.</end_of_turn>
May it be that in that which you see by chance or by percussion or by suspicion as with the ancients, I have already said their methods of treatment are lengthy, of which the most is returned for profit; but I have already abridged that which is little esteemed for its excess, for my intimacy with the thing makes my explanation more comprehensive, to which I have alluded and formed with various instruments which I will show you and explain that one.</end_of_turn>
And of those there is no cure except that which occurs in the two things themselves as I will recommend.</end_of_turn>
And that the patient's illness be spread over his face over the jawbone towards the ear, and that you extend them so that their legs are not burdened.</end_of_turn
And then put one hand firmly on the thigh and keep it on the ground under the head, and another hand on their feet in the other thigh.</end_of_turn
The minister has the hand, and do not hold it in a ditch; and another minister has the other according to that form.</end_of_turn
And then fold over the patient's head and leave their limbs limp; and extend the limb of the limb towards the hand which is on the head of them, and tie that in it; and then strengthen the other limb over the ankles of them towards their buttocks, and tie those in the other hand.</end_of_turn
And then the ministers stretch the limb to the part of the hand, and do not leave the two hands and the limbs of their thighs in the places where they are, even though we have said that.</end_of_turn
And the doctor places his palms on the spine with strength until he returns, or that he places them on a table, and that he adjusts over the table the feet of the patient until he returns.</end_of_turn
And if he does not return in this way, take a table whose breadth or length is in the air of three hands, and dig a hole in the wall from which we have said that it is proper for the patient a place where the limb of the table is between.</end_of_turn And then place the palm of the table on the spine, and the doctor places the feet of the patient on the other side, and lift until the spine is contracted and returns to its place.</end_of_turn
And if you want, or turn it around with the hand; and that you stay on the ground that the head of the patient is behind the thigh of two hands, the length of which is one hand, and put the head of it behind the thigh and slightly above two hands; and that the length that is between each hand be a palm, and that is enough in every fist where the turn is made, and that no hand be fixed on the ground so that it is not crushed.</end_of_turn>
And that there be a round fist in which the turn is made, and that it is turned in the two humors of the two hands.</end_of_turn
And there is a fold in the limb in which the fist is formed, the length of which is a palm as it is turned; and in the other two fists it is similar to that.</end_of_turn
And then strengthen the ligaments that you have stretched in the feet of the patient in the fold where the head of them is placed, and the ligaments that you have stretched in the thighs of them in the turn where the feet of them are placed.</end_of_turn
And then you must do every turn and keep a minister who will hold the turn with his hand, and the doctor will grasp the spine as we have said.</end_of_turn
And when the spine is returned and the limb is engaged, the hour covers that he pauses with an egg-shaped bandage of alum, and then stops; and then he places over the bandage the edge of the table whose breadth is three fingers or more, and whose length is as much as covers the space of the swelling, and over the part of the spine.</end_of_turn
And do the same with the ligament which we have said, and use the patient for nourishment until he is healed.</end_of_turn>
If there is still any risk of inflammation in the area at the end of the treatment, it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe the inflammation over a prolonged period of time, which we have recommended; and this is usually done in the area around the ankle joint.
There are often accompanying injuries in the area of the heel bones of both feet, which is healed in this way; and that is the bone which has already been mentioned because it is necessary that it should not be injured further by this treatment, which will make you more likely to die.
Chapter 21.
Of the treatment of a dislocated ankle
It is known that the ankle joint and the ankle muscle joint do not suffer only from dislocation, but also from other affections that affect the other small joints of the foot, causing swelling and concavity
And the ankle joint is dislocated in four ways, that is, towards the front, towards the back, towards the side, or towards the heel
Mostly it is dislocated towards the front, and little towards the side or towards the heel
A sign of the dislocation of the ankle towards the front is that, when you adjust the limb of the patient with the sound limb, the swelling is greater and the area is more prominent than in the sound limb, and the limb cannot bend the toes without causing pain, and this is where the tip of the bone has been fractured.
The sign of the dislocation towards the side is that the injury is located on the opposite side of this one
The sign of dislocation towards the heel is that the limb is extended along the limb, but does not bend where it hurts, and if you force it to bend, the urine is retained and the swelling is prolonged, and you must walk on the heel
The sign of dislocation towards the heel is that the swelling does not expand, nor does the ankle bend where it hurts, and the limb is shorter than the sound limb, and the swelling is softened, and the tip of the bone is fractured at that place
In this case, the physician must consider that if the dislocation is old and chronic, it is already outdated, and that you have already administered reduction for it, and remain according to its disposition, because in this case it is not necessary to treat it; and indeed it is not recommended
However, in the case of recent dislocation, which is one of the four types of dislocation, you must take care that you reduce the joint and extend it towards the front and towards the back, and also towards the right and left, for the pain will return if you do not do so and will not desist until treated
However, if the pain does not disappear in this way, you must prepare to minister strong medicine and extend the limb further, or more tightly, or bind the limb with what is known as a liband; and another minister should stretch out the hand of the person who is being treated so that his toes touch the tips of his fingers; and strengthen the thumb over the area of the wound, and take another minister to hold the limb firmly in place.</start_of_turn>
And the extension of the limb or of the front part to the ankle bone, or from the back part to the heel bone.
And the extension of all of them until the patient's limb is elevated above the ground and remains hanging down.</start_of_turn>
This method of extension is common for all four types of dislocation
Therefore, if the dislocation disappears as we have said, it is good; otherwise, it is necessary for each type of dislocation to administer the appropriate treatment.</start_of_turn>
In the reduction of the dislocation itself, when it is dislocated, if the dislocation is towards the front, cover that the limb is rested on the outer side of the thigh; and place the liband over the area of the wound from the tip of the bone to the area just below the ankle bone; and stretch the liband from the area of the ankle to the area just above the heel bone.</start_of_turn
And another minister should firmly support the ankles, and make a tight bandage over the wound of the painful limb and extend it towards the front, so that the pain returns to its original place.</start_of_turn
This is a lighter treatment for this member than for the others.</start_of_turn
If he is excused on this account and does not obey the order, then it is necessary that his two feet be firmly bound together with strong thread, curiosity, over both ankles and both toes.
And let the length of each limb be as much as four fingers, and let the affected limb be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
And let the patient be suspended by the hip, and let him be in the middle; and let the length from the earth be as much as two cubits
And command a a strong youth that he reduce the cushion, and let another youth be suspended with the patient, and the other youth will reduce the cushion with force, so that the joint returns to its place quickly
But in the reduction itself, when it is dislocation outwards, cover that the patient grasps his heel as we have recommended in the former instance; and tighten the ligament over the affected limb properly and over the toes.
And two thighs are to be placed, one at the foot of the limb, and the other at the head; and two thighs are to be placed adjusted in the middle of the limb that has been placed over which a damp cloth is to be placed, so that the patient is not wet because the thigh is between the patient's thighs, because of this the extension of the limb must not be too violent
And every minister extends his part, and the doctor with his hand grasps the reduction according to the art
And when the dislocation is to the front, cover that the limb is extended with curiosity, as it is said in this medical treatise; and the doctor places his right hand over the affected limb, and with his left hand grasps that which is on the other side, and on that grasp he places that extended to the toes at the level of the ankle.
And if the dislocation is to the back, cover that the patient is not extended to the toes, but is elevated from the earth; having covered that it must be supported firmly, as if the ankle joint were dislocated outwards, as we have said of the support of the limb concerning two cubits; and it is on its face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, without haste.
And cover that a bandage is administered around the area of the joint at which the pain is located.<end_turn>
Therefore when the reduction is accomplished as we have said — and the sign of the reduction of the limb is not hidden from you, that you extend two limbs of the patient, and when once you have grasped those and the patient stretches his limb slightly and expands that relaxation, you know that the limb is returned as it should be — and then you adjust two cushions and place them under the limb and stretch out the bandage as much as the limb does not suffer from any bruising in any part; and adhere the patient to rest for three days or for four days.
And take out the ligament and the bandage, and compare one limb with the other.<end_turn>
And if you see that those grasps have been made in vain, you know that the dislocation is already stopped, and then you leave the patient to go about his business.<end_turn>
And if you see any sign of stiffness, you return and plaster that, and stretch that as you first structured it, and leave that for three days.
And take out that one also, and make that one walk slowly for a few days, until he is comforted
Chapter XXXII
Of the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle is dislocated in three ways, that is, it is dislocated outwards, and to the front, and to the back more than to the front; and to the front it is not dislocated.
And the sign of the dislocation of the limb is that the patient commands the patient to place his limb on the cushion; you know that the ankle is dislocated
And the restoration of all these ways is that you make the patient stretch his right foot, even though he has already stretched his limb; adhere the heel of the limb to its face, and place the foot of the limb between the thighs; and another minister extends the foot of the limb until the ankle returns to its place.
The sign of recovery is that the patient's limb adheres to the cushion that is floating weightlessly.
Then place the limb firmly against the cushion and bind it to the cushion with a bandage for three days or four, and then remove the bandage.</end_of_turn>
Do not allow the patient to walk for a few days until they are healed and comfortable.</end_of_turn>
If the reduction of the limb is excused, then administer strong stretching to the ligaments that were previously cared for in the groin.</end_of_turn
(The text continues with additional medical instructions.)</end_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.</end_of_turn>
The ankle has some veins that are easily ligated for slight displacement, and some veins are displaced according to custom, and the dislocation is caused either by the tendons or by the bones themselves.</end_of_turn
The sign of dislocation is that sometimes the ankle becomes flattened over the part where it is displaced.</end_of_turn
The treatment for displacement is gentle reduction, and it is done with ease by stretching the limb and supporting the limb until it returns to its normal position.</end_of_turn
In the treatment of dislocation according to custom, command the patient to rest, and have a strong and valiant minister at the back of the two fingers of the limb in the middle of the joint.</end_of_turn
And place your right hand over the front of the foot and your left hand over the back of the foot in the area of the ankle joint.</end_of_turn
Then pull the foot towards your right hand, and with your left hand pull it two veins, and then stretch with your left hand; and bind the ankle to the right side of the limb above the bandage.</end_of_turn
And do two veins as we have counted.</end>
And bind the foot to the bandage for the third vein, and you are at the ankle joint.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if it returns in one vein or two according to this manner, and if sometimes the foot is equal, it is good; otherwise, repeat the operation until it returns.</end_of_turn
If it is forbidden to reduce the limb as we have recommended, then make the patient sit on the bed, and put a pillow on the ground, and place a cushion between the patient's thighs, and you have already supported the limb above the wound to prevent further damage.</end_of_turn
And have the patient's attendants hold the patient's thighs, and another attendant stretch the foot with their hands or with ligaments that lie on the heel of the foot; and extend whichever minister you like against the extension of the thigh, and the pillow should remain between the patient's thighs to prevent the limb from being pulled towards the lower parts due to its extension.</end_of_turn
And the physician should gently reduce the dislocation with the thighs together, and another attendant should hold the healthy ankle towards the lower parts, so that the dislocation returns easily.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when the dislocation has returned and you have declared that the reduction is complete, then remove the support and gently stretch those ligaments firmly, and bind the foot to the bandage.</end_of_turn
And beware or be careful of the nerves that are behind the ankle, so that the ligament over that is not torn and that the limb is not stretched too much.</end_of_turn
And keep the limb still for two days or three; and if the ligament is softened, remove it.</end_of_turn
Then remove it on the third day or on the fourth, and prohibit the patient from walking for forty days.</end_of_turn If it is forced to go through that space, it is not wrong to ensure that the dislocation is not dissolved and corrupted, and that it does not receive treatment.</end_of_turn>
If the limb should happen to be fractured later, then cover that you administered in the description of our narrative in another place of care and support, until it is ligated.</end_of_turn
(The text continues with additional medical instructions.)</end_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes.)</end_of_turn
If it is dislocated, it should be equalised with little extension of the limb; and this is not difficult, it is a sign of curiosity.)</end_of_turn
If the dislocation is at the ankle bones of both feet, it is necessary to support the patient's foot over the ground or on a table, and to remain in this position as though one were going.
Stay close to the feet, and rest the sole of the foot on what is below the joints, and then cauterize around the area until it returns, and watch that it has become engorged and does not reappear in the area immediately.
And put under the foot a board that covers the whole foot, on which are two cushions, and strengthen that which is stretched downwards and hold it fixed for three days; and then remove that and allow it to walk for several days, until it is healed and the pain is gone
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn>
Of the various dislocations that are caused by swelling or fracture or some other lesion.</end_of_turn>
When any cause of these occurs, and you perform care of the wound and restore it, the patient will suffer death if you do not take immediate action.</end_of_turn
And for this, do not presume that care alone will suffice, but he who is skilled in the art, of long experience, merciful and compassionate, prudent, not proud or presumptuous; and that he should employ in the beginning of medicines that do not cause excessive pain only, and that he should read the patient by the divine judgment, not according to his own judgment, but according to that which hopes for salvation from destruction, both for the alleviation of the disease and for the appearance of any hope. And do your utmost to reduce it in the beginning of the disease, giving no further pain than is necessary.</end_of_turn
And when the limb returns as it should, then administer the regimen that will cause gradual healing of the wound and that will dry out the swelling.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation is of the fractured bones separated from each other, then you perforate the ligament between them, and do as is said in the simple diseases of those concerning these places.</end_of_turn
And be watchful and prudent according to your experience in those things that are said to you by fear, following my prediction; for what is better for you than to have recourse to the Creator? May this be permanent to your glory, and may your salvation be great in the time to come.</end_of_turn> Thus ends the book of Albucasim perfectly blessed by God.</end_of_turn> Amen.</end_of_turn>
