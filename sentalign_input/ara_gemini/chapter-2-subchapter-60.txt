Chapter Sixty on Extracting the Stone
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and we have mentioned the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and the signs of all of that, and we have mentioned the stones in which the work is done by hand and incision, which are the stones generated in the bladder specifically, and those that stick in the urethra, and I will describe that with a clear explanation and brevity, so I say that the stones generated in the bladder most often affect boys, and among its signs is that the urine comes out of the bladder similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it, and he scratches his penis and plays with it, and often it hangs down then spreads, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them,
and it is easy for boys to recover from them until they reach fourteen years of age, and it is difficult in old men, and as for young men, it is intermediate between that, and the one whose stones are larger, his treatment is easier, and the small ones are the opposite of that,
So if we proceed to treatment, it is necessary first to inject the patient with an enema that removes all the dung that is in his intestines, because it may prevent the presence of the stone during examination, then the patient is taken by his feet, and he is shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place several times, then you sit him between your hands upright, and his hands under his thighs, so that the whole bladder is tilted downwards, then you examine him and palpate him from the outside, so if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately proceed with the incision on it, but if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to wipe the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger if he is a fully grown boy, then insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, so that when it falls under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then you press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place where you want to incise it, and you order a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and you order another servant to stretch the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand, stretch the skin under the testicles away from the place where the incision will be,
Then you take the lancet, which is this image:
And you incise between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, but to the side of the left buttock, and the incision should be on the stone itself, with your finger in the anus, and you press it outwards, obliquely, so that the incision is wide from the outside and narrow from the inside, just enough for the stone to come out, not bigger, for perhaps the finger that is in the anus presses the stone at the incision, so it comes out without difficulty.
And know that some stones have angles and edges, so their exit is difficult for that reason, and some are smooth, resembling acorns, and rounded, so their exit is easy.
So what has angles and edges, you increase the incision a little, and if it does not come out like this, then you should contrive against it, either by grasping it with a tight forceps, the tip of which is like a file, so that it grips the stone and it does not escape from it, or by inserting a fine instrument with a hooked tip under it.
If you cannot manage it, then widen the incision a little, and if some blood overcomes you, stop it with alum.
If there is more than one, then first push the large one to the mouth of the bladder, then incise on it, then push the small one after that, and likewise, you do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then it is ignorance to make a large incision on it, because it exposes the patient to one of two things: either he dies, or he has constant dribbling of urine, because the place does not heal at all, but try to push it until it comes out, or contrive to break it with hooks until you bring it out in pieces.
So when you finish your work, pack the wound with frankincense, aloe, and costus, and tighten it, and put over it rags soaked in oil and syrup or rose oil and cold water to soothe the hot swelling, then the patient lies on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day, and when it is loosened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with the palm ointment and the basilicon ointment until it heals.
If an excessive hot swelling and erosion or the like occurs in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and urine being prevented from it, and this is known by the exit of blood with the urine, then insert your finger in the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it leads to corruption and putrefaction of the bladder.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and address each type with its corresponding treatment until it heals.
It is necessary during all treatment times to tie the thighs and bring them together to stabilize the medicines that are placed on the area.
If the stone is small and it goes into the urethra and gets stuck in it, and urine is prevented from exiting, then treat it with what I am describing before it reaches the incision, for I have often dispensed with the incision with this treatment, and I have tried it, which is that you take a branched instrument of steel, this is its form:
Triangular-tipped, sharp, and embedded in a stick.
Then you take a thread and tie the penis with it below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then you gently insert the forked instrument into the urethra until the fork reaches the stone itself, and you turn the fork with your hand on the stone little by little while you intend to pierce it until you penetrate it from the other side, then the urine will flow immediately.
Then you squeeze your hand over what remains of the stone from outside the penis, for it will crumble and come out with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not feasible for you due to an obstacle preventing you from doing so, then tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then cut on the stone in the penis itself between the two ties, then remove it, then untie the tie and clean the clotted blood that has formed in the wound.
It is necessary to tie the thread below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other tie from above so that when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, it is advisable for you, if you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upwards so that it returns when you are finished and covers the wound as we have said.
