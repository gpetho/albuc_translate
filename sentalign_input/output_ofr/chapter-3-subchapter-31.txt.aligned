Know that at the joints of the hip and at the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations occur, and they do not occur as in other joints; and the hip joint is dislocated in four directions: inwards and outwards, and forwards and backwards; and more inwards than elsewhere, and rarely dislocates forwards and backwards.	You should know that a complete dislocation alone is sustained by the hip and shoulder joints; they do not sustain the lesser displacements, with concavity, as do the other joints. Now the hip joint is dislocated in four directions, interior, exterior, posterior, and anterior. Most commonly it is dislocated interiorly; and rarely is it dislocated anteriorly or posteriorly.	0.86800027
And the sign of its inward dislocation is that when the injured leg is compared with the healthy one, it is longer, and the patient's knee appears more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their knee towards the buttock; and the place nearby is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the femur goes there.	The indication of an internal dislocation is that when you compare the patient's sound leg with the injured leg it will be longer and the knee will be prominent as compared with that of the sound leg; nor will it be possible for the patient to flex the foot back on the groin; and there will be an obvious swelling near the groin because the head of the femur has moved there.	0.8826363
And the sign of the one that goes outwards, is that the symptoms are opposite to the previous ones.	The sign of the occurrence of an external dislocation: the symptoms will be the exact contrary to these.	0.61647105
And the signs of the one that goes forwards is that they extend their leg fully; however, they do not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make them walk, they cannot go forward, and they retain their urine, and the groin swells, and when they walk, they step on their heel.	The sign of an anterior dislocation is that the patient can stretch his leg out fully but cannot flex it without feeling pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk he will be unable to walk forward; and he has retention of the urine and his groin swells, and in walking he hobbles upon his heel.	0.8520026
And the signs of the one that goes backwards is that they cannot extend or bend their knee, and that leg is more crooked than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is located beneath the ribs.	The sign of a posterior dislocation is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he flex it before flexing the hip; also the leg will be shorter than the other, the groin will be relaxed, and the head of the femur will be evident at the lumbar region.	0.7892684
The reduction of this type of dislocation is as follows: you consider if the dislocation is old, and it remains fixed in its position, there is no cure; and one should not be presumptuous.	As to the reduction of the various forms of this dislocation, you must examine the case and if it be an old dislocation which the patient has suffered from for a long time and the reduction of which has not been contrived and which remains as it was, there is no treatment for it at all, nor should any be attempted.	0.68294096
And in the one whose dislocation is fresh, and it is of the four types of dislocation, hurry to turn the joint, and stretch it inwards and outwards, and move it right and left; perhaps it will return, and no other treatment will be necessary.	But in that case whose dislocation is recent, whichever of the four kinds of dislocation it be, hasten to rotate the joint and extend it internally and externally and move it to the right and the left; for often it will return and no further treatment will be needed.	0.8629794
And if it does not return in this manner, you must prepare a strong assistant, and strongly extend the leg with two hands, or with a strap tied above the knee; and another assistant extends their hand from above in such a way that they place their hands under the armpits, then gently tighten a strap on the thigh; and another holds the end of the strap; and they all pull upwards and downwards at the same time, until the patient is lifted from the ground all at once, and hangs suspended.	But if it does not go back thus, you must have ready a sturdy and powerful assistant to extend the leg from below, either with both his hands or with a wrapper bound upon the leg above the knee; while another assistant pulls from above by putting his hands under the patient's axillae; then you should bind a soft wrapper upon the root of the thigh, with a third assistant to hold the end of the bandage. Then extension should be made either anteriorly from the direction of the groin to the direction of the clavicle, or posteriorly toward the dorsal spine. Let them all make their extension simultaneously so the patient is lifted up bodily and remains suspended.	0.9034256
This method of extension is common to the four types, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, that is good.	This kind of extension is common to all four kinds of dislocation. If the dislocation goes back by the way we have said, good.	0.86997116
If not, then a treatment specific to its type must be applied. When the dislocation is inwards, you should lay the patient on their healthy side, then place the strap on the top of the thigh, and the place that is below the groin, then stretch the strap upwards towards the groin, and towards the cleft; then another assistant takes their arms, and embraces the thick part of the affected thigh, and extends it outwards strongly: it will return to its place immediately; and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.	Otherwise, each kind must have the special treatment I shall describe. When it is an internal dislocation then the special reduction is for the patient to lie upon his sound side; then apply a wrapper to the root of the hip in the space between the head of the femur and the part below the groin; then carry the bandage upward from the groin toward the upper part of the body, in the direction of the clavicle. Then another powerful and sturdy assistant is to take hold of his arms while the thick part of the afflicted thigh is clasped and strongly extended outward; then it will return to its place. This kind of treatment is easier than the others for the reduction of this limb.	0.88980126
And if you cannot reduce it in this way that we have described, you must tie the patient's two feet together with a strong, soft strap above both heels, and above both knees, and the injured leg should be extended two fingers' breadth more than the other; then it should be hung from the end of a wooden beam, and be two arm-lengths above the ground; then instruct an assistant to embrace the top of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who firmly embraces the thigh, for the joint will return to its place quickly and immediately.	But if you find it refractory and it does not answer to this method of treatment, then the patient's two feet will have to be bound together with a strong soft bandage round his two ankles and his two knees. The distance from each to the next should be four fingers, and the injured leg should be stretched two fingers beyond the other. Then the patient is to reach upward and grasp any beam that may be in the house; he should be about two cubits from the floor. Then tell a powerful servant to clasp the head of the hip and another servant to hang from the patient; and the other servant, the one who is clasping the hip, should thrust powerfully; then the hip will speedily go back.	0.87584317
And when the dislocation is outwards, the patient lies as we have described for the one with a gibbosity, and tighten a strap securely on the affected leg, and on the foot also; then place two sticks, one at the head and the other at the feet, then insert a stick between the patient's thighs in the middle of the buttocks; and have damp cloths placed around, so that it does not injure the patient, then each assistant extends towards themselves, and the surgeon replaces the dislocation with their hand.	The special method of reduction in the case of an external dislocation: it will be necessary for the patient to be lying on a bench after the manner described for the one with a curvature of the spine; but wrappers are to be tied only on the injured leg and the chest. Then the two spars are to be set in position, one at his feet and another at his head; and have an additional spar firmly fixed in the middle of the bench and wrapped in soft cloth so as not to injure the patient; this spar is to be between his thighs so that he will not be dragged down during extension. Then each assistant is to pull in his own direction while the doctor sets the hip with his hands.	0.85554755
If it returns (to its place), that is good.	And if it goes back, good.	0.7002329
If not, place (him) on a table, and press as we have described for the gibbosity, and the patient lies on their healthy side.	But if not, place the board upon it and put pressure upon it just as we prescribed for curvature, except that the patient will have to lie upon his sound side.	0.74106634
And when the dislocation is forwards, it is necessary to extend the injured leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and the surgeon puts their effort on the injured groin, then presses with the other hand, and extends it downwards towards the knee.	When it is an anterior dislocation, extension will have to be applied forcefully to the patient's leg, on the bench, exactly as described; the doctor should place the palm of his right hand upon the injured groin and then apply pressure with the other hand, directing the pressure so as to make extension downward toward the knee.	0.82077014
