When the jaw is broken below, and there is no wound outside, and the fracture is only external, and it is not broken into two, only curved inside, it is easily recognized.	When the lower jaw is broken and it is a fracture without an open wound, examine it.	0.56058884
If the fracture is on the right side, you must place your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, place your index finger of the right hand, and gently align the fracture inside, and adjust it with the other hand from outside, and set it evenly.	If it is merely an external fracture, not broken in two but sunken inwards, which is easily recognized, you should introduce the index of your left hand into the patient's mouth if it be a right-hand fracture; but your right index if it be a left-sided fracture; and with this, from within, push the concavity of the fracture gently outwards, with the other hand outside, regulating the correction.	0.8340032
And if the fracture of the jaw is separated into two, you must apply traction from both sides, until it is even.	If the break in the jaw be total, into two, traction must be employed, in a straight line on both sides, until it can be set.	0.8137047
And if the teeth are dislodged, or broken, bind them with a thread of gold or silver or silk, then place wax on the broken jaw, and apply a double cloth; and place on the cloth a large, well-made splint, or a piece of leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it as best you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.	If any of the teeth be loosened or broken away, bind those that you hope may be preserved with a gold or silver or silken ligature; then put wax upon the fractured mandible, and upon that a doubled dressing, and upon the dressing a large and strong splint or a piece of shoe-sole leather, the length of the jaw; then over that bandage in such wise as you conveniently can and as will conduce to drawing it together so as not to loosen. Bid the patient hold himself quiet and still, and let his food be soft broths.	0.888538
And if you see the alignment change, untie it on the third day, and then reset what has changed; and apply a poultice, made of mill dust with plenty of eggs or sesame flour, after you have removed the wax; and place light wool on the poultice, and if the poultice adheres, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until it is healed; often it is healed in three weeks.	If you think there is any change of form at all, hasten to loosen it on the third day; then correct the change and apply a plaster of mill-dust and egg-white, or of white flour, after you have removed the wax from it, applying soft tow over the plaster. So long as the plaster sticks on it and the bone undergoes no change of state, let it be and do not loosen until it heals and the fracture mends, for often a fracture of this kind mends in three weeks.	0.89053154
And if a hot abscess occurs, administer what we have said many times.	If during that time an effusion occurs, employ those means of allaying this that we have often mentioned, until the swelling subsides.	0.48459423
And if there is a fracture and a wound together, check if any piece of bone is missing; if so, carefully remove it with suitable instruments.	If the fracture be with an open wound, examine it, and if one or more splinters have been detached from the bone, gently remove the pieces of splinter with any suitable instrument.	0.72487885
And if the wound is narrow, enlarge it with a flame according to your need.	If the opening of the wound be narrow, open it up with a scalpel as much as you need.	0.639184
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound if it is large, and apply a suitable poultice to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.	When you have removed these pieces, letting no trace of them remain, suture the opening of the wound if it is wide; otherwise apply one of the ointments that are suitable for that purpose and will encourage the growth of flesh over the wound, until it heals.	0.776363
