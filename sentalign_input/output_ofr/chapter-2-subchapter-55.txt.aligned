Sometimes children are born without an opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in the right place.	On the treatment of boys born with imperforate urinary meatus; or with the meatus small or not in the proper place. Sometimes a boy is born from his mother's womb with the glans penis not perforate.	0.72198844
So it is necessary to pierce it immediately with a very fine spatula according to this form/method:	So at the moment of his birth you should be quick and make a perforation with a fine scalpel figured thus.	0.6008791
Then put in the opening a fine nail of lead, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days and when he needs to urinate, the nail should be removed, and let him urinate, and then replace it;	Then put in the opening a slender leaden sound, tie it and keep it in for three or four days. When he wishes to make water, it will be removed and he will do so; then put it back.	0.8030261
He whose opening is small, is treated with the lead nail, as we have said, so it will widen.	The case having too narrow a meatus should be treated with the leaden sound, as we have said, for many days until it is wide enough.	0.5326227
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born with the opening at the tip of the penis, so they cannot urinate forward unless they raise their penis up; and cannot procreate because the semen cannot reach the vagina, and this is a bad condition.	In those cases having a misplaced meatusâ€”for example, there are some born with the opening at the edge of the glans so that they cannot make water forwards until the opening of the penis is lifted up by hand, nor can they beget, since the semen cannot reach directly to the uterus, a disorder which is very ugly.	0.7400069
And the method of the procedure is that the patient lies on his back, then you extend the tip of the penis and cut it like the width of a quill, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;	The manner of operating in this case is for the patient to lie back; then with your left hand draw out his glans firmly and cut the end of the glans at the place of the meatus with a broad knife or sharp scalpel, as if sharpening a pen, or as if you were whittling something, so that the middle of it protrudes like a glans penis and the opening falls in the middle as it should.	0.6666794
and beware of bleeding which often occurs there, and if it happens, staunch it with something that stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.	And beware, in your operating, of haemorrhage, which often happens; meet it with styptics and dress the wound until it heals.	0.7293519
