of the fracture of the mandible/jawbone
When the mandible is broken underneath, and there is no external wound, and the break is internal only, and it is not broken in two, except perhaps fractured internally, then one can recognize it easily. 
It is necessary, if the break is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the break is in the left mandible, then put your right index finger in, and gently push the fracture inwards, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the fracture of the mandible is separated into two, then you must administer extension from both sides, until it is even.
And if loosening or breaking of the teeth occurs, secure them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then put cerate on the broken mandible, and put on a double cloth; and put on the cloth a well-made large star, or a piece of leather, evenly shaped, long and wide according to the mandible, and tie it on as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, untie it on the third day, and then readjust what has changed; and apply a plaster, made of mill dust with egg white or sesame flour, after you have removed the cerate; and put light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster dries and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until he is healed; many times he is healed in three weeks. 
And if hot abscesses develop, then administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, see if any piece of the bone has been removed; then carefully remove it with suitable instruments.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a lancet according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound, if it is large, and apply a suitable plaster to generate flesh, until it is healed.
