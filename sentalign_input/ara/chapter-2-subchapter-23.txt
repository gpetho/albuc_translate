Chapter Twenty-Three
On Hypopyon.
We have mentioned the types of fluids in the classification and which ones are suitable for cupping with detailed and explanatory words. Take them from there correctly. Then you should sit the patient before you, cross-legged, facing the light, near the sun.
And you bandage his healthy eye and tighten it well, then lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye containing the fluid is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the lancet near the iris, about the thickness of a probe, in the white of the eye itself, towards the smaller canthus, then push the lancet forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the lancet that it has reached an empty space.
And the depth of the lancet's penetration should be equal to the distance between the pupil and the edge of the black, which is the iris of the eye, because you will see the lancet in the eye of the observer due to the clarity of the cornea. Then turn the lancet upwards to the place where the fluid is.
Then press it downwards repeatedly. If the fluid descends immediately, the patient will see whatever he opens his eyes to immediately, while the lancet is still in his eye. Then wait a little. If the fluid rises, lower it again without removing the lancet.
When it has settled and does not rise, remove the lancet gently while slowly rotating it with your hand. Then dissolve some pure Indian salt in water and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then place a compress or moistened wool over the entire outside of the eye.
With rose oil and egg white, and bandage the healthy eye as well. But we and the people of our time apply crushed cumin with egg white on it. If the lancet does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes.
Then you should take the scalpel called "al-bared," which looks like this:.
Pierce the conjunctiva only with it, and do not penetrate deeply.  The purpose is just to prepare a small place for the lancet. Then insert the lancet as we have described. When your work is complete, prepare a comfortable bed for the patient to lie on his back in a darkened room.
He should refrain from all movement and coughing. His food should be what softens his nature. He should not move his head right or left at all. The bandage should remain in place until the third day, then you loosen it in that darkened room and test his vision.
Show him some things, then replace the bandage until the seventh day. You should not do this during the treatment or immediately after the incision. Rather, you should avoid this beforehand, because water rises quickly with intense looking.
If a hot swelling appears, you should uncover the eye before the seventh day and treat it with what will reduce the swelling. When it subsides, you can then release his sight and put a veil over his face, training his vision under it for a few days while he is in the darkened room. Then...
He may gradually leave the house and manage his affairs.  Know that the learner cannot dispense with observing the incision many times before proceeding with the operation. I have heard from some Iraqis that they mentioned making a hollow lancet in Iraq that sucks out the water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make it, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients. It may be a recent innovation. This is a picture of the types of lancets, so those who are unfamiliar with them may understand them:.
They are made specifically of brass, and their tips are of this thinness exactly, triangular and sharp.
