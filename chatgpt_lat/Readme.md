# Prompting ChatGPT

ChatGPT with the GPT-4o model was run between Nov 1 and Nov 4, 2024 using the free tier in the web chat interface.

The initial prompt was the following:

```
The following sentences are from a medieval Latin translation of the 10th century Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis. Translate each line one by one, printing the translation of each Latin line on a separate line. Do not add any notes, comments or explanations, just print the Latin line followed by its translation on a new line like this:

These are the lines to translate:
