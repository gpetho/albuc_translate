Of the abscess of the testicles
Know that in the treatment of this branch (of medicine), there is fear in many situations, therefore it seems to me it is better to leave it alone;
and I will tell you the procedure and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses occur in the body, and particularly in the testicles;
and this is for many reasons.
That is to say by an excess of sour and sharp (humor), which spreads to the testicles, or from a blow;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body;
and there is no pain, and it is a serious abscess;
and sometimes there is a severe, pale, and stony abscess, and of a weak color, and sometimes it comes from damage to an artery, or from swelling of a vein.
When it is from damage to an artery, it is known by the disposition of a warm abscess, when you press it with your fingers;
and you should not touch it.
The one that is made from the swelling of a vein is known by its disposition to the pressure of the touch of the fingers, and one can well make the incision on this appearance, and on the other flesh;
and you must cut the heart of the testicles, then stretch the egg upwards, and pull it away from the white membrane, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the egg.
If the testicle is already adhered to this new flesh, then you must pull the testicle, and cut it;
and if there is air in the tunica vaginalis, or in that which is inside the vessels, then you must free all this membrane, and cut it roundly.
And if the growth of the flesh is in the back part, then you must cut it all, and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is completed, then fill the wound with wool moistened in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
