Â¶ On the restoration of fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Chapter X.
Fracture sometimes happens to the bones of the neck, and rarely do they suffer attrition: the same is true of the vertebrae of the back.
When this happens to someone and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider this.
For if you see that his hands are softened, numb, and lifeless, and he cannot move them, nor extend, nor grip them; and when you press them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, he feels nothing, nor any pain: then you know it will not heal, and in most cases, it is fatal.
But if he moves them and feels compression and pricking in them when touched with fingers, then you know that the spinal marrow is intact, and the patient will heal with treatment.
And if something similar occurs with the vertebrae of the back and you wish to know whether he will heal or not, then look at his feet: if you see that they are softened and what happened in the hands also occurs in them; then, when he lies on his back, he passes gas and waste involuntarily, and when he lies on his stomach, waste exits without control; and when he lies on his back and wishes to urinate but cannot, you know it is fatal.
Do not therefore put effort into his treatment.
But if none of that happens to him, the case is lighter.
And the treatment for what happens in such cases is to attempt to reduce any hot swelling: place rose oil on the affected vertebra alone, or with the yolk of roasted eggs.
Apply this several times a day, until the hot swelling subsides: then place on the spot one of the strengthening, drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage: and instruct the patient to rest in peace and quiet.
He should not sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed.
If a bone fragment has loosened at the site of attrition, or anything else becomes detached, you must cut above the skin and remove it.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures.
Then treat it with a healing ointment until it heals.
If the last bone of the spine is fractured, at the end of the tail: you must insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus and align the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible, in a second adjustment.
Then place over it, and remove it: and treat the wound as previously described, until it heals.
