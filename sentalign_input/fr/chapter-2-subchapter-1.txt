About the head full of water
Know that this illness often comes to children at birth, when the delivery process compresses the child's head too strongly; and sometimes it comes from an unknown cause.
And I have never seen this illness except in children, and in all those I have seen, death hastened; and therefore it seems to me that it is better to leave the work of such treatments.
And I saw one child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled every day until it could no longer be supported; and the moisture grew so much that the child died, and this moisture is gathered beneath the bone above the brain, between the brain and the bone; and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, you make a wide incision in the middle of the head; and it should be as long as two nuts, so that the moisture flows; and here is the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is greater, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions in the form of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs are that you see the sutures of the head opened on each side, and the water jumps out when you press it with your hand inside, and this is not answered: you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, draw out all the moisture. Then press the incisions with cloths and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it until the fifth day; then uncover it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head be pressed evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limbs are strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is to look where the size of the abscess and the gathering of the water appears; for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Then cut where the abscess appears, and the filling of the water, and make the incision as you have the ability; and be careful not to cut the artery; and let the blood flow, so that the patient does not die from the outflow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
