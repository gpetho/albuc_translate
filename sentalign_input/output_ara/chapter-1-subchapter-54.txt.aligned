If someone experiences tremors from a chill in a nerve or from quartan fever or other causes, it is necessary to cauterize him four or five times on the spinal vertebrae, one cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on his chest. And one cauterization on his stomach with the olive-shaped cautery. The tremors will cease, and this speeds up the resolution of the cold ailment.	When someone has a tremor, either from chill in a nerve or quartan fever, or from some other cause, you should cauterize him four or five times over the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra, and one on his breast and one on his stomach, with an olivary cautery. Thus the tremor will be stilled and the dispersal of the cold distemper will be hastened.	0.9545239
