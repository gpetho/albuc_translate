Many children are born without a perforated anus, but rather it is closed by a thin membrane: so the midwife must pierce this membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and take care that the umbilical cord is not touched; then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, then treat with ointment until it is healed.	Infants are quite often born with the anus imperforate, closed by a fine membrane; then the midwife should perforate the membrane with her finger or pierce it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle. Then wool dipped in oil and wine should be applied, and treat it with ointments until healed.	0.838157
And if you fear that it will close again, place a lead tube in the opening, and leave it for several days, and remove it when the child needs to go to the toilet/latrine.	If you are afraid it may close up, put into the opening a leaden tube for many days, which will be removed when the child wants to evacuate the bowel.	0.7420561
And sometimes this blockage comes from the healing of a wound or abscess; so it is necessary to cut this adhesion: and it should be treated, as we have said, with the lead tube.	Sometimes also the anus is closed by the scarring of a wound or an abscess; then the scarring should be incised, and then dressed by those methods we have mentioned, including the leaden tube.	0.7494369
