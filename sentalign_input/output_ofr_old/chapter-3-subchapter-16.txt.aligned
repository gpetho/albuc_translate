of the fracture of the leg	On setting a fracture of the leg.	0.55180144
Know that in the leg there are two bones, one of which is rightly called "tibia", and the other is called "fibula"; and fractures occur just as they do in the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is all there.  And if both bones are broken together, the leg turns in all directions.	One of them is thick and is called 'leg bone' (tibia). The other is slender and is called 'fire-stick' (fibula). Both of these are liable to the same kinds of fracture as occur in the two bones of the forearm, therefore the repair of them will be like that of the arm, and the operation is one and the same. If both bones are broken together, the leg will turn in all directions.	0.83430505
And if the slender bone is broken, it turns forward.	If the fibula is broken there will be a forward deformity of the leg.	0.60943305
And if the large bone is broken, great pain is felt, and it is easily seen; and it turns underneath/inward.	If the tibia be broken, and that low down, it will be obvious to you. Employ levelling and extension and binding on of splints similar to that (sc.	0.5238798
Then apply traction, and set it evenly, and tie the splints evenly; but nevertheless, if the fracture is severe, and there are multiple pieces, the traction must be less and lighter; and adjust according to your skill.	But it will be necessary, if the fracture of the leg be a serious one with much fragmentation, for the extension to be gentler and lighter; and you must employ the utmost gentleness in setting it.	0.67213845
