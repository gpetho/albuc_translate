Exinach is a fat that forms in the tissues of the upper eyelids, and this happens more in children than in adults, and it greatly troubles their eyes, and they get catarrh in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because the tears rush to their eyes; and because of this they lie on their faces often, and sleep on their faces, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist and the swelling and appearance are covered with exinach that appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the exinach in between.	Hydatid is fat which arises in the folds of the upper lid. It is a disease chiefly occurring in children, irritating their eyes, giving them morning catarrh; they are unable to look full into the light of the sun, since they get an immediate secretion of tears. And for that reason you will find them lying always on their faces, and they also sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below the eyebrows are moist and covered with swellings, while the hydatid stands out prominently; and when you press upon the place with your finger you can feel the fat beneath it.	0.85842705
Then extract it with a piece of cloth placed between your fingers on the outside, and turn your hand to the right and left until it is expelled; and be careful not to press in the cut, so that you do not come with the spatula to the eye, and injure it.	Draw it out with a cloth rolled between your fingers, turning your hand to right and to left till it is separated. Be careful not to go so deep with your scalpel that it sticks in the eye and injures it.	0.8383277
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the cut, then increase the cut slightly until it appears; then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind with bandages.	If you do not see the hydatid at the first incision, you must gently cut a little deeper till it comes forth, then draw it out as described. Then dip some cloth in vinegar and water, apply to the place and bind it up with pads.	0.75796443
And there are such men who grind salt and place it on to corrupt that moisture that remains. Then treat it until it is healed. And if a hot abscess comes to the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.	There are some who grind up salt and put it in the hollow of the incision to liquefy thereby the remains of the humidity. Then dress till healed. If an effusion occur in the place, treat with sedative plasters till healed.	0.8280432
