It is necessary when you treat the tooth for its pain that you delay pulling it as long as you can, because it should not be done; because it is a very serious matter until there is no excuse for scraping. So when the patient is forced to pull the tooth, you must be sure of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they believe it is in the healthy tooth, and have the good tooth pulled; and yet the pain does not go away until the bad one is extracted, as we have already seen with these lords; and when you are sure of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a strong spatula to protect the gums on all sides; then move it with your fingers or with delicate forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly fix the forceps; and let the patient’s head be in your lap between your knees, and hold him well so that he does not move.	You should treat toothache with every device and be reluctant to extract; nothing can replace the tooth when it is extracted, for it is a noble substance—until there is no means of avoiding extraction. When the patient is determined to have it out, act with deliberation till you are sure which is the painful tooth; for often the pain deceives the patient and he thinks the pain is in a tooth that is sound, so he has that one extracted; but the pain does not abate until the diseased tooth is removed. We have frequently seen this happen in the practice of the barber-surgeons. When you are quite sure which is actually the painful tooth you should cut away all round the tooth with a scalpel having a certain measure of strength, until the gum is separated all round.	0.8276962
Then extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out, take one of these instruments and insert it on each side lightly, and move it as you did at first. And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with cloth where the holes are; and then extract it delicately with forceps, so that it does not break during extraction; and you must work very carefully around the gums to loosen the tooth.	Then draw the tooth straight out so as not to splinter it. And if it will not come out, then take one of these following instruments and gradually introduce it beneath the tooth all round; then try to move it as you did before. If the tooth has a hole in it or is decayed, you should plug the hole with a rag, forcing it in with the tip of a fine probe so that it will not break when you grip it with the forceps. You must completely scarify all round the gum.	0.9161761
The forms of the instruments used to loosen the teeth first should have long points and thick handles, so they do not bend when you pull the tooth; and these are the forms:	The shape of the fine forceps with which you first move the tooth should be with long jaws and a short handle, thick, lest they bend when you take hold of the tooth. And this is the shape of the large forceps.	0.79674876
And they should be thick so they do not bend when pulling, and made of well-crafted iron, and should have teeth to hold the tooth firmly.	They should be of Indian iron or of steel, strongly made, the jaws tempered and having teeth fitting into each other so that a sure and firm grip may be obtained. Sometimes the jaws are made like a file, also to give a strong grip.	0.69768465
