On the Method of Cauterizing Althelul (Lesions or Ulcers) after Their Removal
Chapter 37.
When you remove althelul (lesions or ulcers), heat a cautery shaped like a rod.
Then insert the heated cautery into the cut althelul, pressing until it reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.
If there are multiple althelul, cauterize each one as described.
Then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal.
If you cauterize with a large cautery over the alcatin, this is the most beneficial method.
