of the hairs of the eyelids
When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural ones, and become irritating, they harm the eyes and cause various ailments such as habitual tears and softening of the eyelids and albugo, to the point of causing the destruction of the eyes;
and the treatment is according to four methods:
either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is described above in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and stitching or by small tubes/pipes, as I will explain.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn back the eyelid with your left hand;
if it is inverted/turned outwards, it is good;
if not, then insert a needle with a thread through it;
and let this be near the edge of the eyelid where the eyelashes grow, near these hairs, and pull the thread up along with the eyelid, and turn it towards the surgeon/barber;
then cut in the part below the eyelid, beneath the eyelashes, with the spatula-shaped knife, from the large tear duct to the small one;
then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small tent of cotton and cloth, then draw on the eyelid a figure with ink, like a myrtle leaf, and however, it must be that the figure is according to the amount that you want to raise the eyelid which is separated from the others.
And there are some who need a large amount of the eyelid cut, depending on how softened the eyelid is;
then cut with the spatula-shaped knife along the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct to the small one;
and let one of the cuts be near the natural eyelashes about the thickness of a hair, then place the hook in one of the two angles of the heart shape, then peel it all off;
then join the two edges with a suture using a needle and a thin woolen thread, and wipe the blood, and burn the excess threads above the eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so;
and if not, don't worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without stitching, with drying and constricting substances, for the eyelid lifts itself up when the wound closes and joins together, but stitching is better (as the ancients said), and this is a painless procedure;
and there is another method:
and that is you mark the eyelid with a figure shaped like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three points separated according to the shape shown here:
then cut what is protruding with small, even cuts according to the shape shown here:
And if you are unable to hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with a thread in it, and place it in the middle of the figure;
and place another thread next to the large tear duct, and the second thread next to the small one, and gather the threads evenly between your fingers;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have made the mark, as we have described, then bring together the two edges of the wound by stitching, and treat it until it is healed; 
and if an abscess develops at your incision, soothe it with a plaster and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelid are turned inwards:
so you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitching in one and the other is more specialized.
The treatment of dog bites is as follows:
and it is that you turn the eyelid and slit it inside as I have said, and then make two incisions skillfully, and two fine threads as long as the eyelid and the width of the spatula;
and cut at the two ends on the two sides where you hold the threads;
then join one and the other delicately over what protrudes from the eyelid, and tighten the two incisions of the two parts firmly;
and leave it thus for some days, and the skin that was constricted will die and blacken and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with scissors, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is closed, the eyelid will be lifted, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the shape of the two incisions that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
