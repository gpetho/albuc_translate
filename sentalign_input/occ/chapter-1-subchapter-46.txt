Chapter Forty-Six:
On the cauterization for twists.
When pain occurs in some members due to a fall or an impact, and that pain persists for a long time and does not respond to medication, it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery should be done according to the size and strength of the member, and the location of the twist and pain.
Therefore, if it heals with the first cautery, it is good; if not, then repeat the cautery. For the custom of these pains is that they are punctured from one member to the next, and it is necessary to continue with cauterization until the patient is healed.
