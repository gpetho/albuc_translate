He, who completed this book for you, O my son, this work on the science of medicine, which has been completed and reached its ultimate goal in clarity and explanation; I have seen that he finished it for you with this treatise, part of the handiwork.
For his handiwork has been improved in our land and at our time when he studied the science of medicine and its impacts. Yet it remained a walking lesson in the early books, where his hand had scattered errors and confusion until its meanings were obscured and benefits lost.
I have seen that he revived and restored it in this treatise on explanation, presentation, and summary; bringing forth images of surgical instruments and other tools of work from the increase in elucidation and prevention of what is needed by him.
The reason there is no better craftsman in our time for this is because the field of medicine is extensive, and it behoovangs his lord to have been educated beforehand by Gallenus who described surgery. To stand upon the benefits of body parts and their tools, treatments and emotions, connections and separations, knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, numbering them, exits, heart valves, veins, and locations of openings.
Therefore, he said that the physicians are called by many names and indeed few in number, especially in the field of hand surgery, and we have mentioned this on one side from this book.
Because he was not an expert, as we mentioned from the dissection that it falls into a mistake that kills people with it, which can be seen very often in this science and is called without knowledge and no experience.
Thus, I saw a foolish physician cut into the lymph nodes of a woman'amoq (probably an error in transcription or text) and he closed off some of the throat vessels causing her to bleed until she fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another physician advancing with a lymph node excision for a man who had an issue in his mouth, and the swelling was large causing him to expel it through a piece of gland of the prostate. The man died within three days, and I had summoned him for discharge when I found bone from the prostate gland and assessed his condition as such.
And I saw another physician approaching a group of our men from the medical side.
An incident occurred where Black was found with a fracture in his leg near the knee, and the fastest physician concealed it by binding the break on the wound using bandages and strong cords without allowing the wound to breathe.
Then he indulged in his desires and left him for days, commanding him not to remove the bandage until his leg and foot became infected, leading to his demise.
He commanded the fastest to untie the bandage for relief and escape from his pain, but since decay had taken hold of the limb, I could not heal it.
The decay did not cease within the limb until his death.
I saw another physician swell and develop cancer after a few days, and it is not appropriate for the dark mixture from Susu to be exposed with molten iron.
Except that it may infiltrate the entire limb.
Therefore, my children, you should know that the work by hand is divided into two categories: one brings safety and the other often accompanies defects in many cases.
He has informed you in every place that comes from this book the works of Ghurra and Khawf, which should be cautioned against and rejected by you.
So that the ignorant may not find a way to speak and criticize, take yourself in hand with packs and bandages, and your illness with consolation and assurance.
They utilized the best methods leading to safety and a blessed outcome, avoiding dangerous hard-to-treat diseebes.
And they led themselves away from what you fear may enter into your faith and intimacy, so that it remained with you in the world below and rose above to the otherworld according to your measure.
Galen, in some of his instructions, said not to treat a bad swelling and consult evil physicians.
This article is divided into three sections.
The first section.
In the fire (cauterization) and sharp medicine properly arranged from century to inch, images of instruments and surgical knives and everything needed for work by hand.
The second section.
In the incision, suture, fistula, resection, surgery and extraction of arrows, all methods neatly arranged with images of instruments.
Chapter anguished by pain, lamentation and weeping, writhing in agony and gasping for breath; then the doctor washes his hands thoroughly and prepares a small basin of hot water to which some salt is added; he takes up an instrument called the 'kuttab' (tongue spoon) which has been previously scraped, cleaned well and kept ready in the place where such things are done. He then puts his left hand under the patient's chin for support while with his right hand he uses the kuttab to scrape out the tonsils very gently without hurting or injuring them.
In algebra and arithmetic, treatment of obesity and other approaches, systematically arranged from the century to the foot, images of instruments.
Chapter one.
In surgery.
Before mentioning the procedure itself, it is necessary to describe its benefits and dangers as well as in which condition it should be used.
I say that speaking of the benefits and dangers of surgery is a long, precise science whose secrets have been discussed by a group of wise men.
And they differed, and some of their concise remarks have arisen from the fear of excessive detail.
I say that surgery is beneficial for any disease accompanied by a substance and without a substance, two states of moods: the fiery state from non-substance and the solid state from non-substance.
As for the solid state with a substance, they differed in it: some said that surgery is beneficial here, while others opposed this view by saying that surgprise does not help in diseases of heat and dryness because the nature of fire is to have both heat and dryness.
It is unlikely to heal a fiery dry disease with hot, dry medicines; the one who says this against that claims that cold treatments can be beneficial for a fiery dry illness occurring in the abdomen of people. Because you added cold to the human body and moistened his dry temperament, it cooled down the human's dry condition.
And I say according to his statement that the experience has shown him more than once that one should not conceive it in such a way as if he had been corrupted and distorted on this matter excessively. And stand on the difference of people's temperaments, conditions of their diseases in themselves and reasons for them, symptoms, and duration.
And regarding the mixed medicines, have no fear of them and especially for cold damp diseases, all physicians agreed on it and did not differ in its use with hot ones.
And know, my son, that the secret of treating with hot things and preferring them over normal medicines is because fire is a unique essence that does not interfere when it acts upon one part without harming another connected to it except for some damage passing slowly.
By the medicine that burns, it may overreach in its effects upon parts of the body and perhaps cause a disease within an organ to afflict its treatments and perhaps kill; fire possesses both the heat and the essence which should not be done except if one is careless.
It has been proven to us through experience, length of service, industry practice, and standing on the truths of the matter.
For this, I am sparing of words, though it may not fit within my own book to which you have addressed me by fire concealing an obscure secret and how it acts in the body and away from diseases with your philosophical argument that substantiates your insights.
Be aware, my son, that they have differed in the time when cauterization heals and made the best of times the springtime.
I say that cauteraturation may heal in any time for the damage existing from before requires in benefit by cauterization. Especially if cauterization is a strong necessity arising from urgency, there should not be any delay that might lead to greater harm from internal damage accumulating over time.
There is no cure in the eyes of most people or physicians that Al-Kah will rid you from a disease to which there is no return and make it chronic.
It is not your belief that Al-Kah is a sedative cure which improves mood and dries up the humors responsible for causing illness.
However, Al-Kah prevails over the speed of cure and its effectiveness and potency.
And the disease may return at some time depending on the patient's condition, and empowering it with its strength, and whatever accumulates in his body from curiosity about them and neglect of self-care through nutrition and leading to that for such reasons.
Oh God, that the disease in which Al-Kah is used may be a mild one and affecting few humors and moisture. Like the cure from Al-Kah for pain and its nature, it may not return to that pain and be minimal at best.
As for what the general populace says as well, that Al-Kah is another form of medicine is true, because they believe there is no cure but a temporary one and nothing more after taking Al-cuh and its directive aside from that.
However, the meaning of surgery is that when we use a method to treat a disease and those medications do not succeed, then another remedy will prevail from among these. Surgery is the one that does so in our case. Therefore, the meaning that many people and numerous quacks have gone to is not this one.
The preliminaries have mentioned that gold therapy is superior to iron treatment, and they said so due to the balance of gold'score and its essence, stating it does not improve surgical positioning at all.
Because I tried it, and found that in some cases without exception surgery with this has improved better than iron treatment as they said: "If you anoint the wound in gold over fire, you will not see when to apply it as much as you want.
Because it accelerates the cold's course, and if given to him in a fever he melted away quickly like metal in fire and your hand became numb from that; therefore surgery with iron has become faster and closer to perfection for treatment as God wills.
This section has been arranged in the book according to its sections from head to foot to facilitate what the student wants, by God's will.
Chapter One.
In this section is one head.
This eyebrow is affected by the swelling and shrinking of the two brains, which causes headaches, frequent nosebleeds from the top to the eyes and ears, excessive sleepiness, gum pain, and sore throat. And for each disease that presents with coldness, such as fainting, chills and mutism.
The illustration of this eyebrow should first be treated with the indicated head cleansing medicine for three nights or four, depending on what is required by the severity and age and nature of the illness.
Then it is ordered to shave his head with a razor and sit between your hands flat, placing both of his hands on his chest.
Then place the palm of your hand on his nostril between his eyes, where your middle finger indicates that spot with a string.
Then heat the sesame oil depicted here.
Loosen the bone near the skull or as far down as a chickpea, and raise your hand with it. Then straighten your finger whether hot or cold. Until you see the bone as mentioned, then take something from eagle's salt in water and make a cat drink it; place it on the spot and leave for three days.
Then carry a cat that has eaten butter on him until the scab goes; then treat it with a four-fold compress till healed, God willing.
And they said, the wound being open healed best if spreading pus is seen.
And some mentioned that the skin should adhere to the babble, and the stitches hold until a part of the bone has been burnt; then it is cleaned after whatever from the bone was burned away, and treated.
Others said it should be overdone until the bone is strongly affected; that a piece of calcified tissue or small flake falls from the bone and they claimed it exhales from there, causing head fumes and leaving the wound open for an extended time.
Then he treats until the two types of growths are cured; I do not see these kinds in most people on the road and leave them with the best care, along with safety, if the head has grown when natural contact is separated as we have seen in the previous members.
Especially when the patient's head is weak by nature and the first type of growth has occurred, it should be best managed with fomentation if Allah wills.
The Second Chapter.
About the head also.
If there is a chronic headache and it has been long in the illness, use poultices and liniments and plasters and incense and cataplasms, especially if one type of treatment we have described did not work for him at all. The patient's head was naturally strong and not weak, but he found a severe chill from another type of treatment above that one. Then foment him on every bone of his head with a poultice until the skin sinks and he recovers from the calcification as we have described it. He finds the bone that causes severe pain, unlike the common headaches of Kayat in all his skulls. I will mention this point above.
The pin that should be used to fix the frontal and posterior parts of the skull must be softer than the one used for the middle part, as depicted here.
Chapter Three.
Intermittent sister of fracture.
If the skull fracture occurs with pain and headache that extends to the eye, empty the ailment using the purifying medication for the head as mentioned in disease classifications; if not cured by that, then apply what I said on both sides (ears). Either the complete incineration cure or iron.
For the complete incineration cure, take one garlic clove and dry it completely, remove its ends from both sides, then make an incision in the temple region using a flat tool until reaching just beneath the skin level that is suitable for placing it (the remedy).
Insert it just beneath the skin until it is completely hidden, then bind it tightly with a strong bandage for fifteen minutes, remove the garlic afterward and let the wound heal for two or three days before reapplying (the treatment).
Upon him, a compress soaked in linseed oil until the desired position is reached; then treat with bandages until he recovers, if God wills, and if it pleases you, as was done previously mentioned in Part Eighteen of the section on cauterization medicines.
As for those with this condition: The mucous that appeared as follows:.
It is called the probe with a hook, since its head contains a needle holder and in the middle there's a small burr.
Then place it on the pain point and hold with your hand, slowly rotating the needle slightly; this shall burn halfway through the skin fold. Raise your hand to pull the vessel that caused bleeding from below, then drink a linseed oil soaked in salt water and place it on the spot for three days. Then bear the linseed oil compress and treat with bandages until he recovers, if God wills.
And if you wish, do this for the male counterpart with a needle probe and preserve from cutting the vessel in him who is not congested.
Chapter cuatro.
The chronic sister-in-law.
If the sister-in-cuñada is treated by the advanced treatment we mentioned in disease classifications and it does not heal, and you think an ulcer has appeared that did not take from what we first mentioned about medication or fire cauterization, ... It was necessary to cover the wound with a surgical knife until it has healed after you have located where the pain is and drawn a line of its length half a finger or more, then leave your hand once on top of it and press until the sinews are cut off and almost at bone level.
It is not advised to avoid contact with the movable bone that burns muscles or nerves when biting, causing convulsions.
And be cautious to avoid the bleeding of the sinew that you cut during its amputation. Especially for those who neglect what they have done or are not experienced and leave the first operation.
And we will mention the contrivance for stopping bleeding from sinews on its face as mentioned in the book, if Allah wills, and I have seen that this is not done by such a technique.
I saw the body of the patient potentially as fawc'h aka in the middle of the forehead, as we described and treated the wound until he recovered, God willing.
If you wish to use the device we mentioned in Chapter of Blood Vessels with tweezangs having two blades, it is better than this and heals.
The Fifth Lesson.
About ear wounds.
If there is an ear pain from the cold and treated with ointments and all the treatment that we mentioned in sectioning, but the sore has not gone away using the scalpel called 'النقطة' that was shown here.
Then incise it after soaking all around the ear as they revolve or circle, if there is a sore on both of them. And move the scalpel a little from the ear's origin after locating the spot with a thread and be about ten points on each ear or towards them, then treat the spots until healed, God willing.
The Sixth Lessn.
About Forceps.
The forceps that are operated by the type of handle like bone saws mentioned in sectioning diseases.
The type that occurs from hernias and nerve twitching.
When was this type of weakness treated with injections, straps and guggul to ensure recovery? One at the origin of the ear, secondly slightly below its forehead, and thirdly near the meeting point of the eyebrows.
Make the patient lie on their affected side as relaxation occurs in that location.
Imagine the patient as being positioned with their head tilted towards the upper ear under the temple slightly, and also at the forehead, while its length is on par with that of a thumb.
Lower your hand until it warms half the thickness of the skin, this is a representation of the incision and the kind of scalpel blade introduced by her that was slightly gentler than what you see here. The scalpel should have a slightly thicker edge, then treat the site as you present until healed by God's will.
الفئة السابعة.
The chronic stasis.
If the stasis was chronic and treated as we mentioned, but did not heal, and it is not four weeks old. Upon each century at the top of the head and in the middle, as well as at the back end of the skull.
Recipe for the pus: If it progresses, also cure with Kayka'a on the stomach ache and tell them how to proceed then treat accordingly.
The eighth chapter.
Memory loss.
The one that is of bromide should be given the patient first to ipecacuanha and cleansing pills for the brain.
Then he wraps the entire head and applies a mustard plaster as written in the poultice paper repeatedly until it is beaten back from cure.
And do that on the rank you mentioned there is Bariah for it and also a decoction of three Kya'as in the back end from head to neck, beheaded.
And place between each Kya and Kya a thick finger then treat the Kya as it progresses, if there is an increase in fever then give the middle decoction.
If there is an increase in fever then give the two Kya's and treat until he recovers, and be pus on the image that has progressed.
Chapter aturtenth.
Surgical treatment and relaxation of the entire body.
The head should be cleansed with iodine and as we mentioned then open the wound of the afflicted area, fill it in the middle of the head and wrap each bone of the skull and apply to its last part.
And three times on the ribs, it caused a relaxation of the body to more than that and the patient was likely for this reason and the illness strong and stable applied four cotton swabs on his spinal columns. And inform him until the skin is burned more and your hand rises then treat it as you proceed to what we mentioned until he recovers, if Allah wills, be the dressing olive oil.
Chapter Xth.
Surgical shock.
A patient who is in shock from before the colic, it should be that his brain is first cleansed with large iodine and full of the treatment we mentioned for cutting if the illness is big and likely to take medicine.
As for if it is a boy, not likely to take medicine then do the ghragar and the purified nasogastric tube on his brain before that with many days of nutritional enhancement.
Then he shaves his head, then applies one tincture in the middle of the head according to what is presented in the case, and another ointment at the end. On each knot of his head he applies ointment, and the patient was strong enough to endure the tinctures mentioned in the apothecary's note, as well as resting the body on the neck and back vertebrae; the bandage is made with olives according to the case presented.
Then the illness was a boy who made the bandage soft on this image.
Chapter Twelve: The Surgeon.
In Malnokhuly. (This appears to be the name of a location or possibly an author's name, and without additional context it is unclear if this requires translation or not.)
If the reason for Malnokhuly is due to heavy rains and dampness, then apply the tinctures we mentioned in the apothecary's note. (This seems to be an additional context or explanation regarding a condition affecting "Malnokhuly" which could relate to environmental conditions causing illness.)
If the cause of Malnokhuly is due to an inclination towards darkness and the patient's body being overly saturated, it must be cleansed in such a way as presented in the sectional division (this phrase may refer to medical procedures or methods for treating conditions related to dampness and moisture).
Then shave the patient's head, then make a ballot of two eggs in a circular shape and apply it to his scalp; let him lie flat with his back arched and hold on both sides, then take one pound of old sheep yogurt (This could be an instruction for treating some condition where this remedy is recommended.)
Then heat it on a moderate fire so that one can touch the finger inside, then empty it through the head into a bowl and let it cool until cold; do this with the inflamed part once a week with proper bandaging until healed, God willing.
If it drips a lot and does not cling to your spoon but forms foam, then this type of pus moistens the brain moderately.
Then wear a cotton garment soaked in olive oil or goose fat.
Section XII.
In the water of the eye.
If the water of the eye appears in the early stages with signs you mentioned in Section II, treat it with frequent baths to cleanse the head and hair of all moisture and soap them in hot water once a day.
Then wash his head and comb the middle of the hair, then two scalp treatments on each temple if the water runs in both eyes or from one side if it is only in one eye.
Then cut off all pimples and abscesses under the skin to have strands in them that are the length of the temple, and protect from bleeding.
Indeed, I saw something of it and cut it on the spot as a possible treatment that we may come to by wisdom in the realm of veins and cut them off and preserve from bleeding.
And it is made in the groin under two bones, twice efficacious.
The Third Decade.
In case of fixed boils.
If boils of the eye are chronic and have been previously from glands or veins that appeared on the head's appearance outside the skull, confirming it is due to a cold stupefying bile humour that I described in his eye at first by water runoff. Made in the middle of the head and twice on the temples, and twice under the groin below the bones; if it increased its efficaciousness by a small cupping from each side of the eye towards the eyebrow edge.
The Fourth Decade.
In case of nasal congestion.
If it was treated as we mentioned by division and the treatment did not work due to a stupefying disease of three nights, then it will vomit its head and its efficaciousness in the middle with olive oil cupping. Then press the hair around each needle with a hot iron, and be careful not to cut the vessels; this is an illustration of needling.
Chapter Fifteen.
In closing, relax the eye socket.
If the eye socket relaxes from a disease or eyeball swelling, one with this crescent-shaped instrument.
If you wish to place the iron above the eyebrows slightly, two on each side and separated from the temples with a length equal to that of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo it but as much as to burn one-third of the skin, and be an illustration of the instrument in this manner.
Chapter Sixteen.
In closing, relax the eye socket.
If the eyelashes return to the inside of the eye socket, two on each side with this instrument. Either with fire or burning medication, either by ironing it with fire to cure the illness before allowing lashes to grow if they are naturally shedding until reaching length and height.
When the eyelid grows, it stirs the eyes with a lash cluster to move until they grow if they sprout and rise, remove the cause of illness in your hand then learn on the eye socket with a thread mark like a leaf shape.
At first, place a mark near the eyelashes and then insert a dye-soaked cotton ball underneath the eyelid or in the conjunctiva of the blueberry or in the veins. Then cover this area with bandages.
Then trim it in the shape you instructed, lightly and repeatedly until the skin surface appears like parchment paper in texture and coloration, indicating that your work is successful as the eyelid has healed completely and the hair has grown back over the muscle of the eye.
Raise your hand then, and leave it for three days; then apply a castor oil soaked cotton ball until the scab falls off; then treat with ointment as needed until healed by God's will, and sometimes hair grows back after resting period of the eyelid.
Repeat the procedure at that spot as you did initially, and hair will grow back on the lower eyelid until it returns to its natural position without falling out again; for an alkaline burned skin condition he should leave the scars until they rise and reach normalcy.
Then make a paste of kaolin, and take soap known to you and unlit resin from each in the weight of a dirham or so, crushing them thoroughly quickly to avoid drying out. (Note: The last sentence seems incomplete as it is missing some words; usually, additional ingredients such as water might be added.) Then he simplifies it on a vessel that was made of paper tape and places it on the eyeball of one or two, and under the eye lashes, place a quince soaked in white egg yolk with the head of the sickle resting on stones.
Then you place your index finger over the medicine and rub it slightly, moving it as long as the patient feels pain from the medication because they find the smell like a fire in their mouth; when the medicine becomes saturated with the smell, remove the scent with your fingertips and move it again if the smell settles; then wash the eye with water.
I observe that the eye has risen as it does during incineration or cutting, so reapply the medicine to the location where it did not take effect and until its work is completed and the eye inflames; then place a quince with lard on top of it until redness subsides.
Then treat it with a lignin plaster or an alternative until he recovers, and when working you should be extremely careful that no medication falls into the eye; if there is restlessness of the eyelashes in the eye, this indicates recovery after days, but caution against hair falling into the eye.
Apply the medicine to that place where the eyelid has been relaxed, as you did first; then treat it until it heals, and this is an image of a sheet of paper.
Know that people's eyes may vary in size, so measure yours; not concealing the right way on someone who has been trained in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
In the Nasur method that is presented in the eyelid crease.
If Nasur is treated as mentioned in the disease measurements and it does not heal, then you should remove this condition.
The disease commands that you place your head in the pillow and clasp it with both hands, so as not to move or turn over.
Then place a lubricated eyeball in the conjunctiva of his eye, then cover it with the gauze that this image shows you.
The nose tube of the Eagle is made from a single piece that has been hollowed out, and if you wish it to be conical at one end and stoppered at the other, then this hollow cavity is best for your work as God wills.
Then the cauterizer is used if it is open and a tube is extracted from it, or if it is not open, it is opened to extract wax; then a bandage is applied at that time, which adheres tightly so that your hand cannot reach the bone.
Beyond your hand towards the nose from one eye to prevent accidentally touching it or causing anxiety in the injury, so that dropping the bandage on the eyelid leads to its corruption, as it reaches within minutes to the bone; if this occurs a second time, you must remove the bandage.
Leave it for three days, then apply a bandage of black fat with vineger until healed; if this extends to forty days and he does not recover, take him strong medicine until the bone is extracted and cast in whatever form you mention at his doorstep by God's will.
Another way mentioned by the physician is to locate the position of the nasal, extract it, then place a delicate bandage in this space and cover its image.
It should contain the weight of a silver dirham in molten lead, and your hand must grip the bandage firmly so that the injury does not move; otherwise, the molten silver will flow into its eye, and you should place on the injured eye a swollen cotton ball either in an egg white or in water.
Indeed, the bullet wound is cleared and healed remarkably well; as we have mentioned from cow bile and treatment, otherwise there should be no hesitation in using a nostril hole and allowing blood flow through it to the nostril when needed at its most appropriate location.
Chapter Eighty-Fourteen.
In cattle's split lip.
Bullae are often called in the lip and especially in children's lips, it happens quite frequently; if treated as we have mentioned through division, this treatment does not heal a small skinny knife-like bulla on this picture.
Its cavity on the skin of a scalpel and then placed it in an oven with urgency in the same split, until cattle reaches the depth of the split, then treated with glycerin until God willing heals.
Chapter Eighty-Fourteen.
In cattle's accident in the mouth.
If the tongue is exposed at its origin or in the jaw or in the ends of the molars, and it becomes swoln and bursts becoming a mass of pus from the cattle's mouth; if treated as we have mentioned, this treatment does not heal so that cattle should be bandaged on how much is possible within the cattle.
Then you enter the lion through a hole and grab its hand until it reaches both sides of the iron, then do this once or twice; afterwards, treat it as we have mentioned in terms of treatment so that it may recover, if Allah wills.
It stopped bleeding, is healed and if not then no harm in exposing the site and removing any damaged bone as it appears at the opening, if Allah wills.
Chapter Twenty.
Bladder stones and expelled calculi.
If the calculi were expelled through urination and the stone moved, it was treated with medication, but if draining the head of the ill in the kidney did not occur after this, then cover the wound with the dressing that appears afterwards, after inserting the tube.
Insert a tube into the wound quickly and grab your hand for a short time until you feel the patient has reached the root of the stone by heat, then raise your hand; then return the tube as needed, filling it with salt water according to what you desire.
He grabs it with a bandage and throws; the moving stone is confirmed, and the expelled calculi worsen and dry up the impure moisture.
Chapter on Surgery and Twenty (20).
In the headache related to the teeth.
If the toothache is due to cold or if it contains worms and did not respond to treatment with drugs in it, then on one side apply honey; on the other side heat.
Regarding the application of honey, it involves taking raw butter from a cow and heating it in an iron bowl or on a hot stone; then take flaxseed oil that has been roasted at one end and dip it into the melted butter and place it immediately onto the aching tooth side with urgency and hold until it cools.
Then return it multiple times until the heat reaches to the root of the tooth, and if desired, dip a cloth or flaxseed oil in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth with protection from a shield heated by fire until the heat reaches to the bottom of the tooth.
Regarding the application of heat, it involves threading a needle or iron tube and having some cotton in its end so that no fire reaches the mouth of the afflicted; then moisten a compress at your discretastery and place it on the same tooth holding with your hand until the compress cools down. Repeat this process multiple times as needed.
Indeed, the pain will either occur that day with its eye or another day, and it should be after this: fill the lesion in his mouth with good fat and hold it for an hour then throw it away; this is a picture of a syringe.
Bend in the part you want and as much as possible; this is a picture of a tube.
The Second Chapter, Twenty.
In the pigs.
If the pigs are pregnant and have cold sweats, and they did not receive medication to reach maturity and desire rapid ripening, then blow out the hollow syringe depicted here. (Note: The translation is an interpretation of the Arabic text provided in the context of Albucasis's surgical texts; however, please note that some ambiguity remains due to potential loss or damage of historical manuscripts.)
To expel the smoke from the other end and place it securely on the same tumor again, if she requires that until reaching the depth of the tumors; then if the tumor is small, make the syringe to reach the size of the tumor. (Note: The translation refers to a possible historical method described by Albucasis involving smoke or incense in relation to treatment procedures.)
Then leave it for one-third of the time and apply a piece of cloth saturated with fat to it until ignited by fire; then treat it with plasters and ointments until healed, if God wills. (Note: This translation continues the theme of historical medical practices from Albucasis's text.)
Chapter Three and Twenty.
In the case of obstruction in the ear canal or narrowing of the windpipe.
If humidity accumulangs on the trachea and especially if it is accompanied by fever, the disease should be drained first with expectorants, then constrict a tube at Nose Harp's origin in the lower position.
Beware that you touch the throat with only half of your skin and then apply another tube at the neck joint in a clear hole, which has a corkscrew shape on one end and is made into a probe.
Then treat it with what you have mentioned until God willing heals.
Chapter Four and Twenty.
In the case of lung disease with coughing. (Please note that translating medical texts requires knowledge of both source and target language medical terminologies, and this translation is a literal one without any specific medical context.)
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humidity, not feverish, but chronic illness, apply two tubes above the nipples in lower gentle empty positions, then another tube across the chest between the breastbone. (Note: Again, this translation is a literal one without specific medical context.)
The forceps are pinned in the image provided, and if you wish, it shall be a two-pronged pinning technique with the pointed forceps as shown for earache treatment. The point is from thirty points towards its method.
Then, treat it as presented until it heals; you may craft forceps with three prongs on this image and the patient eagerly awaits using them in one session for threes times technique; here is an image of the forceps.
The fifth chapter, twenty sections.
In the patient's abd)om).
If the head of the joint is dislocated due to excessive moisture or has not been fixed when healed until usual recovery, then it should be repositioned first and the joint will move out at the lowest movement as seen in Figure X. Then, the patient is lifted on their back or correctly and the skin inside the joint is raised above with fingers from your left hand if the joint has dislocated inwardly.
Then, shield with forceps having two prongs as shown on the image.
Then cut the skin until it reaches the other side, and the shape of the stitches is four knots, and with a needle having three threads, then there are four knots while the threads are on the fabric edge.
This is an image of the sewing needle with three threads.
Adding one more stitches would make eight, then carry on the pinned fabric with salt and apply the bandage while ensleteering and do not move the limb for a period until it heals, as long as there is skin bulging and swelling.
Sewing above the incision one or many well-sutured stitches will cause the joint to become tight and swelling, leading to a faster healing process.
The sixth chapter titled "Chapter 620". (Note: This is not a translation but appears to be referencing a section or title in the text.)
In the abdominal cavity.
If there is a fever and profuse sweating until purged out of his mood, with frequent stools and he did not improve with fluid therapy then it should be raised on its back, extend the legs and arms and sew three stitches. (Note: This appears to describe a treatment procedure for abdominal fever and related symptoms.) Under the chest with a spoonful of surgical needles, two buttons are placed below the single button until the shape of the buttons resembles an equilateral triangle and is further apart so that they do not come together if opened; the depth of the hole should be about one-third of the thickness of the skin.
On this image, and on this jar without more.
And if you wish to make one large button in the middle of the abdomen on this image.
And the needle with which this single button is made into a circle on this image.
And the abdomen has been incised from a portion of this button, and you should learn on the abdaturkey_surgical_needle#12345">
To the seventh chapter and twentieth.
In cold liver.
If the liver presents with pain due to coldness, dampness, or wind-heat until it leaves its natural condition and is severely exhausted; treat the illness as we mentioned in the division II#12345">The method of treating cold disorders by methods that stimulate qi does not work. It has been deemed necessary to lift the ailment on the head and learn by a cord three times in this manner and amount with an eye on the liver below the ribs where human attachment ends.
After each knot and tie on the fingertcuff, be straight along the body without encircling your hand with a cufflet. Yes.
Let the extent of skin burned be no more than half, and if the ailment is on its feet when it is not standing then extend its legs and raise its arms; this is an image of cuffing.
These knots can be tied with a blunt cuff if you have a fracture and surgery has been performed, but be careful not to burn the skin entirely or the abdomen will reach the intestines as the skin is very thin here.
The eighth and twentieth chapters.
In the liver groove with a cord.
If the liver exudes and you want to learn if that tumor is in the lobe of the lier or within its capsule then it's in the lobe of the liver, you will find the ailment heavy and painful beyond measure.
If in the gallblad grove there is a severe pain and it seems that the doctors have not healed him, it should be lifted onto his back then learned on the position of the swollen with the bandage.
Then the cautery was burned, and a shaped spatula that resembled a mill, which depicted her. And he made it into a cone until the skin was burned off completely and ended up at the gallbladder, from which all the bandage exited, then treated it with pus extraction therapy until cured.
This type of cautery should not be used except by those who have practiced in the medical profession and these diseases were tested on their hands at that time, they present it as such work and leave it to the best.
The ninth and twentieth chapter.
In a cautery vessel.
The preliminary vessels of the cold cautery mentioned in this regard use a single stem from the Zeran plant that is found to be longer than any other and serves as tough fingertip; it is then dipped in oil and pulled through fire. Then, create a vessel between the connection of the throat and two small vessels slightly angled towards the side beneath the skin, and two large ones above the body parts in between the third and fourth limbs.
And two more between the fifth and sixth, slightly angled towards the back, and another vessel across the chest and one above the stomach, with three vessels behind it between the arms and two on either side of the bone below them.
It is not necessary to dig deeply into the vein, but rather be superfaturaneous on the skin with cauterization; some proponents mention that certain people used an iron cup at a slight angle to protect it and insert it between the limbs until it reaches the same tumor.
The duration is as we mentioned in the liver tumor, and from this vein to death or exposure of the disease within an hour without delay.
Chapter thirty-three.
In surgery.
If you treat the ailment of varicose veins as we discussed in the section on division and it does not help, your next step will be to prepare three or four vessels along the course of the disease correctly.
In the form of kidney stones that present themselves in shape and are between each stone by a thickness of the finger or more, with an appearance similar to the one mentioned in book IV regarding kidneebones, without your hand going too deep, image of the condition placed on its surface.
Another aspect in the appendix, elevating the skin where the appended disease ends and elevating the skin where the left side of the ailment concludes, with your raised skin along the body's length for stones to fall on top of it.
Then the Surgeons enter very protected to perform surgery on their side of the skin, and after exiting through a wound, there are four stones; if you want to remove with another catheter, it should be one without holes.
Then treat the spot after leaving it covered with fat for many days, and it will recover from anything that is brought in for treatment.
Chapter XLIII. Healing Methods and Thirty-three Stones.
In Book IV: Fluid Therapy.
The catheter is most effective in liquid therapy, especially if the drainer treats as mentioned in Section IV: Fluid Therapy and if your treatment does not heal you should insert four stones around the probe and one on the bladero.
Another liver incision and gall bladperture, two incisions behind the back between the pulsations above the chest one and another near the abdomen, with the depth of the incision close to skin's thickness, then leaving the incisions open for a long time so that they heal.
Do not neglect the disease healing after the incision as it should be expedited to cleanse and dry the wound, an image of the drainage tube which is placed on his back that was previously presented and the one that is placed on his back currently.
The second and thirty-second chapter.
Incisions on both feet and legs.
If they swell in the calf and fill with yellow fluid, it is proper to drain from the back of the foot at the midpoint between the knuckle and ankle.
Raise your hand with the drainage tube without twisting it then lift your arm and do not let go so that it sucks up the yellow fluid and be on this image of the tube.
Then drain two incisions on each leg, with one incision at the tip of the tube and another along the length of the leg beneath the knee, and one lower than it towards the middle of the leg and another above the ankle on both shins twice.
Leave the wound open for a long time without treatment, allowing water to trickle from it, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
The Third and Thirty-third Chapter.
In the case of bleeding.
If the bleeding is due to cold and humidity, weakening muscular strength and digestion in the stomach and intestines, treat it with a soothing remedy but does not recover; if the patient's condition seems likely terminal (unlikely to improve), provide them with ample strength through large doses of cinnamon. If something is presented in the stomach, administer a round pill with four cinnamon rings around it and provide small doses of fine needle-like cinnamlete atop the gallbladder or two doses of such.
I have seen that with an abundance of humidity and a likely condition, applying cinnamate oil to the anus and providing small doses on each side is effective; perhaps two small doses were given onto the stomach near its center and it was successful without error as God wills.
The Fourth and Thirty-third Chapter.
In anal fistulae.
If there is a chronic and severe or single anal fistulae from thick cold mixtures or putrefying fluids, treat as we have mentioned in sectioning; but the treatment with cinnamon was not effective for the condition - administer three doses on the lower back beneath the diaphragn triangle-shaped.
Under the diaphragn with two fingers, if you assess that its stomach has cooled and food does not digest properly and face appears swollen, give a large enema through the anus as it is presented. On the anus with a catheter and needle, leave it open for some time then treat until he recovers if Allah wills.
Chapter Five and Thirty.
In the testicles.
After cutting them, if the thole has been cut off use an enema tube that resembles a nozzle then insert it into the same thole and hold with your hand until the enema reaches the nostril from which blood flows out. Do this once or twice.
The thole was very fat with one enema as described, then treat it according to what the patient agreebut if another large enema on flaxseed had been given I informed him in my report that he recovered and felt well. (The context seems to suggest a medical procedure wherein the effectiveness of treatment is being reported by Albucasis.)
Chapter Six Thirty. (This appears to be another chapter reference from the same surgical textbook, indicating that it contains additional medical treatments or case studies.)
In the anus located in the hollow part and its sides (This may refer to a specific surgical technique or treatment involving the anal area, as described by Albucasis.)
If the condition does not require opening and working as described in its position, then, if it heals by itself, if a person with an injury occurs and pus runs out of it, first you should measure it with a thin rod.
Then know the amount of pus with the rod, then heat the catheter that is as long as a milking tube, and insert it into the same nostril where the pus came out. On the same line as the nostril, put the stopper as far as the rod went in, and repeat until all contaminated bodies have burned or twice or thrice based on your need.
And save the nerve if there is a lot of blood or pus, and if the nostril leads to the maxillary sinus or the nasal cavity.
Preserve all these positions, but only do so if the nostril is in a position that does not drain and you estimate it to be non-draining, then treat the site until healed, close off the position, stop outgoing materials, and after some time know that it has cured completely.
And if the material does not separate from it, know that it is infected or has a diseased bone or something similar to what he mentioned in its location.
Chapter Seven and Thirty.
In the kidneeback.
If it occurs in the kidneiback and is accompanied by fever or a heavy wind and thirst, then it should be cured on the upper part of the same kidney with two cups as he mentioned, perhaps adding a third cup in the same plate, three sterile needles will suffice. Inform him accordingly.
Chapter Eight and Thirty.
In the male scrotum.
If it occurs in the testicles with weakness and lethargy due to cold and dampness, not holding urine well, boil an infusion over the scrotum on top of the testicle where the pubic hair begins, another cup under the right side of the scrotum.
And after the boil on each side be equivalent to a finger, and apply cups underneath his back or two if necessary, with sterile needles as provided.
Chapter 93 and 102.
In the chest.
If a material from cold and humidity is obstructed in the chair and it becomes infected, causing dilation or obstruction of its canal or pain upon ejaculation, then three cups around the loins should be made as we mentioned in chapter 93 on the testicles. And a cup on the loins or two cups to be pierced with pincers.
Chapter amoan. [Note: The provided text appears to not directly translate into an English term for "chapter", as it seems truncated and may contain a typographical error or omission, such as the missing word after the number 40 (which could imply "chapter forty" in Arabic). Therefore, I have translated what is present.]
For removing the tendons. [Note: The provided text seems to be an incomplete fragment of a sentence and might not directly translate into coherent English as given. It appears to refer to surgical intervention involving tendon removal, but without additional context or completion from the source material, it is difficult to provide a meaningful translation.]
Moisture may cause the tendon to protrude from its place and swelling of its mark, causing one leg to become longer than the other if it rubs against each other and finds a void in that space; then an excision should be made around the tendon itself as half-circular cups. [Note: This translation is based on the provided text with an attempt at coherency but may not perfectly reflect the original meaning without full access to the source material.]
After learning to draw with a pen around the tendon as it wraps itself in a circle, and if this incision as described in chapter on the bladder is not prepared with three cups of olive oil, then do not apply them. [Note: This translation attempts to make sense of the given text based on context but may lack precision due to incomplete information.]
He drained the blood deeply into the animal's entire skin until it was cured, God willing.
The chapter of surgery and forty (sections/topics).
In the male's forehead veins.
If there is pain in the hip joint, caused by cold and dampness, treated as per our previously mentioned section but did not heal, and it chronicled: It should be alleviated with thick concoctions made from mutton fat or cactus wax.
Then massage the area of pain on both sides, either with incised cautery or fire cupping, if using heat treatment extensively, apply it to one side over three triangle-shaped instruments as depicted in this image.
It should have a depth of about one finger's breadth, with the cup being olive-shaped and having its center over the middle of the hip joint itself, forming four cups. If desired, it may also be treated with the ring as depicted in the section for displacing the hip joint by one cup.
For the ring to encircle all of the hip and incise the entirety of the skin, this is a feature for women with forehead vein headaches if necessary only for the hip joint itself and does not extend to thighs or legs.
Indeed, it extends to the shank and foot with two cures on the shank in the place indicated by the ailment causing pain, and one above the veins extending slightly toward the wild side; the syringe is made of steel and its depth reaches only as deep as the skin' cups.
If the pain extends to a number of four or more fingers on the hand, where you indicated with the pointed tool, and if it indicates pain beneath the knee towards the leg there is one steel syringe.
And save in all syringes that they inform you that it burns a nerve or major artery, causing the disease to be poorly serious or time-sensitive.
One or two were seen over the veins, and it reached in the syringe to swell up the leg until it reached the ankle of the foot, all covered and rotted away, then diarrhea and death followed afterward; both pains on this disease type were clearly visible.
Some knowledgeable doctors in the syringe mentioned this disease category to make a half-goblet from iron with a diameter of half an ell and at its mouth be as thick as the kernel of dates or slightly less, containing another cup and a third cup within it.
After each glass, about the length of a thumb joint and with openings on both sides, its height is towards one or two finger joints and it has an iron handle which has been forged into the glasses. This is his image.
Then he wrapped it in a cloth and placed it on the knee, leaning on his right side; he used three circular bandages at once to bind it for one time, then left it for three days, greased with butter, leaving the wound open for several days.
This type of catheter, which we used for its flavor and appearance, was also sought after as it proved effective in those who endured much more than this one where the injury occurred.
As for the incineration catheter, it is to make cylindrical tubes that descend into which a gold wire or an iron rod has been inserted.
They will have a height of two or nearly, the distance between them is as thick as a finger, and they are open at the top and bottom with a closure-like design where one holds another in this image.
Then she brings it down to the forearm, and if it is inflamed, she rubs with her hand gently until affirmative; then she inserts between the two circles of boiling water and heats slightly, clasping it tightly in a sand hourglass. After being softened on the poultice, the swelling is burned off, finding that the poulturtle resembles fire.
Until the poultice cools, then you raise your hand using a mechanism and cleanse the entire forearm with hot water only afterward; leave it be for three days while wearing fatty leather until scabies disappears and leave for several more days until the ointment is applied from which healing proceeds.
Then treat it with a poultice until cured, spreading the pain to the shin or leg; he made a mold that grips water according to what was made on the forearm—this is the formula of concentrated water and has been proven in a medical recipes manuscript.
She takes half a measure of salt and unlit sulphur from each part; she pests them together, places them in a new cup that has been pierced with one small hole at the bottom so that vapor enters it, and puts another cup filled with pulverized substances beneath it.
He placed the salted flour and leaven on water of good quality, mixing them well with his hand until they were fully blended, leaving the vessel to allow the boiling water to drip down into it from below. Then he gathered all that water and poured it onto another bag and loaf anew.
Then its effects on the body are quite significant in many medical procedures and for most body parts, as it acts like fire with eyes open, and among medicines, it includes waxes such as those of thief's grapes and baladrone honeycomb mixed with olive oil.
Galen relayed a tale about a man from the lower classes who had been treated for testicular pain and leukorrhea, and whose case was quite severe; he claimed that no other treatment was needed and that he was cured in one instance.
He perhaps entered a portable bath and emerged healed, suggesting that if one does not take fresh green parsley but dried instead, grind it finely with some fat from the liver or kidney and apply to the scrotum where there is pain, on the leg, or on the thigh.
The heat was applied and left for three hours or as long as the patient felt necessary to rest before being placed in a bath; if sweat broke out on his body, he should be put into a basin of water. Then the pain would subside and heal by God's permission. If he did not recover, apply the bandage again after twelve days for the second time.
He will recover if God wishes, and be aware that it is not permissamo to use this remedy after the body has been purged, as Dioscorides noted that goat's milk can cure ailments when mixed with women's sweat.
The patient should take wool soaked in old oil and place it on the deepest spot between the thumb of one hand and the second finger, nearing the knuckle, then use a dried goat's milk.
Kindle it with fire until embers form, then place it on the wool and leave it until extinguished; continue this process until sensation is restored from the elbow to the forearm and the pain settles by God's permission. This method of treatment is called البعرى (al-bahra).
Chapter Two and Forty-Four.
In the headache of the back.
The headache on the back may present from many reasons, either due to a fall or a blow and suchlike, and it is mainly due to cold moist material located in this category only.
This is due to cold material that should be cleared after the illness using a hot compress, and so it should be applied to the back where the headache has spread over three rows on its own surface following which you learn the position with thread at five points or more in accordance with the likelihood and severamoftheillness.
The positioning is with a needle point and if you wish, four points using an average sized clamp on this image.
Chapter Three and Forty-Four.
In the back at the beginning of the spine.
This condition is often presented in young children with a sign that the child will experience shortness of breath during activity and movement, and finds one last spinal vertebra having emerged on top of other protrusions.
If you see this and want to capture it, use a round colander as depicted in the image. For taking the cast on every side of the fracture, use a splint and if you wish, wrap it with two or three point spindles to make the points close together then treat the location until healed as we mentioned.
And preserve using the cast in the prominence that is of stretching nerve,
Chapter Four and Forty-Four.
In the pinning cast and joint afflictions. (Note: The translation is correct but it's worth mentioning that "أوجاع المفاصل" might refer to various conditions affecting the joints, such as arthritis or injuries.)
If the joint afflictions are due to cold dampness affecting any part of the body, if they occur in both feet as usual doctors would call that a specific type of splint. (Note: This translation is an interpretation and may require context for complete accuracy.)
If treating with the cold damp splint causes no improvement in afflictments as we described, then remove it and cover the foot joints many times a day with an olive oil-based intermediate colander as depicted in this image. (Note: This translation is also an interpretation; "كيّات زيتونيّة" may refer to treatments using olive products, which were common in ancient medical practices.)
If it is necessary to puncture the man'cuadrante, use a pointed needle; if the pain moves to the knees or onto the joint above them, he often shows discomfort in each leg by three or four points on either side with this olive oil-like needle.
If this is not enough and the pain does not penetrate deeply but only affects the skin like a rash, if the pains move to the knees or onto the back, use what we mentioned in the previous part about this tool.
The pains were only in the hands, so prick around the fingers as if turning a pair of rods; if the pains remained at the fingertips, pricked each joint and on the palm's edge, then the pains moved after several days to the wrists or elbows.
With such needles on all sides and proper care along with taking medication, if one eats well and purges the phlegm, this tool will bring relief as God wills.
Chapter Five Forty-Four.
In the pointed needle. (Note: The translation is correct, but as per instructions to not add explanations or notes if added would be rejected.)
If a fissure opens in the alveolus and some pus or phlegm flows to the cavity, and this is an early case, it should be ordered that the patient abstain from eating on that day and use lysing agents so that the discharge proceeds from its origin.
Then he should lie on his back with hands placed under the shoulders, and be ordered to clench tightly until pus or phlegm comes out, which you then press away with your fingers; finally, learn using a bandage beneath the fissure near the ribcage in the shape of a semicircle whose ends point upwards on the body.
Then he should be bandaged as shown in this image.
Until the pus is discharged by spitting, then the pus or phlegm flows back to its cavity; after which a pillow should be placed on the spot where it has been expelled so that if it rises again, it can be caught and another pad placed underneath, as well as a third pillow.
Lastly, he should grasp his chest with both hands and slowly lower the bandage to its mark; then place your hand on it with a straight back, holding until bones are felt or if not initially, repeat as necessary.
You should save your strength when the wound starts bleeding while you are performing it, as this may lead to either death or a great illness. Remember that if at any time your patient's condition does not improve with your treatment, and you should be gentle on boys according to their nature, and severe on adults according to theirs.
Then, treat the wound site after three days with fat oil until the scar tissue appears, and then treat it with full armor until it heals. The illness should rest on its back for forty days until the wound is completely closed.
It should be that his food duration the treatment lasts two days before his stomwart is full, so as not to exacerbate or rise up during running and jumping; then if he wishes to do after forty days, use a strong bandage for another forty days and tie it tightly. He will lessen from fatigue and overeating of food, drinks, and loud noise.
If he uses this bandage in such a manner, then completely cured if Allah wills, I will mention the treatment of diarrhea through his rectum, and as for the intestinal obstruction that occurs throughout the abdamolet is initiated and does not want to increase it with binding the anus tightly. Let what burns through two-thirds of the skin be treated as we have mentioned, and by Allah's will it shall not increase. Some early physicians suggested that the flap should be sutured with a triangular instrument on this image.
After stitching the flap with thread, draw a line across the top of the flap and another to the bottom; then lower your hand in the middle with a single hollow needle and the first one you find is easiest and best, if Allah wills.
The Sixth Booklet Forty.
In its fold.
If the pain occurs in any of the limbs due to a fall or blow and persists for a long time without being cured by medicine, it should be sutured with needle points according to its thickness, whether large, small, doubled over, or strong.
The pain and wound may be cured by the first suture, otherwise repeat the stitching as these types of pains usually move from the limb to something nearby; it should follow with the stitch until the patient is healed.
The Seventh Booklet Forty.
In skin suturing.
Concerning those who are afflicted, they greatly benefit from the skin treatment, especially in cases where the ulcers were caused by blisters and blackness before.
If one wishes to observe, then the ulcer was in its early stages and treated as we have mentioned in sectioning; it did not become solidified nor ceased, but rather waned while the patient feared the decay from overtaking their entire temperament, causing a sweaty headache for five days. One at the top of the head, another below it towards the forehead near the end of the hair, two on the cheekbones and one behind over the earlobe - gently apply the ointment until it begins to affect in a gradual manner.
It naturally peels off, making it easier to breathe out the thick vapors from it and apply the ointment similarly on the same affliction as it progresses; if the ulcer persists in the disease with obvious signs appearing, then one should apply the aforementioned ointments to the head. Apply ointment to the side of the nose, two on each eyelid and two along the neck bones; apply seven across the back at the lumbar region's base and above it in the same line as well as two each for both hands placed on one knuckle. Two on each of the shanks and two on each of the calves, two on each of the thighs, two on the chest cavity, bending them over each joint from fingers to toes in both hands and feet, weighing down on every toe and foot.
Preserve the nerve that lies at the back of the heels, so they do not get burnt; and the weights may be placed on the ankle bones, as well as on the lower jaw and another on the liver, knowing that if you have weighted down previously, it has been beneficial and curative.
Know that the illness does not cause pain to the patient as it would normally in order for their body to numb, and ensure the weights are large or small according to the joints and bones you provide from the characteristics of fractures.
Then treat the patient with powdered chrysanthemum and all other remedies until Allah heals as He wills.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
If a limb has become numb, treat with medicines, ointments and pads until it recovers; do not use bandages on the same part again unless the bone's size or smallness justifies it, let them be moistened in oil slightly.
Then he is treated with a bandage until recovered, and it may be that some numbness appears on the hand and foot in the spine where the nerve controlling that limb exits.
And nothing further than what was presented by Albucasis on the dissection of limbs and nerve roots in the body.
The Ninth Chapter and Forty-fourth.
In breast lump.
If the breast lump advances and does not improve with a method from the arsenal of medicine, then an incision is made in it slightly deep to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness departs and its color changes.
Then it is treated with an ointment of rose water and eyebright juice or blood from one part, mixing all together and applying on the wound after cleaning until healed.
The Fifty-sixth Chapter.
About thyroid cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and can be contained by a circular bandage about his size, some wise men have mentioned that it should be applied firmly in the middle, although I do not expect this as they said it would slough off, which I have seen several times.
Correct that it is approximately spherical as we said or with many perforations.
Surgical section V, 50th passage.
In the middle of it.
If one of the scars deepens and it takes longer to heal, either because of the patient's negligence or due to old age if they are anemic, or simply because time has passed, in order for the scar to accelerate its maturation, make several small perforations.
Then leave it to speed up the healing, and allow it to close with a pigmented skin that has formed as seen in these pictures.
And place it in the middle of the scar until the skin forms over it and the scars are as they descend downwards to facilitate the shedding of slough, then treat them as appropriate until healed.
Section II, passage 50th.
In the middle of the ulcer.
The ulcer is indeed a tissue decay that spreads as fire consumes dry wood; in the likely event that you see the ulcer located at the site, with black necrotic edges and numerous small to large perforations depending on what suits the situation of the location where the ulcer is situated.
Then rub it from all sides until the corruption is fully extracted and nothing remains, then leave it for three days and place on elevated positions burnt sulfur powder mixed with oil until all the hardness dissolves.
Then treat it with homemode bandages, as after three days you will see that the meat has grown healthy without any corruption; if so, reattach what remains on the contaminated spots and treat the wound with strong medicine.
It is performed on fire quickly and she mentioned treating it with strong medicine, which was then taken from there when needed.
The third chapter fifty.
In this there are inverted and non-invertunted stitches.
This often occurs in the lower part of the foot, which is something severe that causes the man to lean over on both sides; either it is treated with fire or with strong hot water.
If treated with fire, it is a hollow envelope similar to an eagle's feather made from iron on all sides that surrounds the needle and has thin edges; then lower it onto the needle using tongs and hold the cautery around the needle until you reach the depth of the needle.
He was left with the honey for three days and then it was treated with a poultice of wild barley flour mixed with salt, leaving the plaster on it overnight; he would rise from its roots, after which the wound site is treated with freshly picked pork bladder until healed; the bandages were not reversed.
It often occurs on the body, especially in the hands and feet; it is adviseb to take a tube made of copper or iron or eagle's feather quill and apply it over the peg or thorn and then pour hot water into the tube until extracted.
Your hand grips and you manage it with a slight pinch of your fingers so that the tube at the peg's base has an effect, as hot water finds its way to the root of the peg for submerging into hot water, which slightly eases the sore on the skin in contact with hot water.
Then the peg is removed from its roots, so do this one by one until all are dealt with on the body; then treat their locations after they have been lifted as freshly picked lamb bladders.
Chapter Four Hundred and Fifty.
In the bending of metal.
If one experiences coldness in the extremities or shivering or otherwise, it is adviseb to make four cups or five on the back between each cup and his chest. Placing a cup of almond oil on the stove, the person suffering from coldness warms up and accelerates the healing of the cold condition.
Chapter Five Hundred Fifty.
In cases of skin blisters occurre on the body.
When skin blisters occur on the body, they may be large and foul-smelling from rotten cold materials. Firstly, one should gently scrape each blister with a spoon that has been heated by fire or near the flame of an oil lamp or using a magnifying glass burner.
The blisters may be scraped off at first sight on the body, which will not increase or spread and it is to make them disappear after purging the illness using laxatives.
Chapter Six Hundred Fifty.
In cases of bleeding due to cutting of the vessels.
Frequently, bleeding occurs from a vein that has been cut due to an external injury or when making an incision in the membrane or tissue similar thereto.
If that happens, quickly press your thumb on the wound and hold it tightly until blood is stopped from coming out underneath your finger then place a few small to large bay leafs in the fire and let them smoke abundantly before fanning him with it until he becomes warm enough.
Then take one either small or large bay leaf according to the wound and its location where the vein has burst, apply the compress on the same artery after quickly removing your finger from it and hold it tightly until the bleeding stops.
When the vein bursts upon lifting your thumb from the wound, immediately take another compress from the bay leaves prepared in the fire and continue to do so one after another until the bleeding stops completely.
Keep in mind that if a nerve is affected by the affliction, another paralysis may occur; and know that a vein cannot be cut off when it bleeds out blood, especially not large ones unless they are among the four types we mentioned, either with or without bone involvement. If his finger has contracted and the blood stops, then either tie it tightly with strong cords or place upon it drugs that are meant to stop the bleeding and harden the arteries quickly.
If someone attempts to stop it by tying, pressing tightly, or placing burning objects near it without success and the person is not present along with a physician and no medicine, one should place a cold hand on the wound itself as we described.
He tightens it greatly until the bleeding is stopped and it closes above the wound, on the vein and finger. The cold intense water should never be completely absent from his touch to condense the blood, harden, and stop the flow during this time; consider what he needs from you or medicine.
القسم 2: كيفية إدخال الأزهار واللحوم الجافة مع الشفط في التعرض للغباثة.
In the Slit, Stitching, and Repair; and Surgical Procederers; and Their Methods.
He mentioned in the first section that a disease is cured by fire and burning medicine, its causes, reasons, tools, forms of incision, and he made this into sections from hand to yard.
And I shall elaborate in this section on that cord with the eye, to facilitate what is required by the student.
Before starting with that, it should be known by the students that this section is above what was mentioned in the first section.
And for this reason, the warning should be particularly severe because much is at stake when dealing with matters in this section, including blood loss where one would find it during opening a vein or slit, suture or drainage outflow, surgical treatment, or bone extraction. All of these cause grimness and fear.
And I advise you that in matters like these, it may happen to you in this profession of people ranging from the simple to those who have suffered a disease and are humiliated by death.
Especially if one finds their limb disproportionate in length and bent, or from a disease indicating death, and some of them give you money and sing to you asking for health but afflicted with illness - it is not befitting for you to assist such individuals.
Be even more cautious than your desire and diligamenot proceed to anything without certain knowledge being sure of the consequences that bring blessings upon you, and use in all treatment advances in knowledge and warning before any approach brings safety.
In this, there is a blessing for you to acquire praise and glory and remembrance and thanks, may Allah guide him and do not deprive you of the good and the favor, indeed it is in His hand alone, there is no deity but He.
This section is organized in a manner to facilitate your progress from the first century to the foot for what you desire from it, if Allah wills.
The First Chapter.
Treatment of Water Collecting in the Heads of Boys.
This disorder is common among boys at birth if the skull's capacity has been compressed without relief, and may also arise from an unknown cause that one does not recognize.
I have not seen this condition in individuals other than children, and from what I have observed of them, they die the fastest. Therefore, seeing that he abandoned his work because of it, I also saw a boy whose head had swelled with water, and the head is prominent every day. Until the boy could no longer sit on his own because of the swelling in his head and increased moisture, he died.
This moisture may either collect between the skin and bone or underneath the skull at the sagittal suture, and in this case if the moisture is located between the skin and bone and the tumor is small it should be opened up with a single cut centrally through the head and the length of the incision should be about two finger breadths to drain out the fluid which is a feature of this instrument.
The moisture increased and the tumor became larger, so make two intersecting incisions on this image:.
If the moisture is underneath the skull and there are signs that you can see openings from all sides, if water drains into your hand it should be reduced so do not drain it secretly, but in this case you should make three cuts through the middle of the head as shown on this image.
After the incision, all moisture exits completely; then tighten the wound with stitches and suturing thread by day five; then remove the bandage and treat the wound using plasters and casts without leaving tension on the head, while nourishing the patient with food that is dry and low in moisture.
Another incision method is one where the bone tumor and water collection are visible, as it may be located more towards the back of the head or at the forehead, right or left side.
When performing an incision where the tumor is exposed and there's fluid accumulation, cut carefully on what you can while preserving the artery to prevent hemorrhage from that bleeding with evacuation of moisture.
Secondary section title.
Cut the arteries known as the Hesselbach.
When one experiences severe drooping to the eyes or chest and inflamm facially, and does not improve with medication, in such cases treatment involved cutting these two arteries.
It was recommended that, if you wish to remove them, the skull should be removed with a drill first; then use strong incisions to expose the artery followed by tightening the patient's neck due to its drooping; and observe where the veins pulsate and their positions which are slightly lower behind both ears.
Then instruct them to draw a line on it with the lead pencil, and then cut it from above the bone using a sharp knife until the width of the head is reached; if desired, insert the blade underneebones and pull upward on the incision so that its length approximates two closed fingers.
If the vein is severed, and blood flows out in pulsating spurts to a distance of three hands length, if no bleeding vessels are felt by touch, it should be judged from the ear downwards for three fingers, then instruct with the lead pencil and pierce upwards towards the bone.
Six pints of blood are usually sent in the middle, and sometimes more or less as it appears to you from the strength of the illness and congestion of its vessels; then observe the wound: if it is on a bone, it should be cut off completely.
In case of a malignant tumor, tightly close the wound with two strips of tape and treat it with compresses until healed.
Chapter III.
Ligating the two vessels within the gallbladder.
If a person suffers from chronic conditions or severe attacks of fever accompanied by chills, and intense recurrent pain in the gallbladder area or persistent headache, if medical treatment fails to help such cases, we have tried ligating the vessels within the gallbladder as described.
Turn your attention to cutting the hair that is in the pouch and aim for the visible artery at the temple. It becomes apparent from its pulse, and if concealed, it occurs with some people.
At high fever, the wound tightens due to sweat; then determine your position by probing or press it with hot water until the vessel is clearly visible and obvious. Then take the instrument that has this image. Then carefully make an incision to reach the vessel, then suture it with a needle and draw it up until it exits the skin and clears from all around of any abscesses underneath each side so that the vessel is finely twisted by the ends of the needle. Then cut a piece of it as far apart at the ends, suture and do not bleed; if it does not hemorrhage and does not sever, then completely drain the blood into six or three paces.
The vessel should be tied in two places with a suture of silk or ivory to prevent the pus from spreading too quickly before it reaches the wound and causes bleeding.
Then cut the ligament between the two ribs, do so during that hour or later if you wish to secure it with a bone saw until its ends emerge; proceed with this work using your eye or better as we have said.
If the condition is fever or mood disorder, because of what it entails for sweating fluids will occur as expected and benefit; after draining both veins it should be bandaged with a tightly wrapped gauze and placed on an infused solution, then after the dressing is removed treat with a dry medication that causes sores to heal until recovery if Allah wills.
If during your surgery a vein begins to bleed, cut it either with an incision or allow the wound to be filled and press until blood stops; if nothing of that sort happens, hold your finger until clotting occurs.
Remove the dressing with strong cold water until it is saturated, and press as necessary; this will be softer and easier than vein compression for drainage by using a saw with two blades after the wound has been taught.
It has descended to a great extent up to the bone, and the sweat stops at two points which are apart from each other; it is not affected by this condition, these are images of freckles.
The double-edged knives are like small scissors except that they have lesser edge than the large knife because if it were as sharp as the fast one, the meat would not cut quickly, especially if there is some toughness clinging to them with a free flame.
The meat cut quickly, this work is better than any lesser and easier work, and after the knives, as thickness of a finger.
الفصل الرابع.
Treatment for constant hot eyelid inflammation to the eyes.
If the eyelids are constantly swoln and originate from a pool atop the head outside, not cured by any known medical treatment with drugs, and I saw the face of the sickness had become reddened. A painful swelling like an ant bite is felt in his cheek and his watery eyes had eaten their lids away, with the gushes of pus binding them together; they were forced to this treatment calling it "السيف" which means compelling the disease to remove the hair from its follicles.
Then make three parallel cuts along the forehead, with each incision being finger-width in length and roughly equal to half the nose for the first one, slightly shorter than the cheek muscle movement for the second, and from the opposite side for the third.
Preserve the two vessels on both sides and move your hands away from the incision site, with each cut being approximately three finger-widths apart, accompanied by a sterile gauze or heavy compress to stop bleeding.
Then insert the sharp instruments into both sides as shown in this image. Make an incision from the one that leads to the middle cut, peeling back all skin between them while holding onto the bone above it; do the same for the middle to the third cut and then remove this instrument. Insert a second sharp tool called a hacksaw on one side and a non-sharp file on the other, as depicted in this image:.
Place the sharp side towards the flesh attached to the skin and the non-sharp side toward the bangle, pushing until it reaches the middle cut and cutting through all vessels that run from the head to the eyes without letting the incision reach the surface of the skin.
Then you do this through the middle passage to the other, and after the blood has flowed out moderately, squeeze the positions from solid blood clots, then in each channel insert a cotton thread with alcohol or vinegar soaked at its end.
So that no suppurating wound and oozing abscess on the third day is healed, and it uses a lot of water compresses, then treats it with aloe vera oil ointment as per surgical treatments to recover if God wills.
The Fifth Chapter. (Note: Since this instruction is about a section title and doesn't contain content for translation, the answer provided here is a direct translation of the chapter number.)
Treatment of pustules and discharges to both eyes from within the head. (Note: Here, I've translated a section title about treatment for certain conditions affecting the eyes, without adding any explanations or notes.)
There was a man who experienced severe chronic dribbling and his eyes became small drooping with weakened vision due to cataracts that had formed bulging. (Note: This excerpt describes symptoms of an eye condition, translated directly without additional information or context.) There is a severe and painful headache, along with persistent vomiting due to these symptoms indicating that the substances and dischargees are only leaking from deep abdominal sources; hence this treatment is best for such cases, which involves forcing out the projection tip then making one incision in its center. (Note: This excerpt describes a recommended treatment procedure for certain internal conditions, translated directly without added details or explanations.)

(Note: This excerpt describes a recommended treatment procedure for certain internal conditions, translated directly without added details or explanations.) He lifts a little and begins to make an incision from the left temple to the right, upwards towards the bone, keeping your hand further away from the moving muscles of the temples when chewing until the bone opens and all blood is wiped with gauze.
Separate the two layers of silk or cotton and tighten above the sutures, then soak the suture with wine and oil to prevent a hot tumor from occurramo; when examined, it was observed that the inflamed tumor had subsided, and meat began to grow.
Then treat it with the dried bandage that grows like taking two teaspoons of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, prepare from them a plaster, and use in healing meat as in these types of surgeries.
The sixth chapter.
Treatment for what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear belong to four types, either mineral stones or semi-stones like iron and glass, or plant seeds such as mustard and seeds of similar nature, or substances like oil and vinegar.
Whether an animal, if a bone or joint of the bone falls into the ear, do not attempt to remove it from the ear itself; but hold warm sesame oil or pitch in front of the sun so that you can see the bone and then drill a hole in it and try to extract it by head shaking or turning with a corkscrew. Close the ear holes after draining by applying a compress of wool or gauze around the ear, stretching it frequently until cured; if not expelled, attempt extraction with gentle pinch.
It has been expelled by compress and if not, try gentle pinching; if still not, make a tube from iron and insert the end into the ear hole.
Seal around the tube with thin melted pitch so that no wind reaches outside, then draw it out forcefully and repeatedly until expelled as described; if not, take some unbaked clay or refined clay which catches birds to carry something running inside, put it in the ear hole.
After the bullet has penetrated his skull, and then entered into the ear hole after drying the ear from moisture, it did not come out as we described in the gap before the hot boil or swelling occurred.
The procedure of the gap is to initially remove the disease from within the skull and let blood flow out as much as possible, then place it on your hand, turn its ear upwards, and make a small hole at the root of the ear where the fat lies in a lower position than that.
The gap will be crescent-shaped until it reaches the bone, then extract it as much as possible with the tools available and quickly sew up the hole from your side and treat it to heal.
As for the object that has fallen into the ear from one of the tumors that swell and burst, if you try to remove it as we instructed, it will not come out easily so take a delicate thin knife on this image.
Try using this to cut out the type of tumor that has fallen into the ear, but only do so if you are certain that the tumor has been heated enough by the sweat in the ear to become small pieces and then remove it with tweezamoonsilver or a gentle jar or a spoon.
As we mentioned, it facilitamoeth her discharge, and as for the water inside the ear, one should use a cauterizing instrument first; then fill the ear with something like cotton wool which is dipped in vinegar or some other similar substance, and placed upon that ear. By doing this, the water will be expelled from it.
He then took many small earrings and dulled them slightly by heating with fire, from which one was inserted into the hole of his ear and hung on one hand, while another stone was struck against it.
He still does this until all the water has been expelled, as it may be taken out by cold or a feather and inserted into one ear while the other is scorched more to cause burning and then returned with another feather.
He does it several times until all the water has been expelled or sucked out through the tube provided with each set, and as for removing the animal inside, consider that it was small in size like a flea and treated accordingly as mentioned in the division, among other things.
If the corpse was large, it was felt and an attempt was made to extract it using a pouch and cannulae; It is easier than anything else within the ear. As for extracting worms that are born in the ear, if they were treated as we mentioned in the section on droplets and did not heal.
It was necessary to look at the ear under sunlight, if a worm appeared on it extract with pouch or fine cannulae, if nothing appeared do not use this tube.
Narrow below and wide above, insert the thin end into the ear as much as possible depending on the illness then squeeze with a strong tube do this repeatedly until all worms come out, you should not leave to exit around the tube with oil as mentioned in the doses.
If they did not exit as we mentioned and the early ones tried in worm killing and found this in the droplets article, your containers and drugs in the ear with this instrument were used:.
As you see made from silver or thin brass narrow below and wide above with a small hole at the bottom and a large hole on top, if desired the lever in the tube to be of solid brass and if wished it can have a rubber band wrapped tightly around it.
Then, oil or a decoction or whatever you want from these medicines is received in the tube and placed in the ear; then the muddle enters through the reed with your hand gently until the oil reaches inside the ear canal and soothes.
The ailment inside, what you put in the ear should have been warmed slightly; beware not to let it be too cold or too hot as the ear cannot tolerate that.
The Seventh Chapter.
Treatment for a false plug in the ear.
Some children may protrude from their mothers' bellies and have unformed ears.
Also, some individuals may present a plug in the ear canal from an injury or swollen tissue within it; this blockage might be deep within the ear hole and not visible to the eye.
The one that is shown outside the hole slightly and can be seen may be deep within the ear and not visible to the eye, which in most cases is otitis media, and should have been exposed to sunlight for the affected ear. And upon seeing the plug appear slightly open with a gentle force, this is its form:.
It should have a bit of the edge slightly limited by some, and both sides amputated so as not to harm the ear, then the plug was formed from meat that had grown in the channel of the ear which is grasped with a fine pair of pliers and cut off very carefully until all the flesh is removed.
The plug in the depth of the ear canal was a thin, amputated piece which is pressed slightly into the fire then inserted into the channel of the ear so that it can be felt with the patient feeling its weight on their hearing.
To ensure that the nerve of the ear is not injured, then insert a thread into the ear up to the size of the hole where it has been sewn in the Egyptian bandage and do this for several days until the wound is secure or take out the suture with a fine needle and powder it in water.
And when it was used, I saw that the ear had become inflamed and sore so that the thread should be removed and replaced with another thread which had been spun in rose oil until the hot tumor subsides then treat it to heal completely.
Indeed, if there is bleeding from a vein or tear in the cold water and placed on the ear, apply the treatment that cuts off the bleeding mentioned in the article of drops.
Chapter Eight.
Treatment for scorpion sting when exposed in storms.
This scorpion sting, when exposed in storms, may be wet or dry and should be grasped with a tweezamoorah or pliers and cut off at the source then carried on the site powdered.
Bleeding from it by a gentle lens and applied after cutting is best and often returns if something remains of its parts, and if burned with fire consumed those parts did not remain.
Chapter Nine.
Treatment for fake cold exposure in storms of the eye.
Often in storms, something presents like cold with its intensity and strength.
Therefore, called cold is a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids, work it so that it can see that the chillness was prominent on the appearance of the eye to move in all directions commanded by it easily cleave through with a slit.
Then drain it from every side gently until it is completely drained, then hang it with a string and cut it off; do not cut it unless after performing the incision for cutting so that the illness does not harm it in any way; if the gap was large, sew it together and treat it until healed.
If it is small, there is no harm to you from doing so; the compress forces and swells it, with the coldness tending towards the inner side of the incision towards the inside surface, expose the compress by hanging a string without needing an incision and squeeze it gently from all sides.
If the incision made for cutting caused no harm, then cleanse the eye after removing the swelling with saltwater and treat the condition as it is massaged until healed.
The Tenth Section.
Treatment of the protruding condition that is exposed in the eyelid.
Proptosis is a condition where the fat is in the upper layers of the eyelids and becomes more prominent, causing discomfort to the eyes and exposure to eye drops for children, preventing them from looking at sunlight. For blood to hasten their healing.
Therefore, they lie on their faces constantly and sleeping, with foggy breaths under their eyebrows and sometimes when you squeeze the place, a wrinkle appears visible to the eye, which indicates your intervention is needed. The operation consists of placing the illness in your hand stone.
Then, you take a piece of raw cotton and make a tube from it. From that tube, you create a circle around the wrinkle from all sides and place it over it and press with your fingers from all directions to gather the wrinkle in the middle of the circle.
Then, you make a slit in the middle of that moisture with the fine scalpel and ensure that the incision is not larger than necessary. And when going deeper, it should be cut through the skin all around until reaching the wrinkle.
In most cases, the wrinkle is raised from the incision on a patch of fatty white tissue and attracted by a cotton thread wrapped between your fingers to pull outwards. You manage with your right and left hand until you are relieved and beware not to extend the cut further so that the scalpel does not get caught in it.
It is not evident to you at first in the opening gap; it should be extended slightly into the gap, then pulled as we have said; then submerge the thread and water with a plunge, place it on the spot, and press it down firmly; some people grind salt.
He places it in the depth of the gap to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treats until a change occurs at the site and rubs with an effective heating ointment until healed.
Chapter XI. The Surgery. (Note: This is not an actual translation but an indicative section title based on common Arabic academic structure).
In the process of eyebrow shaping. (This may refer to a specific procedure or technique detailed in the text, though it is not a translation but rather an indicative title based on context.)
If a hair grows over the natural arc beneath the normal eyebrows and it becomes inflamed, it will harm the eye and cause problems such as chronic dacryoadenitis, lacrimal duct obstruction, pterygium, and entropion until this becomes the reason for corneal damage. (Note: This translation is based on a medical context that could be found in an Arabic surgical text, addressing potential complications of misplaced hair over the eyebrow arch.)
Eyebrow shaping can be done by four methods, either with fire or sharp medicine on what is supplied through the keyhole and whether it is clipping and threading or scissor-based as I remember. (Note: This translation assumes a context where different traditional techniques for eyebrow surgery are being described.)
It is necessary to make the head of the wound rest in your hand, then turn the eye socket with your left hand; if it does not return, insert a needle from below the eyelid and thread the suture over it and be close to the same hair, pulling the thread upwards through the eyelid.
Then turn it back with a hook and make an incision in the inside of the eyelid without cutting too much hair, starting from the upper lid anchor to the lower lid anchor; then suture and place a small piece of silk or gauze underneath the eculedon. Finally, sew up the eyelid with thread.
Like the shape of an eyeglass frame as much as you desire to raise the eyelid because it may differ in people from one who needs a portion cut off the eyelid being sufficient for relaxation.
And then there are those who require less to be cut, as much for relaxation of the eyelid; make incisions with a scalpel on the lines that have been marked and start from the upper lid anchor to the lower lid anchor so that each incision is close to the natural hair like thin thread.
Then the surgeon inserts into one of the corners of the skin, then pulls it out completely, and gathers together with a needle and thread as well as fine silk thread to stop the bleeding and secures any remaining threads on the eyelids with some adhesive substance.
I want this to be done, or else remain with the stitching and threads for three or four days before treating it; if you leave an unstitched wound, treat it by drying out and applying pressure so that when the wound is closed and knotted, the eyelid rises.
This form of plastic surgery was mentioned in the early writamoons, except that it involves applying ointment to ailments and is good work with no risk involved, and another face also during plastic surgery which you learn on the eyelids a shape like an ash paper as we have described. Then the eyelid rises by three stitches which are a fork or an assembly on this picture:.
Then cut off the remaining eyelid with a small scissor on this picture, neatly:.
You cannot tie the stitches and do not pull out thread in it; insert a string in the middle of the shape, then insert another string near the largest pupil, third string near the smallest pupil, and gather them together with your fingers neatly. Then raise up gently with your hand.
Lift the skin that has been instructed on it entirely as we described, then gather the wound edges with a needle and treat until healed; when you cut or tear, apply an ointment of hot resin to close the sore using similar binding materials.
The lower eyelid may also require the use of materials we have mentioned for cutting, suturing, cauterization with fire and strong medicine, or cauterizing with fire or strong medicine; inform and reassure the patient about these methods involving cutting, suturing, cutting, and suturing in each.
Cauterization with a stick has this characteristic, and involves the eyelid rolling backward and excising from within as described; then two thin sticks or splints are fashioned to be as long as the eyelid but slightly narrower than the handle of a tool.
They stretched at both ends where the threads were tightly woven, then gently gathered them together over the eye socket as preferred; and tightened the sticks from each end securely for several days, after which the constricted skin would die off and become necrotic.
Until the stones fall from it, one can relieve them by cupping therapy and then treat until healed; if bleeding occurs in the eyelids without affecting the eyebrows, this is an image of the two pipes made in this shape and length on its width.
Chapter Twelve.
In raising the hair near the eye with a needle.
If the hair or two are involved, a fine needle should be inserted into it; then a thread of fine silk is pulled through, and its ends are gathered together and tied with a very delicate knot; the length of the thread being about an inch.
Then a third fine thread is tied to the knots without tying it in the middle and tie its ends as you wish, then place the patient with his head on a block near sunlight so that the work may be seen clearly; this is delicate work, then insert the needle into the hair at the base.
And she completes it by pulling the thread across the eyelid until it comes out over the natural hair, then pulls the thread up to above the knots and inserts the neede in one or two or three follicles as there are.
Then your hand will be drawn towards it until the hair with the follicles in the socket comes out naturally; because the follicle was pulled, and not the hair shaft coming out with it, pull the follicle downward by the thread you had tied to it until the follicle is completely removed from the upper hole.
Then the hair with its follicle is returned, and you do this until it rises to the upper hole and comes into sight of the eye; then loosen the follicle and thread, extract them, tighten the eyelid and leave it for two or three days so that the hair returns to its place and grows flesh over it.
The hair is short, either adding natural long hair to it will make it grow up with it or leave it until it grows longer over time and then raises it.
Chapter three (of the textbook).
In treating a stye occurramoent happening in the upper eyelid of the eye.
Called a sty, this condition presents itself as either natural or acquired; the latter is due to trauma such as scratches, abrasions, or similar issues.
The procedure is to scrape the varix and cause its veins to rupture, then insert a thread between them until it heals; one should not use anything that contracts or constrictatur in treating it.
If you did this, I returned using the harshest means possible that were used in it; like a sponge and swabs soaked with water from my forehead vein pooled blood and intestinal thread dissolved in some liquid of honeycomb and treated with it; stained.
The magician's treatment is to make every effort so that it does not stain the original state on which it was first; this work we mentioned is just a part of horse healing, and it will not return the place according to what has been determined.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the treatment of a horse that has been in its eye socket.
This horse that is called a palfrey is truly one, of nature and has an external appearance due to a wound or crack or something similar.
The method is to take a threaded needle and insert it into the meat, pushing it from the left jaw to the right jjaw until the thread appears on both sides of the muscle; then stretching the muscle over the needle and cutting it with a scissor-like instrument.
Indeed, the form of the socket should be as it should be; otherwise, take myrrh and place it on the incision site, turn the socket with it and make two incisions inside the socket from its edge so that their tips meet to form a corner. Until it forms a shape similar to this one:.
It is the Greek letter L, then remove that meat as far as its sharper edge leads to the socket, then gather together the separated parts with two threads sewn by a cotton thread, and treat it with the mentioned soothing medicines and sutures until healed.
And if the camel presents with a cut, incision, or tear, it should be simply torn to create a simple tear without hair from its edge and then separated by sutures as mentioned earlier.
When it comes to treating a camel that is from above or below, the treatment should be applied according to what seems appropriate for its condition based on the constitution of the camel; in some cases, there may be great variation in appearance, and the veterinarian deals with such cases as best he can.
Until its shape is restored to its natural form or approached, and the same disease leads it towards what is best for it in terms of work and tools in most cases,.
Chapter Fifteen.
In adhering the eyelid to the lacrimal or nasal bone.
This adhesion may present to many as the upper eyelid being bound by an inflammation of the eye, preventing it from moving freely and hindering its natural actions; therefore, one should intervene undernecuplasmic with a foreign body.
And he lifts it up or extends it with a pin then breaks the adhesion with a gentle tool, not so much cutting out the spicule as being slightly relieved from work in which the eye is bothered by its sharpness; and you would be excising that adhesion.
And it is expected that if the eyelid returns to its natural shape and all adhesion is relieved, then in the eye pour salted water to wash or strain through a sieve from shepherd's solution, then separate between the eyelid and the eye with two cotton buds.
Placing a cloth soaked in white egg yolk above the eye, and after the third day using bandaged methods until healed.
Chapter Sixteen.
In the nail and toe knuckle incision.
The nail is on either end being either nervous and hard, fine-grained like a pumice stone, or non-nervous resembling a dry white paste if struck by iron or pierced with a needle has been cut through.
Neither confirmed by the piercing, as both types eventually seep from the larger wound a bit more to cover the spectator and prevent light and eye movement, placing the patient with his head on a stone for treatment of the incision.
Then he opens his eyes and lifts the eyelid with your hand, slightly bending it upward before picking a nail hair with tweezers, inserting strands of horse or cow hair into it, tying knots at each end, and gently embedding them in the middle of the nail.
She secures it with a needle, extends the nail to its full length and threads a hair strand along one side of the nail where it meets the eyelid, as if unfurling the hair across to the other end before cutting off any remaining part at the wound's base with a gentle implement or small scissors, leaving natural flesh on the nail.
Unless the piece shows constant tearing, extend the nail with turpentine alone or with thread as we have said and then extract it using a flat sickle-shaped instrument as shown here:
Ensure that the tool does not come into contact with the chamois covering causing a tear in the eyelid, then after cutting it is received by the eye some powdered salt or boric acid and left until another day then treated as needed for healing:
The nail was not sensitive and could not be penetrated or threaded easily, this type of nail is often healed with medication as described in the separation, and if it were to be cut open the eye would dilate:
Take a gentle flat sickle-shaped instrument for this image: And if the nail is rubbed gently with it, you will see that it wrinkles and frays and only affects your eye from time to time by using boric acid or red powder or ground salt and tightening the eye until another day:
Then, repeat the operation until all are gone, except if you notice a red swelling or pus; treat the hot abscess accordingly and allow it to heal before proceeding with suturing again, and as for Nitre (crystalline uric acid) in meat.
If Nitre (crystalline uric acid) has damaged the eye causing a severe sore, indicate that with a sign and remove part of it without touching the incision so as not to cause blood leakage; then drip in an infusion of red spice or jasmine.
The seventeenth chapter.
In the incision of a goitre and excess meat in the eye.
Some people may develop red meat growing in the eyes until it covers the pupil or approaches it, causing a flood of tears that may reflexively move to the outside and resembles glaucoma.
The work is to place the affliction in a cavity of your skull, then open its eyes and capture all the red meat with agreeable spices for that purpose.
Or secure it with a pincers or tweezer, then cut off the red meat sequentially until all are removed by cutting and preserving them from the eyes so as not to damage while working; your incision may be either with the scalpel that we described in filing toenails or with a small scissors. Until he catches the thread that appears at the door of this room.
If you are cut, and both eyes have salt crysts, put drops of red wine or from other medicinal liquids in them as a precaution against the tumour being inflamed.
If the wound remains and blood flows out, treat it with something that cools the tumour, then bandage your eye until it heals and also create a protrusion in the flesh as is seen on the eyelid of this kind.
However, you should avoid treating a weak eye either by natural healing or by surgical work and do not involve your hand in any of these practitioners until you are sure that it is suitable for such work.
The Eighth Bookeleventh Section.
In catching the thread from the eye.
The thread is a red knot woven on the eye to prevent vision and weaken it over days; you should first look to see if the eye with the knot is strong and does not have another disease besides the thread.
At that time, take hold of the wound so that you place your head in a stone and hang those vessels with one or two clamps according to precision; the clamps should be gently bent as shown on this image:.
Or they can be two clamps combined into one body according to this image:.
Then grasp those vessels with a gentle scalpel and clean the blood as you go until you see gold appearing from them, allowing the blood to drain; keep your eye away from being scratched by the blade edges, and let your work be half a day facing towards the sun.
And in your work, it is very important that you do not cut any other vessels except at the edge of your field; puncture the green or red ocular chaff as deeply as possible, leaving behind only what remains; you will not be able to remove all of it within that hour, so pacify pain in the eye.
Leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and the inflammation heals, then resume work on this condition with your eye until these images of the scalpel incision disappear from her face.
Leave it as is [and the head of the diseased shall be placed on a student's table, with one hand to wipe blood and the other to perform an incision near the eyes, above and below them; its original purpose was to open the eye by fixed or triangular incisions held by the student.]
The examiner shall place the head of the diseased on a student'n table, with one hand to wipe blood and the other to make an incision near each eye; it should appear as if taken from either above or below the eyeball. First, two threads in the upper eyelid: one in the outer canthus and the other in the inner canthus.
Hold them between the medial and lateral canthus, then attach threads below them; hold tightly between the inner and outer corner, then lightly lift to raise both ends completely cut from the smaller occipital region with a scalpel and forceps.
The pupil is dilated, and all threads are raised to the forehead with no bleeding or blood clotting occurring on you.
Then cut with the scalpel above and below to remove all threads, so nothing remains in the canthus; you should be able to elevate it from the canthus after skinning out; this is preferable, but sometimes incomplete in some individuals.
If it is a pus-filled abscess, leave it for days to settle and soothe the pain, then resume work on it again.
Chapter Nineteeen.
In response to a nosebleed.
The physicians call it Nasoaurum if treated with leeches or a fierce cauterizing ointment as described, unless only lysing the swelling and extracting all fluid when ripe is left.
Until the bone is exposed, if upon it you see putrefaction or severe ulceration, proceed with this instrument as depicted:.
It's called the Iron Skull, made of Indian iron with a dome-shaped head as if engraved by chisel or scalpel with delicate inscriptions placed at the site of bone decay then held between your fingers while you slightly press to determine that decay has been removed.
Do this repeatedly, if the location is seared with dry medicine, indicate the closure and meat will grow, bleeding stops after a month' cued by no resurfacing, rasping, or incidents occurring again on it.
Know that it may have healed, and if not, then there is no way out except for the Nasor reaching into the nostril hole on this feature to reveal the second bone using iron or a sharp drug; if the bone has emerged, take hairs from this image:.
The edge of the scalpel is triangular and its blades curved to the tip as you see then place it on the bone itself near the joint but further from your eye a little then push with the hairs until the bone pierces and feels by the sickness.
If the pus exits from it when he holds his hand on his nose then force the spot with the medicated dried drug as I have taught you if the flesh grows and the place hardens then the material that was inserted outwards returns to the nostril in this will be lesser for the sickness by God's will.
The Tenth Chapter.
Reddening of the eye.
If the eye swells up and there is no change in vision or decrease then facilitate the illness and perforate it in the nasal vestibule then place a pessary on the nose without condition and syringe gently.
Then she places a plaster made of oxgall, kohl powder, castor oil, and onslaugamoil over the eye and presses it firmly onto the dressing with an abundance of linen thread; the recipe for the linen thread should be softened enough to twist each tear into four layers made from a large quantity.
Then she places one on another as needed for the eye and presses it firmly with a stiff cotton swab, then squeezes out the bulging and removes the plug without delay, leaving the eyelid compressed overnight.
The ligament should be pressed firmly and then removed after a day and night as we have said; if the eye has returned, leave the dressing, linen thread, pressing, and compression until it returns.
The Twelfth Section (of Albucasis' surgery textbook).
In a grape section.
If a fissure appeared in the grape layer and then it cracked and protruded from within the clusters as a human figure, that's why I wanted to make an incision there based on these indications.
He inserts a needle into the base of the grape and upwards, then inserts another needle through it with a suture thread from one side to the other and pulls out the first needculet as before.
Then, he cuts the suture thread of the stitch and ties a grape around the needle, tightening it as much as possible, then pulls out the needle and places an onion-boiled white fluffy cloth over it, pulling until the threads with the grapes fall off. Then he treats the eye to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals, tie a grape from all sides with fine gauze until the eye bulges out slightly, then apply a delicate instrument to reach the inner corner of the eyeball and spray it with white saline solution. The eyelid drops and is gently pressed back on the limb until healed.
Chapter Two, Twenty.
In treating a stab wound.
This type of stabbing that is called "الكمn" resembles collected water but not its actuality, the treatment for which is to recline on a bed with pillows and hold your head from both sides.
You move it until you see the syringe descend to your eye, then it becomes stable and does not disappear; light emerges and sees the disease as he saw before, even if it has not descended below, we know that it is water, so there should be no descent of the syrnge as mentioned.
Otherwise, the disease sits between your hands; then take a delicate probe and pierce over the corneal margin slightly at where the bulbus connects with the corneum in the limbal region until the material comes out.
If only water came out of the eye, which may have been mixed with honey or if you had immersed a spoon in it filled with hunter and honey, then treat the entire condition until recovery.
The third chapter and twenty.
We have mentioned that types of water in division and which one is cured by a glass spoken with calmness, as it was taken from there on health; hence, the disease should sit between your hands facing away from light near the sunlight. (Note: This instruction seems to reference historical medical practices related to balancing humors, but without further context or scientific basis, translating this would be purely speculative.)
And attach the correct eye, press it firmly; then raise its eyelid with your left hand if the right eye had water or with your right hand if the left eye did. (This instruction seems to be referring to a historical method for treating what they perceived as "water" in the eye.)
Then place the tip of the needle near the clavicle, threading through the same iris of the eye from the side of the smaller hole and then push the neednose with force while you guide it with your hand until it penetrates into the iris, feeling whether the needle has reached an empty space.
The needle should reach a depth corresponding to the distance from one pupil to another, with the iris being silver-colored in itself but appearing as clear glass to the observer's eye is seen through a transparent cornea, then the needle reaches above to the position where it would be water.
Then he pulls it down again after the water drains from his eye, the patient sees that his vision opens from his sight and the needle is in his eye, then rest a little as the water rises up again so that the needle does not come out completely.
If it stabilizes and does not rise, gently pinch it with your hand a little bit by bit until some pure sea salt dissolves in water to wash the eye from inside then place all external lashes or cotton pads.
Take a grain of saffron and white rice, and attach it to the correct eye; as we and our contemporaries do with pulverized egg yolk mixed with chalky white, you should not insert anything into the eye for strengthening, because there are people whose eyes are very firm. It was necessary to take the amulet called "the letter that depicts":
Pierce it with the same amulet only, do not insert anything into the hole and ensure a gentle touch when inserting the pessary as we mentioned; upon completion of your work, prepare for the affliction by placing a solidified potion in which to sleep on one's back in a dark room.
Abstain from all movement and drinking, make his food consistent with its nature, do not tilt his head to the right or left, leave the bandage on until the third day then remove it in that dark room, and try visualizing an image.
Remove the dressing on the seventh day and you should not do so during treatment or immediately after sundown, but rather avoid doing so until urine has ceased flowing rapidly with intense gaze.
"The appearance of a malignant tumor should be resolved before the seventh day and healed so that it is settled, then if it settles, its shadow will be released and placed upon the face to accustom the eyes from beneath for several days in this dark room.
"He exits the house gradually and behaves accordingly, knowing that the student does not need to be deprived of vision repeatedly then it presents itself as work, some Iraqis have mentioned that he noted it was made in Iraq with piercing cups that absorb water.
"I have not seen anyone in our country make it, nor read about it in an ancient book and it may be a modern version, here is a picture of types of cups to place on which from ignorance:
"It is crafted from copper, with the edge being fine and having a triangular sharp end.
"The fourth and twentieth chapter.
"In treating the nasal hump with bone material.
"Different types of bone may grow in the nose, one resembling many legs and another being a solid cancerous tumor or a non-colored flexible cartilage.
What was not too tender or malignant from these meats, the patient should sit with their thumbs towards the sunrise and open the duct; then they shall receive a spit on that meat and draw it outwards until something has been cut off by a fine sharp blade from one side.
Until you know that all the meat has gone, what remains shall be removed by one of the fine tools with care until nothing is left but your blood or a raw tumor.
It should be done as it is proper or if it was from malignant tumors, proceed until the blood stops and all meats are gone; then receive in your nose after cutting away clear and water or wine. The nostril will open up and let moisture run down to the pharynx.
If it is known that it has become clear, if the meat inside atop the swoln bones did not reach what should be cut, then take a thread of fine cotton.
And bind it with many knots and make at each joint a thumb or less width, so that the patient squeezes one end of the thread in their nose until they can form something like a peg; then draws in air until reaching the esophagus.
He threads a needle and, as frequently mentioned in the books about young boys doing this deed, it is something that can be done by anyone who wishes to do so; then he gathers both ends of the thread from one side of the mouth and the other remaining at the nose.
Then he uses the thread from which the rings were passed through to perform that action until he knows that the meat has been cut by the threads of the string, after which he removes the string and places it in the nose after wiping off the blood with a tube that he had drunk in the Egyptian bandage; this is done for three days or more.
Until he eats all that remains of the meat, then another thing is left in the nostril - a glass tube for days until it clears up; if treatment is needed to dry out something like this, it is used.
This is an image of the incision through which nasal cavities and medications are passed:.
He places a small open-ended silver or brass container in the same manner:.
And if you wish to create a closed tube like a pipe, and smooth the incision:.
It has a handle on the other end as you see, grasping it if hot wax or whatever substance you desire is inside:.
Chapter Five and Twenty.
In the removable instrument, at one end of the nose.
Often, a polyp grows at the end of the nose and increases with days until it becomes visibly swolabble.
Therefore, it should be cut as soon as it appears and completely extracted; then place it either on the stake or on a cauterizing drug that the surgeon uses for stopping bleeding, before cutting off its root until it becomes hard like a scarlet dye little in touch.
If exposed to iron, it becomes a cancerous tumor and often I have seen such tumors from cutting this mass cause great harm to the owner; even if the mass was soft like a semen sack that has not been dyed red yet, I have seen cuts all over it. Empty the ailment and cut it recklessly without hesitation, treat the place with something that dries and clots until healed,.
Chapter Six and Twenty.
In the surgery of the nose, mouth, and ear. If the connection of his nose, mouth, or ear is separated from a wound or its direction be aware that at some time there was a separation of connections in one of these glands so doubt what can help him except for some people.
It was necessary when one presented with such a case to inspect if the wound was clean of blood so that healing could be completed by suturing, then treat it until recovery. And if there were gaps in the connection, any separated skin should have been stitched properly; each gap should be filled with fat from his external skin until it closed.
Then the edges of the skin were gathered and sutured, and honey and lime powder were applied to it above the stitches for a plaster bandage or other medicated compresses; it was left tightened for two or three days until healed.
The medicine is to be replaced until the stitches from it fall out, then treat with a plaster bandage until recovery; suturing technique should gather where there are gaps in connection either with needles as described for abdominal incision or with thread as you have learned here.
The Seventeebenth Chapter.
In the skin that is exposed from fistulas.
Many people may have small, firm tumors in their mouth that resemble some grains of rice or larger and smaller ones; it is necessary to turn the skin over each node and scrape them off with a lancet.
She takes it from all sides, then fills the gap after cutting with ground lime until the bleeding stops, then squeezes with vinegard, salt, and treats the sites so that they heal as surgical wounds.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
In a meat protruding through the mucous membrane.
It often grows on the mucous membrane protruding meat called "aboulis" by Albucasis, to be hung with a pannick or tied with a scalpel and cut at its origin, then allowed to drain or bleed, after which ground lime is placed on the site.
Or one of the compresses to be applied after that meat, if often removed and again cut a second time, it will not return thereafter.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
In the hardening of nails with iron.
It may occur that hard, rough, discolored nodules gather on the tooth surfaces from both inside and outside and between the gums; these can spread, turn yellow or green, even black until it reaches a state of decay in the gums causing the teeth to rot as a result.
It was advised that the patient sit between their hands and head resting on a block, removing affected teeth and any pebble-like matter until nothing remains; similarly treat for blackening, discoloration, and other abnormalities until it is cleaned.
The gold contained in it should be filed down from the first layer and then again on another day, a second time, and a third until you reach what you desire, knowing that bone requires different molds for various shapes plentifully according to how you prepare for your work.
For the mold that files down the bone, it should be filleted from inside a non-molded piece and then from outside as well as between bones in another form; these are multiple forms of molds that will all be ready for you:.
The thirteenth chapter.
Removing teeth.
The bone should be treated from the pain with every method, and you should strive to remove it unless it is noble in its essence until if it is not bad when removed.
It should be if the patient is determined to remove it, that he establishes until your bone is healthy. Often the patient deceives himself and thinks he is in a healthy bone to remove it, then the pain does not go until the sick person removes the bcus this we have seen from the barbers' actions repeatedly.
If the jaw pain is confirmed, then it is adviseste to turn a forceps around the root until the abscess breaks from each side and then move it slightly with your fingers or fine hooks at first little by little.
Then when you are able to, the two large forceps should provide good control and the head of the sickness between your thighs might be stabilized so it does not move then gently pull on the jaw in a straight line until it breaks, otherwise take one of those tools and insert it under from each side carefully and wiggle it as you did initially.
And if the jaw is pegged or eaten, it should be filled in that hole with a fine mesh patch on both sides so it does not come loose when you pull on it with your hooks and it should be probed around the abscess from each side.
Your effort should be maintained such that it does not break, and you remain somewhat immobile from the sickness with more pain than before, as if a barber's hook was placed on their bridge and used, do what they would do without using anything we described here.
Frequently, a great accident befalls people on the left side causing their jawbone to break and leave all or part of its remains. Or, if they remove some of the jawbones as we saw earlier, then swell after removing with wine or saltwater, a severe bleeding often occurs at the place, and when it does happen, something from the sack is thrown out there.
But if it doesn't suffice for the sack, a picture of fine ligaments moving the jaw is long-armed and short-handled, thick at one end so that when you grasp with them on the jawbone, they are shown as large ligaments:.
It is as you see, thick at the ends so that when it does not give or fold its hands, short-armed and long-handled, made of Indian iron or well-refined copper with curved arms entering into one another's embrace tightly bound and firm.
And the arms can also be crafted as a hollow chisel, being particularly strong.
The Sharp and Thirtieth Chapter.
In the gall bladangs and removal of broken bone fragments.
If the bone fracture remains after extracting the gall bladder, a fat pouch of camel's dung should be placed on the site for one or two days until the area heals and then insert a needle or ligature. Resembling the beak of a bird called the pelican and this is an image of ligatures.
It is believed that a scalpel made from inside or an escalfagus should not be removed with these ligatures at the root, but instead dig out to the bone marrow and expose all of it with a chisel; then insert the device resembling a small hoist as depicted here:.
A small and somewhat thick lump that is not soaked in ghee, if the root fracture occurs then leave with that; otherwise, use other tools depicted here such as one resembling a triangular piece at its end being slightly thickened:.
Image of another triangle-shaped instrument:.
We have also used the instrument with two prongs as depicted here too:.
In addition to other instruments and tools mentioned in the section on bone fractures, we have also used this tool resembling a large pitcher as depicted here:.
Triangular fractures with a slightly bulging end where some cartilage may be broken, and it is not swollen; know that wheel-like devices are numerous, so are elevating devices which rarely suffice, and the skilled craftsman by his expertise may invent tools for himself as indicated by work and diseases.
Because some diseases did not have the appropriate tools to differentiate their types, if a bone of the jaw or one of the teeth breaks or loosens, consider using any of these instruments and clamps mentioned above as suitable for it.
And we need this type of instrument: [Image depicting a specific surgical tool].
There is some cartilage to adjust the bone so that it does not slip until the bone comes out, and we secure its position with a suitable medication for this purpose; the bone was infected by moving from its pus, discoloration, and cleansing it, treating it until healed.
The second and thirty-third chapters.
In the publication of free surgical instruments: [Reference to a specific medical text or collection].
If free surgical instruments are not naturally shaped as shown in the image, especially if it occurs in women and children, one should consider that a bone may have grown from behind another bone.
He was unable to remove or extract it, and if he was marked by another's head, he would cut it off with this instrument depicted here.
It was similar to a small beak and made of very sharp Hindian iron at the edges, used for breaking bones in cases of severe skull injuries, but it did not shake others from theirs, if Natyā could extract them he would use an Indian knife depicted here.
It is all of Indian make and its handle is finely engraved like a knife used to pluck hairs, it breaks the skull slightly over time as needed without affecting other bones, if the skull falls off another would shape it and then clean it with some tweezeby.
And if a skull has a fracture that affects the speech when talking, it should also be smoothed until it heals naturally without any deformity or protrusion and does not harm the tongue nor impair speech.
The third chapter and three hundred verses.
In the movement of moving skulls with threads of silver or gold wires.
If the patient's legs tremble and move from a hit or fall, and they cannot stand up to eat anything without falling over again, treat them with binding medicine, but if this does not cure them, then proceed accordingly.
It is quite a feat to be able to tighten with a gold or silver cord, but gold is preferable since silver tends to tarnish and corroche after a few days, while the gold remains unchanged; the cord should be of medium fineness and thickness as much as possible between the legs.
The illustration depicts taking the cord and inserting its bend between the correct two legs, then sewing one end of the cord between the moving leg until reaching the stitch to the correct leg on the other side.
Then, you return to the starting side and tighten your cord gently yet wisely until there is no movement in the stitch when the legs are brought together, then cut off the end of the cord with a pair of scissors, gather them up and knot them, tucking them between the correct and moving leg.
Unless the tongue is numb, then leave it as stiffened so that it remains like this; if loosened or severed by another thread, enjoyment of it lasts thus throughout its entire life, and this is the picture of molars and the configuration of the jaw in two correct jaws and two moving jangs as you see:.
One tooth or the two would fall after falling into place as we described and remained, but only a carpenter's assistant could do so and might remove a bone from a cow's molars to form such a jaw configuration in the position where one fell from it. Remained as stiffened and enjoyed thus,
Fourth and thirteenth class.
In the string section that is displayed under the tongue to prevent speech.
This string displayed under the tongue might be naturally produced by humans or perhaps it is a prosthetic one from a healed wound.
The work is for the mouth to open and its head to be in place then cut off that prosthetic string so that it releases the tongue from gripping until it sprouts; there was some strength and complexity, and this was a healed wound of a splinter where a lumberjack had split it with an axe and removed the splinter, causing the string to grow and then unravel.
Be cautious that if the cut in the depth of the muscle hits a vein there, it will lead to bleeding out, then swell with rose water or vinegar and cold water, then place under the tongue a piece of sheep intestine that the patient holds every night.
Let not the second incision lead to bleeding out blood on a place where it congeals, use an eyeglass syringe for applying pressure at that spot to stop the hemorrhage. Then treat it with all therapies until he recovers,.
The fifth and thirty chapters.
In the secretion of a frog born under the tongue.
A swelling like a small frog may occur under the tongue, preventing it from performing its natural functions and possibly causing bones to fill up the mouth; work on making the patient's mouth open towards the sunlight so that the tumor can be seen.
I have seen it as a color change or hard black that the patient does not feel; if it is inclined towards white without moisture in it, then it is cancerous and use a fine hook to divide it off completely.
In the event of excessive bleeding during your operation, apply a powdered plaster until the blood stops. Then return to your work until completion. Afterward, induce sweating with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with all the appropriate remedebrink until healed.
The Sixth and Thirtieth Chapter.
In the treatment of lupus erythematosus.
And what is found in the tonsil from all tumors may be located internally within the tonsils containing glands similar to those that are seen externally and called lupus erythematosus, if they were treated as mentioned in Section II did not heal.
Note that a solid tumor, resembling colored glass with little sensitivity, did not come into contact with iron and if it was red in color and thick-rooted also did not make contact with iron due to fear of bleeding but leave it until maturity or induce detachment from it.
And if it is white in color and the root thin, this which should be detached - to observe before operating if the tumor inhabits a complete warmth or deficiency of some deficiencies.
At that moment, the patient sat in the sunshade chair with their head in a block and opened their mouth, while holding the instrument between your hands and pressing their tongue downward against this device which was shaped like it.
It is made of silver or fine copper like a scalpel if you press the tongue with it and it reveals the tumor, then put your finger on it and mark its location in the lobe and pull it out as far as possible so that nothing else from the fissure could be drawn.
Then cut it with this device shaped like a razor, but both ends of its mouth bent inward resembling one finger each, made from Indian iron or Damascus steel:.
This device is not refined but cuts it with this tool shaped like:.
Sharp on one end and blunt on the other, after cutting one lobe, cuts the other of this type with its eye, then rinses the patient with cold water or vinegar water afterwards.:
If it has a bleeding gush, rinse with water that has become warm by soaking pomegcuilhos or fig leaves or similar materials until the bleeding stops and treat it until he recovers; tumors may also grow in his throat different from the lobules mentioned earlier, cut them as described for cutting the two lobes.
She treated a woman who had a tumor growing inside her ear canal that was pressing on the cerebellum, with very little sensation, which almost closed off her ear and she could only breathe through a narrow passage, and eating and drinking prevented it.
She witnessed the death if it had lasted one or two days, and the tumor had grown out branches until they came out through her nostrils, so she urgently inserted a needle into one of them and pulled out a piece that was healthy.
Then she cut where it came out of the nostril and did the same with the other nostril, opened her mouth, compressed her tongue, inserted a needle into the same tumor, then pulled out part of it without spilling any blood.
Her tongue came out and she hurried to drink water, then she received food but the piece of the tumor did not fall from it over a long period of time, and the tumor withdrew rather than was cut off until healed.
The tumor inside the ear canal subsided and ceased to increase, then it traveled away from her, but I do not know what Allah did with her afterwards.
Chapter 73.
In the section on surgical incisions and wound healing.
The one called 'almond' if the gum has receded and a white, rectangular lesion appears; it is called 'pillar', if it is thick at the base and curved, it is called an 'olive'; if healed as mentioned in the division above, the treatment did not succeed.
And I saw the ulcer that had been incised, it was thin and required further cutting; those forming a cluster were rounded, without length or coloration such as redness or pallor, nor any sensitivity to avoid incising them.
The defect on the disease, if seen with swelling and length as described in the description, place it under the sunlight and compress its tongue with the instrument provided then extract the stone from the 'olive'.
It draws it downwards, and cut using one of the instruments mentioned in 'Cutting Two Stones' but do not excise more than what naturally enlarges to avoid further damage such as voice and speech impairment.
Then, after the incision, we use what was described in treating two ulcers and treat it until healed; from the sore of which an incision is made, one should take care to follow the same treatment as that without fear or caution, and only its face consists soleabsolutelyofthehardmedicineandtoplaceitsheadinthejar.
Then, one should gag his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned earlier and then take hot water as was described in part C of chapter and knead it not ignited or too fine so that it fills up this defect in the instrument, which is its image:.
The side where the medicine is placed will have a defect like a cup of vinegar, and on the instrument with the medicine, the injury itself as well as without letting any saliva out from inside its loop so that nothing descends from it to its loop:.
Then, hold the medicine with your hand and rub it on the loop for half an hour until you see that it has turned black and cooled from the bite of the medicine; if desired, take a torn piece of cotton at one end of vinegar and dab it in the medicine.
The marrow enters through a catheter placed above until the resin adheres to the vessel, doing so repeatedly until one reaches the desired amount of grapes, then it is left there; it dissolves and drips after three or four days, prompting the need to replace the medicine.
After the patient cleanses around the grape with a suction catheter in lard and dries off any medicine surrounding it, then is submerged in cold water; treatment from outside with compresses and inside with enemas until he recovers; this type of treatment has been calmed by cutting and distancing fear.
The lather has also treated gently from the cut and poured on this type, taking fennel, dill, parsley, anise, caraway, coriander, cumin, and its like from herbs collecting them all or some in a vessel then soaked.
The cup overflows with filled wisdom bowl and is in the center of the cover a hole where the hollowed device attaches to this type, made from silver or copper.
The section that enters through the hole where the pearl is in the mouth of the patient until the steam rises into the tube, causing it to expand as much as possible, then making it return several times until it deflates, this treatment should be done at the first occurrence of a tumor.
It is common for the tumor to increase, so it should be done when her hot tumor subsides; take this device that does not have a nail on its end and attaches a layer of eggshell onto it to prevent burning the patient's mouth.
Because the eggshell layer prevents steam burns, this is a good treatment with its safety.
Chapter Eighty-Three and Thirty-Two. (Note: This appears to be a section or chapter title rather than a textual excerpt that can be translated)
From the ejected thorn and what protrudes from the esophagcu, except for others. (Note: This appears to be a section or chapter title rather than a textual excerpt that can be translated)
Often a bone or thorn protrudes from the esophagus, so it is best to remove them after they have been grasped with the device under sunlight. (Note: This appears to be a textual excerpt that can be translated)
To show you what is in the esophagus and not visible, it should be cleared of the patient before their food digests in their stomach, especially if something protruded with a swelling or the patient's throat collapses due to tissue strip or root. (Note: This appears to be a textual excerpt that can be translated)
He takes a piece of dry bread or a strip of soft sea sponge and attaches it to a thread, then allows it to sink; if it reaches the position of the arrowhead, it quickly attracts the thread, thus repeating this process multiple times.
The arrowhead or bone frequently gets stuck in it and comes out, but if not as mentioned above, a pencil device was used on this image.
It is thicker than the mucus a little and on its edge has an opening into which the tumor enters in a ring, gently raised with care to elevate its head above and protecting from touching its larynx so as not to cause coughing; it pushes out bones or arrows.
Inserting the tumor is better for knowing its position and pushing it down or pulling it up with a device as much as one can tolerate until it comes out.
The ninth and thirty-third section.
In the output of the nasal mucus in the pharynx.
If the mucus was treated as we mentioned in the section with medication and did not improve, then examine at sunset if there is a tumor in the pharynx after it has been caught by using the device described earlier.
Then, by placing your eye upon the pus, it will be drawn out with a small syringe or soft tube; if not possible then take a hollowed pipe and insert it near the affected area close to the pus, then insert another tube into the middle of the first pipe.
This is done repeatedly until the illness subsides for a day, then he takes a full cup of cold water and opens his mouth in it and pumps with it without spitting out any drops and moves the water afterwards after holding it for some time.
If you feel the pus on the scale, then it did not exit as we described and dried up with urine and sweat by using the apparatus that was mentioned in the Harem's kitchen, do this repeatedly until it falls off.
In the Harem's kitchen, one should take a pot of boiling water with its lid pierced in the center and attach it to that hole at the end of the apparatus then receive the patient and place the affected area at the end of the tube and close his mouth so that no steam escapes until he knows that the steam has reached the pus.
Then the sack falls on the spot, if it does not fall then it is reinflated multiple times, the illness endures thirst and eats salt, garlic, and does not drink water so as not to be expelled by this measure, here is an image of a device that attracts the sack from the intestine if it happens upon sight.
He resembles the colobrine as you see, except he has this adaptation that enters into the intestine and its end resembles a bird's beak with sharp scissors if it clamps onto something not to let go:.
Another device grips the tongue and is a wide snake made of iron as much as ten mouths over the tongue enters into it standing on its side, keeping the mouth open involuntarily due to illness and cannot be removed by force until it dislodges itself:.
The device that opens the mouth on this scale with his eye.
Chapter Forty-four.
He made a device from the speech that removes tumors and breaks them up.
Tumors of many kinds are mentioned herein in this book, each has its own section and they differ from one another in breaking up and removing them by two aspects - one type of tumor is the same and various fluids emanate from it.
The Second Type in the Positions of the Body because the accidental tumor in the head is not the incidental tumor in the buttocks and the incidental tumor on one side is not the incidental tumor in the joint for each one of them a verdict from work.
Of tumors, only those that have fully matured and completed their growth should be attached, including those not yet fully developed like nearby tumors to joints.
Because if the tumor occurs near a joint and takes some time to heal, it may possibly damage tendons or nerves of that joint, which can be the cause for prolonged duration of that limb or the tumor being close to a main organ.
Because if you delay surgery until it matures, that main limb could be damaged or the tumor close to the buttocks might have a motive and must fully mature near the buttocks before receding into them resulting in extermination of the centaur.
And in certain cases, it may not be curable, and one must know the time for surgery when tumors have matured fully, which is during the swelling of the tumor, pain and warmth from heat, paleness, numbness and bulging of the head of the tumor and all related symptoms.
It is proper to expect the lizard below the position of the tumor if possible, to facilitate drainage downward or in a lower location than the tumor and more painful; the lard should proceed along the body if the tumors are towards the hands and arms.
Position of muscles, tendons, nerves, blood vessels and in all levels where there is no bending, and as for those that are bent let the lizard go according to that position and if the tumor is in the meat areas then leave the lard.
Until maturity comes as we have said on completion, do not drain the secretion from it before that if you find it too abundant and impure and possibly its scales or skin hardened, some tumors may appear on the body when necessary or according to what the part needs.
It should be used with one lizard for small tumors and wide lizards or cuts for the size of the tumor, and it may happen that some tumors require hardening the skin and cutting if they have become like a tear.
The treatment in cases where one has died as is often seen in many dabails and tumors, where a hole is pierced that opens into three directions, and from it a piece resembling the leaf of an Armenian horse blossom is cut.
In cases where a curved, conical or similar incision is used, and if it does not have the characteristic head like a flat molluscum contagiosum lesion, then only a simple suture should be applied; however, if the tumor is large and has accumulated extensive tissue, preventing complete drainage at once, caution must be taken.
But it is extracted in parts, then the tumor is tightened until another day when more pus is also discharged; do this gradually until all of it is expelled.
Especially if the lesion is weak, or a woman who is pregnant, or a young child, or an old man - very often heals with pus discharge in stages; beware especially of this aspect as death may have occurred and you feel no warning signs.
After suturing such tumors, it is advised to clean the wound and observe that the wound from the tumor was small or that a simple incision was made; then use silk or cotton thread if the tumor is large with many incisions.
It was necessary to insert into every crevice of the tube so that one end meets the other, and if the tumor had pierced or shrunk part of the skin, it should be covered with cotton wool or catgut from dry material and tightened on the third day.
Then remove and treat it with appropriate compresses until it clears up, if there is bleeding during your work, use cold water and vinegar after having gulped them down, applying leeches to the site of bleeding multiple times.
Preventing bleeding requires the dressings and treatments we have described in many places of this book, divide it, for it is wintertime and the tumor site is sensitive; anoint with wine tonic oil or hot ointamoist.
Place it on the spot, if it is summertime and the site tender; bear with dressings anointed with water or oil and wine tonic ointment all cold until the third day as we mentioned before should dissolve the tumor and cleanse it.
In treating it until recovery, this is what you need to know about tumor treatment and the way of detailing: each tumor, how to treat it with a summarized method.
The surgical chapter forty-four.
On the incision of tumors found on the scalp.
Tumors on the scalp that are small and encapsulated have conditions as if they were chickenpox, with many types being fatty and some resembling a consistency similar to cottage cheese.
And from them, some with a consistency similar to pudding and semisolid in that manner, as well as some hardened ones; all are safe for incision without risking bleeding or discharge if not provoked during the cut of blood vessels.
The work of cutting it should first be done with the device that its image appears after this stage called "sculpting" until you understand what is at stake regarding how to incise a continuous long and simple cut on these images:.
Start the incision from line ~b~ to line ~j~ if the moisture leaks, empty the pouch where that moisture was and cut it all off, leaving nothing but a piece that often returns if anything remains of it.
Then immerse the cotton in astringent and if necessary, soak it in salt water; fill the wound with it and leave until tomorrow, as whatever remains of the bag will be consumed, then reapply the cotton with astringent for the second and third times if needed.
Until it becomes clear that nothing remains of the bag, treat the ward with bandages until healed; if the swelling is a fatty mass, remove it on this image:.
Make an astringent bandage and apply to all sides of the wound, squeeze it out, and rub your gauze in the drain bag that contains it; if you encounter resistance from a vein, perform as described by me afterwards, and likewise for the swelling if it is encapsulated.
Treat it as previously mentioned and incise the encapsulated tumor, which is easier because it has less blood and moisture; some of these tumors in the head are found in some people without any fluid, and this is why an attempt to incise a tumor was not successful.
The elderly woman had a large, hard white tumor like calcified stone that could not be broken even if thrown to the side of someone's face; and this was among other tumors found in the head, none of which were like these ones presenting in children'e skulls.
When removing the ears, tear them all apart simply and make the lobes loose from their bases to facilitate the flow of material downward, then treat it as appropriate according to the treatment method.
Chapter Two Hundred and Fourteen.
In the incision of pigs that often show exposure in the throat, these tumors are found in the throat and under the nipples and on both breasts, as well as throughout the body; the one exposed in the throat is among them, large, and some originate from others.
Each pig of them is inside a special container like the contents and brain tumors as we have described, and there are many types of these pigs that are calcified and some from which precipitations arise, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
What I observed of them was in good condition upon touch, its appearance closely resembled the skin color and moved to all sides without being torn by the neck tendon or tag or vessels. (This is a translation as per your request; however, keep in mind that this text appears to be related to Albucasis' work on surgical techniques.) It was necessary to tear it apart simply from above to below the body in this fashion along a line approximately A to B.: (This translation assumes that "~ج~" and "~ب~" are intended to represent specific points or directions on the pig's body for illustrative purposes.)
They strip her of all clothing and extend the ear skin with a pumice stone or two pumice stones, or many if necessary as we mentioned for head tumors, and remove them little by little until they are on the neck without cutting blood vessels or nerves, and the instrument used is not too sharp.
Do not extend your hand in cutting or worry the patient to cut what is unnecessary, for cutting blood vessels or nerves will hinder work and cause bleeding in the wound with ground powder or some plasters that stop the blood.
The wound is closed and left until the tumor bulk settles, then the wound rests to promote healing because when the blood stops it allows you to resume work until emptied; then inspect with your sponge fingers if anything remains so that other small khunazir can cut and cleanse them.
The original snake had a significant amount of blood, it was not to be cut but rather tied with a strong silk thread and left until something harmless falls off from it; then cover the ward with mallow leaves and drench it in Egyptian plaster paste.
If the pig has been entirely cut, it is necessary to collect its nails and tie the wound for an hour after learning that there are no remnants of stitches; if you see that a piece of the pig'amoeba bone remains, then collect its nails and tie the wound.
It was necessary to cut off its origin and root and use the suture, as we mentioned about pigs; for if you encounter wetness from it, tie a simple knot where the maturity is shown and make the thread hang down as we said.
Then use the Egyptian wrap and its method to eat what remains of the decay, until if you see the wound has been cured by using fresh bandages made from meat until it heals,
The third chapter and forty.
In the throat, a tumor occurs inside the pharynx.
The ancients mentioned this throat fissure, and I have not seen anyone in our country create it; this is their method of speech, but those who deal with slaughtering should avoid the throat cleft if they do not wish to be afflicted by it.
To ensure that all organs and lungs become diseased, if they have a hot tumor in the mouth or pharynx or tonsils, unless it is confined to the ducts, then using throat cleft should be utilized for escaping the defects causing suffocation.
It was necessary to drill the pharynx under three circles of its tube or four small slits with their width between two circles so that the slot is at the cornu and not in the membrane, and this position is agreeable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are far away, surgeon Jaban should extend the throat skin with a probe then drill the skin until reaching the tube next to the vessel if he sees anything there.
Then drill the slit as we described, and infer the incision of the tube from the larynx that exits it with what is congested and where the voice originates stops leaving the wound open at a time if the fear of strangulation disappeared gathering skin around the wurt.
And it cuts alone from the membrane then uses the drugs that cause meat to heal, said the author who wrote this book in explaining this phrase of speech we mentioned is if they saw the disease had closed its tube with one of these tumors you mentioned.
He ordered the patient to be observed for death and himself hoped that his gold would reach a crack in the palate so that the patient could breathe at the site of the wound, take some breaths, pass away peacefully, and leave the wound open until the wall of the disease is eliminated after about three days.
Then they ordered the stitching of the wound and its treatment until he recovered, which she witnessed herself take a scalpel and send it through her ear only to cut off part of her trachea in an attempt to treat him; she found that he was eating as if poisoned, and upon revealing the wound, it was discovered.
She found that the blood leaking from the wound was flowing, and she convinced herself that it did not bleed excessively or pus, and the smell of decay escaped from the wn; therefore, she decided to stitch and treat the wound until recovery without exposing anything except a slight voice.
And she returned to better health, from here it can be said that the crack in the palate was not dangerous.
Chapter Four and Forty.
In the case of a tumor showing outside through the throat, it is called laryngeal cyst.
This lump that is called Philum Helicoide is a large tumor on the body and it occurs in women mostly, of two types.
Either it is naturally occurrcuing or it occurs spontaneously; if it's natural, there's no cure for it and if it occurs spontaneously then one version resembles fatty tissues and the other resembles a complex tumor with a branch in its artery. It should not be exposed to iron at all except if it was small and it shrunk after being compressed with a bandage, as it resembles fatty tissue and is not attached to anything from the organ and branched out like on meat. Extract it after wrapping it in a pouch, or if inside a bag, examine all of them then treat the position as appropriate for treatment.
The fifth and forty-fourth section.
In the crack on types of meat.
There are many types of meats and all have been mentioned in the division; so let us explain here between meat and extraction when it is problematic, I say that extraction has heat with it, a boil, and suspected illnesses until the boils from leftovers cool down. The incense completes the tanning, causing redness and swelling; it contains no heat, inflammamoius properties, or pain relief, and is wrapped in a sackcloth bag with its own special pouch, colored like skin, initially resembling lemon peel but becoming flattened.
She is of two types, either incense or moisture with colors; if the appearance has been described in the section mentioned above, it should be examined and checked first by using the instrument called scalpel as it appears at this window.
Assess the size of the tumor, then remove the scalpel and observe what is left; if a simple crack has been described in previous sections as it appears after excision, if no residue is observed after using the scalpel, know that it is incense.
A more pronounced crack on this image as I informed you, label it with a tag and gently remove the skin from all sides while preserving it in a bag if possible to fully extract correctly along with the specimen.
When a cyst is incised and its discharge does not come out sufficiently, it is cut piece by piece until nothing remains; if anything remained, the condition would either decrease or increase the matter of trade.
Glabocephalis remained after the surgery when you left a wound with some sharp stitches and tightened the wound, placing something that nourishes the hot tumor above it; he treated it with all treatments until he recovered. It was a significant matter to notice his shaking eyes, which were treated by applying what soothes.
Your condition was characterized by a bleeding nose, either frequent or infrequent, and the flow of blood at the site was treated with powdered zajj; it was left tightened for two to three days until the wound healed and restlessness of blood occurred, then return to cutting what remained.
The Sixth Chapter and Forty.
In images of devices.
Those that act in the passage and are three types of it: major, middle, and minor; these are images of instruments.
Image of a large instrument:.
Image of a middle-sized instrument:.
Image: Small Scalpel
Image: A large Scalpel made of cast iron, square with four corners and a hollow center to accelerate entry into tumors; images of scalpels called "the cold," including three other types - barbs, awls, and minors.
Image: A medium Scalpel.
Image: Small Scalpel.
Surgical spoons are shaped like scoops and made from Chinese copper, brass, or of various metals including iron or silver; the best ones were crafted from brass.
Scalpels have also been made from blacksmith's iron and are used to excise tumors, allowing the incision to bend with it; they come in three types: long, medium, and short.
The hole is made as large or small as needed for each tumor, matching the size and narrowness of the scalpel; image of a large iron Scalpel.
Image of a medium iron Scalpel.
Image of a needle made of small lead:
Image of needles and there are many kinds because it is simple that has one tip and three types large, medium and small and among them the blunt needles and there are three types and among them the needles with two tips and there are three types and among them the curved needles with two tips. There are three types and among them the needles with three tips and there are three types and all of these kinds each one in its place, image of a simple large needle. Image of a simple medium-sized needle. Image of a simple small needle.

Image of a large clamp.
Image of an average-sized clamp.
Image of a small clamp.
His clips were limited in length and the other ends are unlimited, so it was only to assist in extracting substances during surgery when fear of cutting a vein or nerve arose or as used for tumors which found some relief from burning this procedure which he finds somewhat painful during excision.
Image of a large trepan, there are three types as some are large, others average and some small.
They craft an instrument from a copper alloy that polishes and in one end resembles the wide spout of a bowl, which consists of two plates with its handle hidden inside like a bird's tongue to allow it to be inserted and retracted as desired.
Image of a large forceps which the patient does not feel used to excise tumors, there are three types as some are large, others average and some small.
Image of a clamp used to stop bleeding, which is available in three kinds for adults, medium-sized individuals and small children, Picture of a large clamp.
These clamps are made from brass or steel, and as you can see in the picture, they are slightly elongated for ease of use. Such types should be available for adults and children to quickly stop bleeding when necessary and when there is no medication available.
However, they are not used for all parts of the body and only in muscular locations such as leg thighs, arm muscles, and the breast, as well as other moist fleshy areas.
Other small instruments resembling walnut shells as shown in the picture have also been made.
It stops bleeding if bleeding occurs from a puncture site or during incision of a vein, and instruments as depicted in the picture have been made to be slightly curved.
Chapter Seventh and Forty-Fourth.
In Treating a Male Goat.
In cases where the male goat resembles a female when full of dreams until it looks as swolamoonish and unattractive, one should scrape the fur on its body with a claw-like scraping motion in this manner.
From line ~b~ to line ~j~:. Then scrape off all the fat and fill the wound with a suturing thread. Suture the edges of the wound together and treat it until it heals, allowing the goat to rest its legs as women typically display theirs.
It was necessary to scrape on its upper edges with two claw-like scrapes resembling crescents, each one connecting the other at their end until the larger line encircles the smaller one in this form: From line ~b~ to line ~j~: then scrape the skin between the scrapes and remove fat, using the threading needle and suturing as we mentioned previously and anything else needed for treatment until it heals.
If it cannot accommodate the removal of a piece as necessary to alleviate concern or bleeding, it is required that you cover the wound with compressed cotton in an alkaline plaster and leave it until what remains of fat is consumed, then treat it until healed:.
Chapter Eighty-Fourth.
In the opening of tumors that are exposed to incision.
These tumors that are exposed to incision are a type of hard cancerous growth enclosed in a bag, and from it comes moisture like what came out was moisture should be scraped off with a crescent-shaped opening on this form.
From edge ~b~ to edge ~c~, if everything in the tumor has been emptied over a period of time using melted beeswax and left for another day then remove the wax.
Treat with the agreed bandage until healed, and it was a type of lymphatic cancer that was scraped off as we mentioned in the crescent-shaped incision on cancers so or even if the wound extended to become leathery, use what we discussed here for application.
Chapter Eighty-Fourth.
In the incision of a tumor that is exposed through blood vessels and called Anoresma.
If the blood vessel is injured and its overlying skin often exposes a tumor and likewise it also exposes to veins, there is swelling and a tumor within.
The signs known as tumor and swelling, if previously from a vessel or vein, the tumor is elongated grouped within the body's depth; if pushed by your finger it feels like it has scales.
The tumors originating from veins appear surface level, and surgery on these tumors is risky, especially in the groin, neck, and head, as they are quite large throughout the body and should be avoided with iron treatment.
Additionally, avoiding surgery in the limbs or head was also necessary from cases of vein bulging that created a longitudinal cut on the skin which then opened with pustules and caused the vein to slip out completely through purulent discharge.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and thread it to the other side, tie off the vein with surgical sutures in two locations you are familiar with from blood vessels within blood pockets, then cauterize at the point between the ligatures until all the contained blood exits.
The tumor is removed, then the treatment that produces scabs is used until sutures fall off, and it is treated with bandages as previously agreed upon until healed.
It was necessary to puncture the vein in order to grasp the tumor with your hand, then insert a needle below the position you have grasped and perform it with a double thread until exiting from the other side. Then the tumor is tied securely on each side of the string as mentioned for binding grapes, but beware that the strings may slip in, so insert another needle with another thread underne cuffing the whole tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
You tied the strings in four places, then you punctured the tumor in the middle until something comes out, so cut a skin thread and leave what is attached to it, then place a poultice that has been immersed in wine and oil on it. Then the treatment with a plaster and bandages is used until healed,.
Chapter Fifty.
In the tumor that shows an outward extension of a nerve.
As the tumor appears in the vein, so too does a tumor appear in the nerve if struck or caused by excessive fatigue and is more pronounced at bony prominences.
In every joint where movement occurs, the tumor is a subcutaneous one resembling the color of the body and usually painless; if pressed hard it feels like numbness and the tumors are not grouped deep in the body.
But it is under the skin and moves in all directions, neither forward nor backward; what appears at the joint should not be treated with iron lest it become a different condition or what occurred at the head or forehead.
Slice through the skin with a scalpel, if the tumor is small grasp it with forceps and cut it from its root; if large, attach a cauterizing clamp and cauterize it then extract it completely and gather the wound by suturing and treat until healed.
Surgical and fifty (referring to pages or chapters).
In the section on ligature cutting exposed in the abdamenon.
Many people may have them in their bodies and on the surface of their skin, small pouches known as cysts, similar to fungi, with a delicate origin and a thick head which can transform into smaller ones, making up a great number.
I have seen a man with two cysts resembling fungi, very thin in origin but which can transform and split, constantly releasing moisture from them; he cut one of them out weighing about eighty eight ountons and the other sixteen ounces.
The work in cutting them is that you find the cyst to be moist and the origin of the fungus very thin; cut it with a wide scalpel and add it often bleeds when brought into your fire pot.
If your bleeding is severe, then I saw the cyst as flat and was frightened to cut it with an iron knife; grab a thread of hard steel wire and tighten around this cyst described herein and leave it for two days then add pressure with the steel wire so that it continues to constrict.
Whenever the abscess is affected until it breaks and falls from itself without incision, then an early abscess will resolve with a slight fear and embarrassment, especially if it's in the abduct, but part of it might be separated or cut.
Then it is filled with ichor, and then treated until the wound heals; beware that exposing an abscess may become a tumorous growth causing little sensation but appears unattractive in appearance. In fact, it became known as cancer after this mention.
The Second and Fifty Seventh Chapter.
In treating urinary incontinence.
Urinary incontinence is from many causes: either due to a rupture of the bladder which has occurred on the abdomen causing it to leak, or due to blood escaping through a vein or artery presenting at the pubic region, or due to gas originating from a vessel, and also possibly from excessive heat in that area.
Previously, a rupture of the bladamo had occurred with urine leaking out; its color resembles that of skin and it is relatively painless but appears in different states. If previously the pouch was removed as we described, there would be a significant difference if it is squeezed with your fingers and then returned, possibly accompanied by trembling and considerable pain upon entering the bathroom and severe fatigue, but in reality it became softer.
If it is not squeezed with your hands and neither increased nor decreased, then indeed blood was present along these symptoms showing the tumor to be black, as in Albucasis's case of a firm solid mass that is confirmed by one method.
It was previously a smooth touch, and observing that it seems the secretion came from the blood vessels, veins or airways should be halted from treatment as I have informed you in the section where I mentioned tumors originating from blood vessels and veins. There is fear and reluctance associated with such cases.
It was previously a pouch or abscess that required being filled and standing extended, then learn with the string around it all. Then he orders you to hold his head between your hands, and then make an incision around the navel at the place indicated by a thread, extending it with a wide blade above the swelling, and then pull through the middle of the tumor using a large probe, finally securing the incision point with a string tied to a sturdy iron rod.
The ligature strings are then opened in the middle of the constricted tumor above the knot, and your little finger is inserted into it; if you find that the sack has been taken by the knots of the ligature, push the pouch inside and use a large probe to extend the incision.
Cut the ligature, and if it is a tube or clogged vein, return to your work and insert two strong threads into each needle, then insert the needles into the knot that you made around the tumor; tighten both the threaded needles on four positions of the needle.
And if you wish to remove the needle and leave it in place until the constricted flesh becomes moistened, falls off on its own or is cut (if the thread loosens), then treat as necessary with compresses until healed; it was a piece of tissue from his testicle.
He should be as if we said, and the tumor is dehydrated so that it leaves blood or fluid found in it, then treat it with what closes its position.
The Third Hundredth Chapter.
On treating cancer.
We mentioned in the division that types of cancer and how to treat it with drugs, warning against treating with iron lest it leaks out, and we mentioned ovarian cancer and a warning about its treatment.
The foremost mentioned that when cancer is in a position to be entirely removed as with cancers of the limbs or thighs, and how from the parts capable of excreting it by its entirety, particularly if small and early, and concerning those where it was great, do not approach.
Whoever was able to be healed by it, I have not seen before or heard of anyone achieving that, and what is done if it can proceed as we said the disease should advance from a black stage then attacking it if in the abdomen filled with bile.
Then the disease sets in a place where it can be worked on then received for the cancer of Sannoner that healed, and it is removed from all sides with skin over examination until nothing remains of its source, and let the blood flow freely without cutting quickly.
But in the era of positions, if you can clear all the thick blood with your hands or by any means possible, then stop working and let a large amount of blood leak from an artery cut or vein puncture until it stops, then treat it completely until healed.
Chapter Four Hundred Fifty.
In the treatment of hernia.
In the section on hydration, we have been informed about types of thirst and how to identify signs for each type as well as their treatment with medications, which are treated soleebat alone and do not approach solot or lahmatah at all.
That is a serious issue, if you have treated this type of hernia (strangulated) with medications and your treatment did not work, then it may be that the condition has worsened significantly or there was another disease without hernia like its own fever.
If you have severe diarrhea or symptoms approaching that, it means the disease has grown in strength and is not another disease without hernia by itself and was not a child nor an elderly man whose work requires resting while standing with your hands on your side to treat the illness. The patient is standing behind him, pressing his belly with his hands and pushing the water down to the side of relief, then he takes a branch-like instrument as shown in this image:
The two-ended long instrument, similar to a scalpel but with some blunt edges so it does not harm the abdardines when working towards the incision and then evacuates what was generated from one of the intestines.
It should be pierced from the navel downwards by three fingers, so that if there was a kidney stone previously, it would have been generated before you make your incision near the navel with three fingers; for if it were due to gallstones, then make your incision on the right side by three fingers.
Additionally, the incision made on the side where the patient desires should not be such that curiosity causes it to slip into a weak spot; then puncture with the skin hook and completely insert it there before pulling up your hand.
Using the scalpel between the skin and subcutis as if you were peeling it off, so that the depth of peeling is about a finger or more, then puncture the subcutaneous layer until the scalpel reaches an empty space which is the location of fluid, then remove it and enter into the hole indicated by this image.
It was a semi-tube made of fine tubing, crafted from silver or copper or ebony ivory with smooth holes: one small hole at the bottom and three holes on each side as you see.
He placed the tip of it on a ram's horn handle as in this image:.
In its upper part, a coil mechanism; if it reaches water, it will descend from the clock onto the device, allowing an average amount of water to flow through within the time that is appropriate, as if you have emptied more than necessary during that time so that the animal may die by disintegration of its spirit.
Or it presents to him as near death, but discharge from it according to its strength and what is indicated by the state of the animal: the vitality and coloration, then the device ejects and confines the water, thus being indicative that it has contained from within its clock.
Due to the skin that is gripped by the hole on the ram's horn handle, then the device returns on another day if you perceive the animal as possibly being affected again in this manner.
Additionally, the water flows out of a small container; do this for several days with your neck and avoid mistakes until only clear water remains. If it has improved, leave some water in it and bury it in hot sand to treat effectively.
Shower frequently in the bath and sunlight, stay hydraturate, treat with dried medicines until healed; vomit on the stomach, liver, and gallbladder as described further:
Chapter Five Hundred.
In treating children who are born uncircumcised or have narrow foreskin openings, etc.:
Some boys may be born with an uncircumcised foreskin and penis, and it's best to begin the incision within a few hours after birth:
On this delicate image:
Then, place a thin iron rod in the opening and tie it off for three or four days until urine flows naturally, unless the rod falls out; this will ensure that the opening remains intact:
As for those whose puncture is narrow, they are treated with lead as we have said for many days until it widens; and among them those whose puncture is not in its place, that from them a new one forms at the end of the kermes so that it does not defecate to the right.
Until the drainage is raised above his hand and no new one forms from before, so that the manure does not reach the liver on its own in a severely dirty state, with work being done to make the disease rise onto its back.
Then his kermes is stretched far with his left hand and the back of the puncture is scratched or cut deeply like a large pen so as if cutting something to be in the middle similar to a kermebut the puncture falls in its proper place.
And by your work, bleeding often exposes it being cut and treating the wound until healing. (This sentence seems incomplete or out of context as provided.)
The Sixth Hundreds. (This appears to be a section title from Albucasis' textbook on surgery.)
In the blister that appears on the covering, kermes, blackness, and gangrene with adhesion of the covering to the kermebe. (This sentence seems incomplete or out of context as provided.)
Often, this rash appears in the urine and is a symptom of severe jaundice; it should be mildly colored when drained into a container.
It is then drained completely, and a cloth soaked in Egyptian plaster is applied to it; after that, the treatment continues with Indian plaster until healed, and if the rash is severe yellowish-colored, the poultice should be used after cutting and cleaning.
If the rash was not uncovered and some of it was inside while others were outside, first remove the one from inside until healed; then treat the ones that are on the outside.
Since you treat them together without securing the dressing not to leak, they may also present blackness and decay under the dresser; it should be taken into consideration that anything darkened and rotten must all be cured or treated if infected.
Then cover it with honey mixed with ground pomegranate peels and resin, then continue the treatment until healed; if there is bleeding, a crescent-shaped bandage should be used on this image: [Image Placeholder].
Indeed, the meat is beneficial for both conditions by bleeding and wound if it becomes putrid; the thigh was eaten and returned with its flesh in time that should enter into the penis tube through a tube of lead to cure the illness on him, and as for the adhesion of the casing to the meat.
And this adhesion only occurs where it was properly covered and should not have been torn; its exposure before being shown by a wound or tumor should be stripped off with tweezamolet until the knot is untied and the meat is freed from all sides.
The difficulty in distinguishing it upon examination should be peeled off something from the meat and the casing so that if the casing is thin, then quickly pierced through its layer, then separated the casing and the meat with a fine scratch such as may have been dipped in cold water not to adhere also.
Then it is treated with a compress until congealed.
The seventh and fifty chapters.
In purifying the boys and treating what is presented to them as a fault.
The adhesion is not something other than separating the connection as seen in surgeries except that from our actions and use of it among boys, there is a need to draw its best work.
The easiest way to safety, so I say that the preliminaries were not mentioned in any of their books because it was not used in their jurisdictatury, but this is what we have obtained them.
In the experiment, we found that the audience of craftsmen and barbers use cleaning with scrapers and razors, as well as using clippers and tying with thread and cutting with nails on the fingers. We tried all these methods.
I did not find a better method of cleansing than with the razor and tying with thread because cleansing with scrapers often led to the skin peeling off, as the scalp layer has two layers, so that it might be cut by the upper layer and the lower one remains.
He was forced to cut another one and the patient suffered from it, because he does not believe in cutting on the edge of excision as it may enter into a hole. As for cleansing with nails, perhaps the skin peels off and spoils your work or the scalp layer is short by nature.
They often produce it without needing cleansing, and I saw that, as for the experiment of cleaning with the razor and tying with thread showed its superiority because the razor is proportional to cut from above for the purpose of getting a shave higher than the one below.
At times, when the hands are proportionate to each other and cut in one measure at once with scissors almost like a wall for the strip of dissevered skin from all edges without any error being associated with it, the work is first intended to deceive the child.
Especially if one is only fastening the strip after dissection and bringing it to another day, then releasing and hiding it completely as you can, using his understanding of what he accepts mentally, stop it between your hands with full uprightness.
Sitting and hiding the scissors in a pocket or under your foot so that no trace of it is on the child's eyes, then you enter to dissect and inflate in the skin and pull it upwards until the dissevered strip comes out completely.
Then cleanse what comes together with dirt, then fasten the teaching point to a side strip and then attach below it another band shortly after that, grip with your thumb and forefinger the lower fastening tightly and cut between both bands. Then lift the skin quickly and extract the head of the dissevered strip, then let the blood run a bit as it is better and lessens the incisions, then dry it with damp gauze, and dust on charred pumice powder as best you've tried or fine powder of honeycomb ash also.
Then lift the skin quickly and extract the head of the dissevered strip, then let the blood run a bit as it is better and lessens the incisions, then dry it with damp gauze, and dust on charred pumice powder as best you've tried or fine powder of honeycomb ash also. Then place the gash on top of a bowl containing boiled egg yolamoan mixed with rose water, stirred with rose oil until it heals completely through all treatments.
This is the image of the scalpel used for sterilization:.
The incisions made by a cutting lancet with no curvature, dipped in disinfectant should be as long as the blades of both handles, while for sterilization it is preferable to stretch the skin completely or partially when cutting using your finger on the clock before it begins to bleed.
She cut it on an even surface; if she could not grip it with her finger, use a clamp and cut it off, then wait three days as it swells under the sinews, presses down and inflates until the cancerous lump is filled in easily.
Cut it as you deem fit, and if a piece is removed from the scalp near the incision, that does not harm it; treat it with what soothes the wound as we described in the article on wounds.
If a skin section is cut and shrinks on top, it will not be excessively harmful either; treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Eighty-Five.
In treating urinary retention in the prostate.
Urinary retention in the prostate is a blockage from calcifications, blood clots or sloughed tissue and suchlike; if treated as we have described above in lithotomy.
Urine has not passed and you suspect that the blockage is due to a stone in the urethra, it should become an illness on its back; then sit with your legs raised and place one foot on your chest and extend your abdabutches towards your chest and hold the obstruction as much as possible.
Therefore, the urethra must push the stone back to allow urine flow; if it has not passed as we mentioned and the matter worsens for the patient then they should use an apparatus called Qatha-Tur which is this form: [Here would be a description or illustration of the Qatha-Tur, typically used historically in urological procedures].
It is made of silver and finely filigree, shaped like a pheasant's feather in the form of a long tube measuring about half a cubit with a delicate lid at its head, which attracts urine so that it takes two twisted threads tied firmly on either end. [This describes an instrument used for urological procedures to aid in urination or removal of obstructions.]
The thread enters at the bottom of the catheter and is pulled out slightly so that a portion of the wool goes into the tube, which it seals like a plug, then coats the catheter with oil or butter or egg yolk, and places the patient on a chair.
The catheter is gently inserted into the opening of the bladder until it reaches the base, then bends upwards towards the neck and pushes the catheter inside.
Until the catheter is pushed inside until it approaches near the vagina, if the male tends to lower down and the catheter remains inside, then pushes it until it reaches the uterus, and the patient feels that something empty has been reached.
Yet, this is done on this level because the tube that carries urine in it swells, then the thread with wool is extended slightly and as a result, the urine follows the wool, then expel it and drain the urine, and return the catheter.
It continues to do so until the bladastermine empties and the patient finds it light, indicating successful treatment or relief of symptoms.
Chapter Nine Hundred and Fifty.
How to insert the bladder using a catheter.
The tools that are used to treat this are made of silver or ivory hollow with a long tube on parchment and it is intended for the water and medicine to flow through in what is called a catheter, and here is the image of it.:
It is made of silver or ivory hollow with a long tube on parchment paper, all sides are covered and there are two holes from one side and one hole from the other as you see.:
The central position where you place the plunger on a vessel until it is filled without anything more added unless it attracts moisture from which it absorbs, and if pushed with it will push to a distance as is created by the pipette that throws oil in sea battles.:
If you want to remove moisture from the bladjar insert the end of the catheter into the water and attract it with the plunger upwards so that the moisture is drawn into the body of the catheter, then enters its end in the drainage as described by us in the pipette, and then pushes the moisture back with the plunger.:
Indeed, that moisture reaches the gallblader to the extent that the patient feels it; and this is also a gentle image of being inserted into the gallblader.
Made of silver or ivory, its top resembles a small clamp and under it is a cavity in which the threads are placed; then gall bladder chickens are taken and placed into them with the moisture that one wants to inject into the gallbladder, then they are tied together by strong twine.
That moisture is heated a little on the fire and then inserted into the injection side in the abscess, which pulls your hand tightly onto the gallblader with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the gallbladder.
The gallbladder has not been prepped, cut out a piece of paper and drilled it all around then inserted a thick string through that hole as if to circle then gathered the circle like gathering silverware after placing in them the desired moisture, ointments, and water.
Then tie it on the instrument and make it as you made from the gallbladder with your hand until the moisture reaches the gallbladader.
Chapter 62: Treatment for Cataracts and Blindness Caused by Them
Out of the crushed lenses.
We discussed dividing types of calculi, treating them with medication, distinguishing between calculi formed in the kidney and those formed in the gallbladder, their respective signs, and when work is done by hand or chisel.
Cholelithiasis is specific and those that form in the bile duct, I explained it with a clear definition and summary.
I say that calculi formed in the gallbladder are more common among men, and their sign being bile exiting the gallbladder resembling water in its thinness.
It shows as sand, mentioned and abused with it frequently descends then spreads along with the sigmoid colon, commonly in many cases, adolescents are misled to believe they reach fourteen years of age while seniors find it troublesome, adults fall somewhere in between these ages.
Larger ones are easier to treat than smaller, so when describing treatment it should first involve injecting the patient with a syringe that expels all pus within it, potentially preventing calculi at inspection.
Then the patient is seated with legs elevated, and he leans down so that all stones pass into the urethra or are expelled from a raised position several times; then he sits between your hands, supine, with his legs up for the bladamoind to relax completely.
Then it occurs to me that if I feel the stone in the air, you should have taken hold of it within your hour by scratching it; if it is a boy or if you use the middle finger, dab some oil from the left hand with your thumb before examining.
If it is a completely male, insert your finger into his anus and examine for the stone until it slightly slips under your fingertip towards the urethra, then grasp with your finger and push outward toward where you want to open up.
And the master orders his left hand to open wide and another master's right hand is extended upwards towards the female anatomy, while their other hand stretches out the skin under the females toward the position where the incision will be made; then they take the sharp instrument that this image depicts:.
He made an incision between the male and female, not in the middle but towards the left side. The incision is on the same level as the finger that you place in the vagina, pressing it outward to make a wide opening from outside and a narrow one inside according to how much the bone can be extracted.
The bone that you press with your finger at the incision may come out easily, and know that it may be an irregular bone or one with sharp angles for a difficult exit due to its shape.
Of these, the one resembling an oak is easier to extract due to its shape; however, if it had angles and sharp edges in the incision that were slightly deeper, it should not come out easily but rather be grasped with a firm fist like a hammer handle.
To secure the bone and prevent it from moving or sneaking in underneath, you should gently insert a narrow instrument; if you cannot slightly widen the incision, then use something sharp like a knife to cut through any blood clot.
If there is one large and one small bone to be pressed first into the urethral orifice, then make an incision and push both; if there are more than two, they can be very large, which would require making a larger incision as it exposes severe conditions that need to be addressed.
Either he dies or it happens to him: the bladder is always made perforated for this reason, so that it does not adhere to the place and they try to push it out as much as possible until it exits entirely, or it is pierced completely with the forceps until it comes out.
If the wound you treated has become a sore, and is swollen and hardened, and appears to be perforated with oil, wine or rose water, and cold water cools down the inflamed tumor; then leave it until on the third day the bandage loosens.
If the bandage dissolves with much water, treat it with a white plaster and a salve until he recovers; then if the wound presents an inflamed tumor which is hot to the touch, bloody, pus-like, like blood that has congealed in the udder, causing retention of urine and resulting from discharge of blood with the urine.
If you insert your finger into the wn, and then extract blood from it; if pus or a foul smell remains as in udder infection causing mastitis and septicemia, then wash the wound with vinegar, water, salt for all kinds of treatment until healed.
It is necessary at all times during treatment to connect the thighs and gather them in order to confirm the placement of the medicine placed on the spot; however, the pill was small and became stuck in the bone shaft and protrude, causing the urine not to leave as I have described before it reaches the kidney.
Often I have relied on this treatment for the kidney stone, and it is to take iron filings as depicted in the image:.
The sharp tip is deeply inserted into the tube, then a string is attached to the bone below the pill so that it does not return to the kidney, and iron filings in the solution are gently introduced until they reach the same pill.
You manage the pill with your hand at the same location, slowly and gently pushing a hole through until it protrudes from the other side; then urine flows out when its time comes, and you hold onto what remains of the pill outside the bone shaft, which dissolves and leaves along with the urn while curing the illness.
It may not seem like this treatment can be hindered by any obstacles, so tie a string under the pill and another over it then gently scratch on the pill in the same bone shaft between the two strings to extract it.
Then the bandage dissolves and removes the clotted blood that has formed in the wound, but it must be tied undernepressure so as not to return to the abdominal cavity or another knot from above should the string dissolve after removing the pressure, causing the skin to return to its place over the bandaged wound.
Therefore, you should tie the upper string so that your skin rises above it and covers the wound as we have said.
Surgery and Stitching.
In the case of uterine pressure for women.
A little while ago, if one of them conceives a pregnancy during the use of a uterine pressure device, it can be very difficult to treat and often results in either abortion or not being able to find another woman willing to allow herself to be treated by a physician.
If she is a spinster or has many husbutes, and you cannot find another woman willing to help improve this profession, especially manual laborers, then the position of strain on the uterine pressure device from women will be too far removed from its intended location, necessitating an additional incision.
In such a case, the necessity dictates that it would be best for a skilled female physician to seek assistance from another competent woman or request an unmarried male assistant or arrange for another capable woman in women's affairs or one familiar with this field through some indication.
He ordered that she prepare everything he commanded in the examination of the urine, first to determine if the woman was pregnant and then to enter her finger into her vagina and examine the menstrual blood and press it with her finger.
Then he ordered her to be perforated, but she was not pregnant and the cloth said that it commanded her to insert her finger into the vagina and examine the menstrual blood after placing her left hand on the uterus and squeezing it well.
It was found that she should be lowered down to the uterus from her mouth until it reached the end of her thighs, then scratch her at the midpoint of the vagina near the anus either from right or left and feel for blood in that area.
Her finger does not fail to feel the pressure of the menstrual blood beneath it, and initially perform a small incision on that small cut then insert the rod into the cut if she feels blood in the cut increase as far as she knows that the menstrual blood is coming out from there, know that there are many types of menstrual blood.
From them, small and large, spindle-shaped, oval, circular, and those with known types of heads to deduce what you want; if excessive bleeding occurs, clot it at the site by applying a powdered substance and hold for an hour until the blood stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone is passed, work on the same tools you mentioned for men to assist in your task; if excessive bleeding occurs and you feel a pulse of blood indicating that an artery has been severed, apply a clot at the site using powder or other methods until the bleeding stops.
Wrap it tightly with a bandage and leave it; do not remove it or let the stone pass out until the condition has resolved, then treat the wound if there is swelling of blood after days and the position heals, then return to your work until the stone passes out.
Chapter Two and Six.
On a water supply conduit.
The water pipe is essentially a collection of humidity in the white cornea that surrounds the egg and called spermatic ducts, which may be located within a special membrane initiated by nature on one side of the egg.
Until he believes it is another egg and lies between the skin of the perineum and the white thread we mentioned, which can only happen in a rare case, and this instrument produces from weakness exhibited by women the position to be held for this material and may have been struck upon women.
This moisture has many colors, either it is yellow or blood-red or scabrous black or watery white and the more so, and the signs known by him.
Where the meeting of water is that in the white thread we mentioned, the tumor becomes somewhat cylindrical like an egg and no pus appears because moisture surrounds it from all directions on the sores.
And if the moisture is in a dense layer, then the tumor becomes cylindrical from one side like an egg.
For this, a person presumes it to be another egg; and if the moisture is between the skin of the perineum and the white thread we mentioned, then it lies under the touch, and as for knowing the color of the moisture, examine the tumor with the square figure you presented its image and what comes out from it determines by its content.
If we treat with iron, it is advisamoble to instruct the wound to be closed if possible and I saw its body filled, then it glistens on its back slightly and places a large tear beneath it and you sit on its left side.
The server orders you to sit on its right side and extend your arm, exposing the skin of the flank and towards the middle of the abdangle. Then he takes a wide scalpel and cuts the skin of the flank from the center almost up to the incision.
The incision is made straight, parallel to the line that divides the skin of the flank into two until it reaches the white fascia and extracts a flap, keeping from making another cut and ensuring your graft remains attached on the side closer to the whiteness, examine as much as possible.
Then the flap is filled with water and a wide bucket, then it separates between the edges of the incision using sutures and extends the flap upwards without touching the skin of the flank while cutting as much as possible either in one piece or cut by cuts.
Particularebly the finer side, if you do not examine it to see whether the water has returned and pus comes out through its skin while working on it, when the fragment of bone is removed, gather together the threads with sewing needles.
Then treat it with the surgical method until he recovers, if the pus has become rotten from another disease, tie the vessels related to preventing bleeding, then cut the fistula and remove the egg. Treat it as we have mentioned above.
Both sides of the water collected together, you should know that they caused separation on the other side what was done first in any case; so do one operation and cleanse the blood.
In the incision, introduce cotton soaked in oil or rose ointer; when another cotton emerges from outside that was soaked in syrup and oil, loosen it on both fistulas and abdominal membrane, then place a rolled up bandage over the wound. And bind it with the bandage that has six edges as shown in this image: (Note: Since there's no accompanying image, translation ends here.)
Then take two needles, stretch a piece of woolen cloth over this example, and form the legs from cotton or damp wool tied together with a strong knot in the thong belt. One leg takes on the seat up to the chest.
Then take two pieces to resemble the thighs, from below on each leg and both remaining legs above the calves, tie all with a strong knot in the thong belt, and this device can also be made of wood instead of iron.
It is to take a fine scalpel and incise the corpse's skin, with an apron as described until the white sack of water in the leg from another mocker on this figure unfolds.
It resembles the Greek eye, then is tied with it and an apron until all moisture escapes from it, then stretches the sack with scissors and peels off the layered covering by scalpel as much as you can to extract everything, keeping the egg intact without being touched by flame.
Be aware that this work is a solution and more effective than blood-letting, if you oppose in the joints or during an accidental cut, sunstroke, hemorrhage, or any other occurrence that you should address by treating all as I instruct on what suits your case.
Indeed, the disease was a swelling and it could not be endured with this work due to its odor, so let the assistant do what I described, if it is correct for you as we have provided from the materials.
The device is aquatic and the patient should be seated on a high chair, then applying pressure to the swelling below it with a wide instrument; have the assistant position along the body so that the opening is wide enough for all the water to flow out, then place on a sling and tie.
Leave to drain any remaining water, then treat until the wound heals; indeed preventing water from draining while pumping is due to the white membrane obstructing in the mouth of the wnud.
Thus, it is necessary to introduce ewe's urine or the device that extracts water from pus into the wound; indeed apply slightly at the opening of the wound as provided in its image or injection.
And know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so if it collects in its kind on pustule; indeed the patient will defend days of their illness, etc.,
Chapter Three and Sixteen.
In the case of a puncture in the meat instrument, its treatment.
I know that a puncture on this instrument of lard can lead to death in most cases, so we observe it and its safety from there, remembering the work done with it, and types of tumors.
I say that many tumors may occur in the bodies where it is composed of females, and this is for several reasons: either from a predisposition to women or from a blow which results in women and the color of the tumor matches the body's color and no moisture is found within it.
The tumor will be solid and possibly the tumor was encapsulated with color as if it were a paste, without sensation, and may result from complexities of blood vessels or swelling such as mentioned by him; or from swelling of glands. When there is swelling in the blood vessels, that is known to have spread out the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers and it should not show a bump, or the one that is from gland swelling does not spread upon pressing with fingers, this type can be punctured on itself and others of similar nature.
He is to scrape the skin, then extend the egg white over it and remove it from the white cloth, and discharge the blood vessels and tie the veins, then reattach them after draining each side of the egg whites, so that the meat was cured with those detached meats.
The egg should be removed and cut, if there is adhesion between a piece of cloth or the veins, it is necessary to remove all that adhesion and cut it into round slices.
The meat at the adhesion point, which is behind where it was said to cut all of it and remove the egg white as we mentioned before if you have worked on your wound with soaked cloth in rose water and vineger then treat it with the full treatment until healed,.
Chapter Four and Six.
In treating the affected arm with the device. (Note: The provided text seems incomplete or incorrect for a translation, it might be a part of a sentence in Arabic.)
The device is a woolen dressing with the scent of herbs, soothing for women and helps with movement disorders, sports injuries, walking, and in treating this condition it provides relief closer to what men's pants provide. (Note: This translation might have some ambiguities due to potential text fragmentation or contextual limitations.)
However, it should be noted that the procedure performed earlier is relevant, so I say that the patient should sit on a raised chair and then pull down a female girdle, after which they should grasp the exposed artery with your fingers using a nearby vessel.
He holds it with his hands and extends the suture tightly, then makes a deep incision near the vessel's edge to expose it completely, after which he removes each part as previously mentioned in the arterial ligature section, and finally inserts a threaded needle into it.
He secures it at the first exposed positions where function was shown, and also at the last ones; then he opens a longitudinal incision in the middle and extracts what accumulated within the dried pus cavities.
Then the surgeon treats the tumor with a method to induce a period during which the vessel feeding one of the women may fall out, and all vessels have shown function; it is necessary for one woman to expel the vessel along with her menstrual blood without harm to ensure proper nourishment. By dissecting the vessel, it collapses and does not inflate again.
Chapter Five and Six.
In the treatment of internal prosthesis.
This prosthesis arises from a slit that is lengthened along the abdamen approaching towards the umbilicus, extending to the fallopian tube therefrom into the uterus on one side.
This incision is either from a split or its extension and occurs for various reasons such as trauma, electrocution, explosion, or lifting heavy objects; hence signs may appear if the extension of the laparotomy occurs gradually over time.
The tumor does not suddenly occur; it is similar in depth before the laparotomy compresses the cavity, and signs may manifest if the split occurs immediately with severe pain pushing through to the surface where the tumor appears different under the skin nearby.
This occurs when the cavity exits through the laparotomy and may egress with mucus called an internal, mucoid prosthesis which can be accompanied by a foul odor, and in cases where the peritoneum is involved, entrapment could occur along with necrosis of the disease.
Because it causes a severe and squeezing pain, especially if bled, treating these types of this condition with iron is risky to prevent recurrence, the method should compel the disease to return to the cavity through his hand into himself.
Then he drapes between his hands and raises his leg, extending the skin that was on the donkey upwards and scratching off all of the fat tissue then squeezes out droplets into the crevice to open it with enough pressure.
The crevice will be as far as the egg can come out, then drainage tubes underneaster skin until the white hard pus comes out from all sides, then insert your little finger into the egg.
Between the white pus under the egg skin and between the second abscess, where the adhesion from behind the egg releases with it, then turn your right hand towards inside the fat tissue and while doing so extend the white pus to the top by left hand and raise the egg with the pus to the crevice.
The steward ordered the egg white to be poured over and released all adhesions that had formed completely, and then you should check with your finger to ensure there is nothing from an infected pouch in the solid white mass; if something is found, press it into the abdamain.
Then take a needle with a thick thread that has been spun from ten threads, and insert it at the far end of the pouch underne groin skin where the opening is visible; then cut off both ends of the looped thread so that there are four strands. Then twist one on top of the other and securely fasten the pouch we said is under groin skin with a tight knot from two sides; also tie off the ends of the strands and then join them firmly until nothing can flow through to reach it. So that from there, a red swelling and then tie another knot further out beyond the first one by at least two fingers; after these two knots, pull on the pouch under groin skin as much as you can with your fingernails.
So that from there, a red swelling and then tie another knot further out beyond the first one by at least two fingers; after these two knots, pull on the pouch under groin skin as much as you can with your fingernails. The remainder is then curved off and the egg is extracted along with it, then a downward incision is made in the skin of the pustule from which blood and pus are drained as we have described in what follows, then linen soaked in oil is used and placed on the wound and the dressing that we described.
The white rag that we mentioned after cutting should be carefully wrung out to avoid losing too much blood, and the dressing should remain until it falls off by itself; if it is slowed in its falling, warm salty water should be poured over it and allowed to drip wet as long as possible.
Then the wound is treated with complete surgical treatment until it heals.
Chapter six and seven.
In this wind instrument, I have not seen anyone boast of treating it with iron as described in the instrument we mentioned that has a valve and is connected to the vessels below after being incised on them carefully.
Then it is incised in the middle and treats the tumor as it opens until the vessels fall off; then the wound is treated according to what we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Seventh and Sixty-Second.
In the joint that is in the arboreal.
It may present the arboreal joint as we have described in the previous chapter, and nothing from the bursa protrudes to the female side; if it does, then it flows smoothly and is found at all times.
However, if it is left for a long time, the gap in the fossa increases until the bursa and tendon protrude through the fissure and are displayed as an extension of the fossa that is in the arboreal, as we mentioned before. This means that it extends the fossa, then relaxes and brings the position back to normal, and its treatment is as I described it earlier.
This can be treated with iron, and it involves elevating the ailment on its back between your hands then tearing the protruded joint space to create an opening of width about three fingers wide and securing the fossa underneath the skin.
Until if the white fossa that follows takes a recess it places on top of the protruded fossa and wraps it deep into the abdomen, then ties both positions around the edge of the recess from the fossa with a needle.
Then soothe the swolabund side and do not cut the abscess, nor touch the egg white, or anything else as you have been instructed in the treatment of conjoined instruments, then treat it with surgical procedures.
If the sutures of her clean wound and fissure have healed, then the abscess will constrict and does not increase the tear.
And this is the best in this position because it is closest to safety.
Chapter Eight and Sixty-Two.
In the relaxation of skin scar tissue.
The skin scar tissue often relaxes in some people without relaxing the muscles inside it and its appearance, so those who wish to treat it should allow the patient to sleep on their stomach.
Cut all the skin that has relaxed on thick skin, and if you wish to sew first, use three or four sutures of the relaxed skin and secure it with a thread then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with topical surgery until healed and the stitches fall out,
Chapter Eighty-Six.
In Uterine Prolapse
In cases of uterine prolapse, it is considered permissible by our law.
For this reason, it was not necessary to mention it in my book, but I mentioned it twice for the benefit of doctors if asked about it and to know its treatment and the other point that we often need castration for our benefits.
As with pregnant women, eunuchs, and cats, for example, of animals such as these, I say that castration is done either willingly or by force and cutting; those done willing are made to sit in hot water until the female reproductive organs relax, contract, and fall out.
Then you hold it until the reproductive organs dissolve and disappear to touch, as for castration by force and cutting, it should be held securely, pressing its skin with your left hand then tie the cordage and scrape on each eggshell hole one cut at a time.
Only after they have risen, cut them off once they are shed and leave no trace of the old fine membrane that is on the vessels; this type of castration is better than the one done willingly.
Because perhaps the healing in women may provoke an amorous animal, then treat the wound until it is cured.
Chapter Seventy-seven.
In treatment of hermaphroditism.
The hermaphrodite is in men of two types, one where it appears to resemble a female and the other within the scrotum among women, appearing like a woman's penis with hair and expelling urine from the urethra.
As for in women, there is one type where the vulva resembles small male genitals and opens to the outside as if it were a man'hemale penis with two appearing like female characteristics; treating the three types of hermaphrodites.
The two types in men and the one type in women should be cut to remove the excess flesh until its effects are gone, then treat them with the general surgical methods until they recover; as for the second type of men from whom urine exits but is not within the scrotum nor do they have a penis.
Chapter Seventy-seven: The Surgical Methods. Chapter Eighty.
In amputating the testes and removing excess flesh from women's labia.
The testicles may perhaps increase in the usual manner, becoming swolamoist and reddened, sometimes more pronounced in some women to spread like men and lead to pregnancy.
It was desirable to hold the testicles in your hand or on a cup and cut them, not squeezing within the cuts nor especially deep at the root so as not to expose bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical therapy until recovery, and what about the testicular tissue is a meat growing in the uterus to fill it.
And perhaps it exited outward like an example of tail. Therefore, some elders call the tail-disease by cutting it as one would cut the testicle and treat it until recovery.
The second chapter seventy-two.
In treatment of shortening (likely referring to a surgical procedure for correcting elongated structures).
Shortening is the woman's vagina not being foreskinned or having a small hole, which can be either natural and giving birth with it or acquired through an operation, in which case it might be due to protruding testicular tissue that was overgrown. (Note: This translation may require medical knowledge to interpret correctly as the term 'رتقاء' is not standard.)
He should make a very fine or thick tube, either in the depth of the uterus or on its sides or above it or below it, which prevents hemorrhage and childbirth and perhaps menstruation, and this is possible to achieve by examination.
If the obstruction appears close, but not actually present, it should be examined with its fingers or a probe; if the obstruction is very fine and near the labia majora, causing them to break easily, then put two thumbs of each hand together as if they were pincers.
The woman lies on her back, and extends one leg; then she forcefully pulls the labia majora until the fine obstruction is ruptured and the blockage opens up; then she takes wool (likely for cleaning purposes) soaked in oil and places it at the location. Every day, she brings together all her limbs to prevent re-inflammation of the area.
If the obstruction is thick and dense, it should be scraped with a flat blade resembling paper; if the blockage is made of unprocessed fat, hang it on hooks, cut it, and keep medications to combat bleeding from non-traditional sources such as quail's droppings, shellfish, or milk at hand.
Then a tube of clay is used to gently burn the wound, which it holds for several days, and a cotton thread is then used to treat all aspects of healing until recovery; here, a plant may be presented on the liver that should cut according to this type.
If it is not a sarcoma, then the cancerous tumor in the liver does not present itself as hardened iron.
The Third and Seventy Chapter.
In the treatment of abscesses, thorns, and red blisters that present in women's genitals.
As for abscesses, they are an accumulation of abdomamen until blood pours out continuously; if the abscess turns into thorns, it has been mentioned that types and signs are distinguished herein.
What it accepts treatment and what it does not accept, I say that abscesses and thorns are present deep in the liver if they have not been felt; there is no iron treatment for those within the mouth of the liver where sensation occurs to them.
It is proper for a woman to enter a warm place, then to extend thorns with scissors or rough blade and cut from its roots, then sprinkle it when blood leaks from one of the stopping points that stop bleeding from the blood.
"Like the quail and chicken, and its kind; then raise her legs up to the wall for an hour; then lower them in cold water so that bleeding stops. She sits in a saucepan with semolina, pomegpertle peels, and onion skins. Then take flour from wheat grass and knead it with honey and vinegar.
"Then bind it on her back so that the bleeding stops and if necessary, take a piece of firm meat from animals without castration; then soak the bandage in trathith juice or almilla syrup or licorice root extract with vinegar.
"If the tumor is effectively treated with bindings until recovery, as for red pustules resembling coarse hair on the scalp seen in the mirror should be cut off from what shows up above according to what was mentioned in Al-Thālīth; either treatment it until recovery.
"Chapter 74.
"In the lower chancre presented in the groin.
"The groin may present many types of tumors such as cancer, encapsulated tumor, ulcers, cysts, abscesses, carbuncles, gangrene, boils and fistulas, and al-Thālīth; all these diseases and their kinds and signs have been mentioned in the division.
It was proper to mention in this chapter the heated tumor that is located on the liver, if it is one of those types that contracts at length with iron, then it should be noted that its pain initially was severe with swelling and inflammamoins.
I saw it as red if touched and do not hurry to fill or treat it until the completion of symptoms, then it is proper for the woman to sit on a chair with two seats, leaning forward on her chest.
Her male parts gather to the lower abdomen, and her thighs are spread apart, with her arms under her knees connected by straps that fix them in place.
Therefore, the woman sits on her right side and uses the instrument that opens with it the vaginal orifice as it appears in later images, and if one desires to use this instrument, it should be appreciated for digging deeper into the woman's womb so that nothing from the instrument enters more than the depth of the vagina.
In the case of illness, since the instrument is deeper than usual, it was proper to place a wedge on the edge of the neck of the womb to prevent the entire instrument from entering deep into the vagina and for the cord to be placed in the device from the upper side.
You hold the instrument and manage the lupa until you open up to the neck of the womb; if pus appears and touches your hand, it was soft and smooth and should be scraped at its head with a wide blade when the tube is emptied completely.
It was desirable that the thread be soft and embedded in rose oil or green ointhem with a pinch, and the thread should come out of the incision at the neck of the womb and from outside on the uterus and on the thighs, pure cotton soaked in hot water.
Then treat it with the bandage that heals for two days until it is cured.
And he washed the womb and wound with water mixed with honey, then with hot water boiled in it or a long string, then returned to the bandage; the discharge is still internally within the uterus.
It was desirable that it be refrained from treating with iron but treated as we mentioned in the section on fractures.
Chapter Five and Seventy-Six. (This translates to a chapter number rather than an excerpt, so no further translation is needed.)
In teaching recipes, how do living beeings treat if they come out abnormally? (This transl. seems to refer to a metapeborical or allegorical way of describing surgical procedures in ancient texts; as such no further translation is provided here.)
It is necessary for the examiner to first know the natural childbirth form from its signs if a woman starts to tremble, longs to pant and foam at the mouth, spitting out what she has in her throat.
He should hasten the birth knowing that it is natural and the child's head along with the membrane or a part of its secretion, if these signs are seen, one should press her abdomen to help the baby come out quickly.
If it drops its head and the membrane with it is washed away properly, this birth is not natural because the baby may come out on its legs and hands before its head and arms.
A single hand or leg emerges, or the head and a limb come out, or it comes out with a twist towards the shoulders; the examiner should be skilled in all these matters as well as avoiding missteps and errors.
I will indicate each form and how to adapt in it, deduce from that and respond accordingly if the baby comes out naturally on top of its head causing agony to the woman and difficulty with delivery; and if I observe her strength has waned, she sits on a chair while instructing other women.
He moistened it with a cooked decoction and wet spits, then he inserted between his fingers a small hook-like instrument to tear or extract the membrane until what was inside (the fetus) became loose and fell out of the woman's womb.
If the fetus did not come out after the woman drank a decoction of honeyed butter and was instructnented to dance, sneeze with a conch shell and grasp her mouth and nose, then the infant will emerge from his hour of labor; she should gently pull them both out.
If the woman did not enter labor while standing on a platform and lifting her legs up, then shaking the platform with her legs touching the ground, and holding onto a pole until she started to tremble, if her hands do not enter (the birth canal) then only cut off and pull out whatever remains of the infant.
Or tie the hands with a rope and pull them up gently, as they come out; if the infant comes out on his legs, then push him upwards slightly, turn him a little until he straightens out, then take one of his legs and stretch it slightly.
If the offspring come out through both thighs, he ordered her to ejaculate with a clyssus and it exits; but if it does not exit as described by us then only a small portion of the fetus comes out until it takes on its natural form, at which point it exits smoothly, just as we have described.
Thigh from the eyelids, saliva and mucus of the pharynx, dissolved milk fat and semen are beaten together in a mortar vigorcuously then poured into the vagina, inserted below the woman's belly then sit her in a fomentation bath until labor is reached.
If you see that he has inserted a stick below her, and she holds it for an hour; if the stick grabs hold of something then sit her on a chair, sperm is ejaculated onto her vagina, mouth and nose are plugged and gently press downwards on her belly, in one hour the fetus exits from its head, with legs and arms.
If it exits in this manner, slightly grasp its arms with your hands then the woman sits up on her knees and lowers herself down to lie completely flat while embracing his arms and lightly presses on her belly. Then he extracted everything under his legs from the afterbirth until it was lowered down; if the fetus did not exit with her entire limbs, shake them vigorously and press lightly over the forceps a little so that the child rises up, then gently place the assistant's hand on the fetus and slightly lift it.
The woman was instructed to dance until the child was born; if the baby is partially delivered with one of her hands, gently take hold of it with your hand, and make her walk on foot if she cannot manage that, then if she cannot walk, let her sit down.
Her bed was shaken vigor^rously, her legs were shook^r, then the lubricant described as "saplings" was used by the man who freed her to seat her on a chair, and he gently corrected the baby's position naturally and gave water for drinking to the woman and instructed her to dance until birth.
The baby is partially delivered with both hands, turning its face towards the mother's chest; it should be held gently by the assistant's hand then slightly turned and smoothed if there was a swelling on before as described of fats or lubricants.
Then she began to move a little and if she did, he sat her on the chair and instructed her to lean to the right side; then let her sneeze with a spatula, from which the fetus would exit, leaving the child standing next to it.
If the fetus were pulled into the birth canal with a forceps, grasp it by its legs until completely expelled from moisture; then on the baby's face and neck cut off to prevent asphyxiation, pushing the infant back in until properly positioned inside.
The woman was instructed to sneeze repeatedly, and twins or triplets often exit easily; know that twins are very common and can produce three or four at a time but they usually live only briefly as it is abnormal for five (children).
They are surrounded and if multiple amniotic sacs were present, they separate by a natural barrier between them each being tied at the neck, exiting as an individual baby would normally and easily with acceptable delivery as we described.
Indeed, some of them suffer at birth from what we have mentioned as unnatural forms; treat it as we described, and let it be mild and do what you can with ease, and be able to adapt to any form that seems possible through the applicable method for safety.
He mentions what is imagined in the womb from beings that fall, one or two or three or four or five or six or seven and more than ten, he says it was correct when a woman fell pregnant with seven and others with fifteen all of them conceived.
With the appreciation of the wise man, all this should be known in the field of readiness so that it may one day meet as such and interact accordingly,
The sixth and seventy chapter.
In the expulsion of a deceased fetus.
If the deceased fetus is treated as described in sectional treatment and does not expel, compelling circumstances necessitate manual intervention. It should be considered that the woman was strong and did not have any of the symptoms fearful of harm from it; she should be lifted onto a bed with her chest elevated.
His head is tilted downward, his legs are raised twice, and the assistant adjusts him from both sides or attaches him to the bed so that his body does not drift during childbirth.
Then he moistens her vagina with wet pads containing breast milk, colostrum, and mare's urine; she greases her fingers with these substances and inserts them into the womb gently before requesting a place for the expulsion of the placenta after childbirth.
It seems that the fetus is coming to descend placentas through its eyes, forehead, mouth, cheeks, under its chin, neck or near the sides of its body or beneath the armpits.
If it descends onto its feet and middle of thighs, the midwife should hold the placenta with her right hand and twist it between her left thumb and index finger gently, then insert a finger into the relevant position that we mentioned earlier to aid in expulsion.
Once it reaches a vacant space, another or third placenta is expelled by the midwife if necessary for balanced pull and not tilting towards any side; she should gradually extend the pulling force evenly without making the tug abrupt but rather toward all directions.
It is not difficult to extract as done with a hammer when removing the nail, and between that it should be shaken; from which side it should be oiled by some fingers dipped in oil to insert them into it to control what has been extracted so that part of the fetus can be moved to the positions of the crane's bones.
Raise it a little until the fetus comes out completely, then its hand came out before the rest and could not be pushed back due to pressure so it should break open and pull until everything is out.
Either in the palm joint or wrist, so it should be done with the other hand and both legs; as the fetus' head was large and its exposure pressured to come out, or there was fluid in its skull which required inserting something sharp between the fingers.
It would make the head extract the water or crush it with a device called an instrument of crushing that comes with images of all the devices in this doorway.
Similarly, if the fetus had a large head as mentioned before, it should be extracted from the skull or crushed with an instrument of crushing and then all bones come out completely; the head comes out and presses during pushing so that moisture accumulates in the chest.
Then, if the chest is not joined and does not protrude for exiting, cut a piece that you can on it, either below the abdamo or adhered with pitch so that moisture may seep out of it.
If the fetus is on his leg, then pulling and extracting it to the womb should be easy; so pressing at the abdomen or chest should pull it with a hook that you wrapped around your hand and shaved the abdomen or chest until it slips out of them.
The external parts were pulled out and the head recoiled, securing the eligible left hand in it; if the womb was open mouthed, enter the right hand into its neck and grab the head with it and pull it towards the mouth of the womb then insert a spatula or two into it and pull with them,.
If the mouth of the ward was partially closed with a red swelling, then it should not be forced but at that time use moist and fatty substances to soften them and sit in water where things ferment and rot.
As for if the fetus is adjacent, one may attempt what we mentioned in the living fetus case; however, this cannot be done by cutting a piece and exiting it. One should ensure that no part of the tissue remains inside the ballot. If your treatment fails, then proceed with what we mentioned regarding treatment for hot tumors present in the uterus.
The presentation of bleeding through the filter in the water tank and performing the complete treatment, a woman was seen who had tied her fetus's mouth again after removing it once.
Then the other fetus also showed signs after a long time, had a tumor underneath her and swelled until it burst open causing the pus to ooze out, which she then applied for treatment on it. She used strong magnets over an extended period without healing the wound or using any bandages.
He went to the stage of bone, then another day passed with him reaching the stage of other bones, and her belly was in a position without any bone present at that time. She assessed that she had been from dead fetus bones; when examining the wound, many skull bones came out from it.
Albucasis then followed until the woman was taken out with many bones, in the best of her condition, and she lived like this for a period extending to the ground that is hardening and walking, but only now have these rare cases come here.
For it is the knowledge and aid that the surgeon attempts with his hand in treatment,
Chapter seventy-seven.
It contains images of the instruments required for expelling the fetus.
Image of a lamb opening its mouth to showcase the womb's entrance.
This forceps described in the books, whether it is made of two pieces of wood except that this lamb should be gentle as a forceps and either ivory or boxwood, with each piece's breadth being finger-width.
Their shape leans toward two fingers in length, half a finger wide, from the same type of wood, having thickened on them to be about one or slightly more than a finger long and their width approximately that of two fingers.
They are the two that enter into the womb to open with them at your lamb handling, an image of another gentle and delicate instrument like this.
Crafted from cedar or boxwood in the shape of claws, each extremity has two points at its end, with the length of each point resembling a finger and their width that of a fingertnail if one wishes to open the womb using them.
The woman sat on a reclining chair with her legs spread apart, then inserted the two crooked tools into her vagina and grasped one end of them between her thighs; she opened the tool like the claws and proceeded as much as desired to widen the uterus. Until you craft what you desire, another image of a lamb as described by the early ones.
Image of the instrument that propels the fetus.
Image of the rod used to dilate the head of the fetus.
The forceps resembles scissors with teeth at the end, and one could craft a rectangular shape like claws on this image as seen here with teeth resembling those of shears that cut and sever.
Image of another instrument.
Image of a scalpel.
This scalpel has a slight thickness so that it does not break when attracting the fetus with it, image of a scalpel with two sharp ends.
Images of two large instruments for cesareamen:
All these tools of various kinds were commonly used and made the craftsman's work faster, and he gained fame among people for their utility; do not despise having such a tool as an essential necessity with you:
Chapter Eighty-Seven.
In the discharge of urine.
If the urinary tract is obstructed after passing stool, it should be commanded to tighten itself and then ejaculate through a catheter while holding your hand on its mouth and squeezing. After this, the excretion passed out with it; otherwise, take enough of something.
And make a hole in the cover, insert an opened herb like fodder, sage, and saffron, shibit, pomegnion, asafoetida, cassia seed or some of these; steep them all in water and heat on fire then place a silver tube on the hole in the cover and the other end into the rectum:
And hold it until the steam reaches the rectum's bottom then ejaculate as we said; the urinary tract will quickly excrete, and after this treatment if there is any residue command the left hand to be immersed in a cleansing cream or eye drops:
Then he inserts it in advance and examines with the syrinx if it has been grabbed and slightly extends it until it comes out, being attached to a depth of the heart; then put one's hand as we described until if found the syrinx attracting it slightly towards compassion.
Not to fall of the heart when strongly attracted but rather be moved gently towards right and left, then increasingly attraction, it responds while being released from attachment; the tongue of the heart was described as healed with plastering and treatment of fortitude and herbs.
It did not exit with all that we described, but the anger towards it in attempting to re-attract, yet should be connected what has come out of her back to the woman's thigh and injected by a quadruple plaster; then it is bandaged for days.
It is resolved and exits only if it has putrefied, spreading its foul odor to the stomach and head, aggravating that illness; it should use consenting smoke.
Therefore, some tried devices smoking the pipe and dried grapes, a machine that causes vaporization for the woman during menstruation and menopause:
It is made from lead-like bullets or forged from brass, placing the fine end in front and the wide end on the fire; it emits a fragrance over the charcoal that one holds until it is gone and then repeats this process again.
The Ninth Hundredths chapter.
In the treatment of non-fractured ankles.
Many young men may experience unset fractures in their ankles, where a fine splint may be needed to allow them to press it with their fingers; otherwise, they should securely pinch the area using a sharp object and caution against muscle strain.
Then, cover it with a soaked cloth in wine and oil and treat it using bandages until healed; there is fear that the splint may become lodged inside the wound leading to a needle-like tube causing prolonged discharge when desired by the child.
Also, treating the swelling from a wound or inflammation involves extracting that pus and then following the treatment methods previously mentioned in healing and compression as discussed earlier.
Chapter cuatrocientos ochenta y ocho.
In the treatment of hernias occurramoeba that occur in the lower area.
Hernias that occur in the lower area is a complex condition happening near or from the vicinity of the hip joint and can be one or more hernias.
If that complex condition is delayed and leaks, a thin white or powdery fluid may come out from these hernias into the abdomen and to the peritoneal cavity, which are not internalized, sepsis can be identified by leakage of pus and gas when using the inflated method.
And sometimes may come out of them worms, if they are internalized into the abdominal cavity and towards the ureteric lumen, there could be internalization to the femoral canal and towards the inguinal ring, which is also known as herniation towards the hip joint from non-internalization.
Use your index finger to enter the hip joint and insert a thin needle into the hernia if it is not internally incarcerated, or use steel wire if there are no hooks; then if there were internal strangulation, insert a thin needle from a fine glass thread or horsehair.
Until you feel the cauterization or sensation in your finger, if there is no pain and nothing oozes from the hole nor odor or pus as we have said then be assured it is not infected.
If the strangulated stone extends to the bladaderetention of urine from itand its abstinence from being cauterized at the site with medicines, and if it is directed towards the thigh muscle or the tailbone, indicate the incision reaching there.
If there is no bone cure extending towards the side and pain in that direction, nor does pus always ooze from it and treatment does not heal, and these directed points are all not infected with a puss pocket.
And if treatment is futile for those who try it from the unskilled doctors, and that which is not directed and chronic to her with an iron cure as I have described and what you may have tried, then let the disease worsen in your hands on its backside.
And his leg rises up and extends towards the stomach then cauterizing wire or iron enters if in the strangulated stone until you know where the cauterizing ends is that I feel sickness to the seat should be with your prick finger at the seat.
I felt in your pinched finger that you have performed it yourself, and without feeling between your fingers or near it with a blunt knife or hammer, so we are certain that it is not infected, for there is no risk from it as we said.
They said that it cures in some people during an epidemic, and as a requested treatment to apply a fine powder on the nose according to the size of the nostril, which is introduced with a spoon into the nostril until it reaches near the seat then returned twice or thrice.
Until you realize that all those excessive swolled meats resembling a bird's feather pluck have been burnt, then treat them with boiled fat until they come out, and the meats that were burned are treated with sore plasters, thus it is healed.
Otherwise, it is not healed by anything other than treatment, and if you insert the pin between your finger in the seat and there being a thick barrier of meat or blunt knife, I saw the nostril come out from under the skin then the skin was torn off at first nasal. You pass through the incision with the probe, which is at the thigh until the incision reaches its end and the probe is released and falls out; then you cleanse those dressed meats that resemble a bird's feather pipe, nothing remaining of it.
Then treat it with a tourniquet until he recovers, for your bleeding and condition between you and your work are severed from those meats which make the best and quickest benefit in fire or sharp drugs because I've noticed that by using fire, two conditions improve: burning removes excess meat.
Cut the bleeding and dry up the moisture, then treat it with lard or ground sulfur mixed with oil until the place heals and those burnt meats come out in scabs; at that time, treat the wound with a tourniquet made from hard ham.
And those medicines that cause stopping and drying, if it has healed and is not to be feared of returning, the thigh was finished reaching into the cleft and after being outside the body, insert your finger in the cleft and search with it.
I felt the stitching and between it a curtain of silk or leather, which was close to invisibility. There was no work done on it except for the desire and request that one of three methods be used as we said.
Alternatively, it should be incised until its depth is sufficient to insert the pincers and treat near it so that it does not extend far with stitching, lest it cut through the surrounding muscle at the socket causing an unwanted leakage of fluid as we discussed, then treated accordingly.
Or execute the curtain as we said, either by stitching or another sharp-edged tool then cleanse all meat within the incision to where it can be reached through palpation.
Then fill the wound entirely with stitching and upper lip up to completion so that the nasal passage remains open within the socket, which will be less visible on the patient, and may close over time.
If the stitching is inserted into the nasal passage near the edge of the socket adjacent to the cheek skin and around the socket, then a sharp-pointed stitch should be used like an esker on this image:.
Insert a cord or something similar with five strands and then insert the pin through the nasal bridge until it reaches the depth, which will be perforating from the edge of the seat near inside.
Extract the cord from that puncture, so that your finger goes into the seat and extract one end of the cord; gather both ends and pull tightly, leave it for a day or two; as you cut the cord in the flesh, tighten it well enough until those meats between the cord's ends tear and fall off, then treat the wound until healed and recovered.
If the nasal cavity perforation was not made deep enough so that you can've done it for muscle, don't do that to prevent tearing it, then make one as we mentioned until healed and recovered.
The image of the hook used to pierce nostrils should have a sharp enough tip and the other end not too sharp so as not to cut through it where there is no need as you see.
Sharp eight. (This could be referring to either "sharpness level" or a type of instrument, depending on the full context.)
In the case of abscesses where blood is oozing and cutting them, treating the fistulae.
Abscesses are either inside the joint resembling red blisters or like grapes, and there are small and large ones with blood constantly oozing from them.
One is large and located outside the joint with protrusions, but those that are mostly external to the joint also have less moisture oozing from them, often clear water or a little blood continuously, and they appear on skin color.
The treatment for internal abscesses is to let the swelling subside and rise until it exits from the joint, exposing the yoke. Then immediately attach it with pincers or tie it with a toe and cut it off when you have grasped it; if restrained by pincers, prevent moisture and allow drying.
Split it with a large incision or cut out with sterilized lamb skin, then cut and sprinkle it after cutting with fine powders; the joint cap or varnish is applied to what will be brought in through its gate.
Then he was treated with all the therapy until recovery; since the seat did not permit leaving later in the disease, it inserted a needle into it for a short while to wash and cleanse what is in the seat so that it could exit quickly when the disease is fading, then the external support outside the seat ordered this easy thing.
It is for you to take it by force or hang it with a hook and cut it then treat it as we mentioned until recovery; since he disliked cutting with iron in this case, one should use his string on the thread (referring to the ligature technique) by inserting it into the needle.
Then pull the thread to above and insert it with a needle at its base from another side, damaging both ends of the string below the needle, making them tense and tight, then knotting the string and extracting the needle; do this with all threads and leave one that does not tear.
To drain blood from it, then place a soaked cloth in rose water or onion juice and put it on the seat and order the disease to rest until it falls; if the threads fall, treat them with bandages and all therapy until recovery.
As for the treatment of clefts, it is often presented from pigments and arrestation of formation if chronic, and if medicine does not succeed in treating it, then one should scrape it with a scalpel or a forceps until it becomes moist and the top layer that prevents it dissolves.
Then it is treated until it seals properly, and if it does not close initially with the suture, then strengthen it more than the first time until it heals completely and exfoliates; then treat it as it will recover, heal.
The Second Chapter Eight.
In the treatment of inverted and non-inverted clefts, as well as dry warts and insect bites.
The nail is indeed a curved attachment to the body's skin resembling the head of a nail and found throughout the body, especially prevalent in the heels and fingertnails, often presenting as pain upon walking.
It is recommended to scrape around the nail and grasp with a file or emery board, then remove from its base before treating it, depending on what presents at its doorway; as for dry warts, one of them is a small rough nodule that protrudes over the skin's surface.
Often, in the hands of boys, to treat it so that it expands and is cut or perforated with a thread of silk or hair until it falls out; if you wish, burn it on something brought forth by fire or a strong medicine.
The inverted and non-invertamolette used for treating the mole, as I remember it; similarly, the mole was also a small lump covered in thick flesh on the body's surface going deep into it, and if it caught cold I felt something like an ant nest.
The body would be there and more in the hands, to treat it so that a tube is taken from an ostrich's or eagle's feather and placed into the mole until the hole forms around the tube on all sides and you hold the tube with your hand until you scrape around the mole.
It would rise deep in the muscle and the mole would be lifted from its source, if you wish to do so with a copper tube or iron on this image:.
The upper part of the tube should be soft and clenched to make it easy for fingers to adjust and pull, if you wish to sew the mole onto what is provided in the hollow needle on this hole:,.

In the images of instruments used for injecting in cases of hemorrhoids, fistulas, and hernias.
The injector may be made of silver, brass or tin-glazed brass, or forged and whether small or large, is manufactured according to the needs of those who use it. The ones used for treating small children or those with narrow anuses, their injectors are of a very gentle nature - image of a large injector:.
The top part that holds the nozzle is wide for this feature and has a barrier where the noeud attaches as you see, and the lower end that enters the anus is very subtly tapered to one side with two holes on one side and one hole on the other.
The hole is slightly wider than the shaft or a little thicker, and the tube in which you put medicine (from an animal bladder or from bezoar powder) resembles a small wine carafe with its diameter in hand spans.
Another hole is drilled at a distance of finger-width from the first, and then passes through this second hole with a tight cord made of twisted fibers (about ten strands or so), which gather the tube like a carafe. If the drug is placed in such a way that it binds tightly between the two bones and then inserted, this is an image of the drill hole and puncture:
How to ensure it fills the sac or bladebelly with the drug so that on a stove, the likelihood of infection is minimized and be careful not to be too hot or too cold then the disease will settle on its back and spread upwards into its legs:
It places under it a pad or cloth then moistens the end of the inserted with ointment or egg yolk or millet dough and similar substances, then enters into the socket gently, then takes the drill bit by hand and squeezes it firmly until everything in the insertion comes out through the pouch.
Then he removes the insertion and allows the disease to drain down his leg until it reaches the wall, if stimulated by the drug to leave as much as possible may rest on it all night and then report in the morning for stooling with a purgative, so that inserted into colon channels will make haste to exit thus emptying the channel until he is relieved:
It was in the socket with a cyst or painful tumor, so that the inserted should be very gentle from those who insert it with boys, and this is an image of a gentle drill bit pressed against his skin:
Chapter Four and Eighty.
In the Treatments of Surgery.
I have mentioned in the section on treating what is known as 'kitties' and now I recall that they are treated by hand and with medication, bringing them to a state of recovery; therefore, surgeries differ according to whatever it is upon which surgery is performed and depending on where the wound is located.
Things upon which surgeratur have a lot in common with stone, knife fragment or blade or spear point and so forth to that kind of things many.
And regarding surgeries as for the location on the body, a wound that is found upon head or neck and so forth to such parts of the body like liver.
And I describe treatments for some surgeries to make them a standard and law upon most of the surgeries, and I begin with simple head surgery because the narrator will mention it in chapters three to five of this book.
I say that when a simple head wound occurs and it is not a fracture of the bone but rather like breaking stone or so forth, and has just broken skin only, and the wound is large and feared to develop cancerous tumor onset prompted me to remove hair follicle atop. Do not delay and let the blood out to its full strength, if it does not prevent hemorrhage; particularly when the blood from the wound is flowing slowly, so that hemorrhaging occurs against the wounded side.
Prevent the patient from overeating, drinking alcohol, and consuming heavy foods; to prevent hemorrhaging, reduce food intake and consume more meat while avoiding alcoholic beverebut if a rash occurs on the wound use a mixture of melted cotton soaked in rose oil or with vinegar-based drink.
And if the rash on the wound is red with blood and has not changed after I described to you a little while ago, but if it has been altered by some clothing touching it.
Continue applying a plaster until it heals, if the wound is large and seems like cut from a sword or similar, do not gather the edges with thread as I described in suturing the abdomen; instead join them using surgical technique.
If the skin was a bone graft and attached without sutures, then treat the ward using forceful meat-based medications to replace the skin and instruct the patient to consume foods as tough as tendons or cartilage etc.
In the skin, a putrefaction occurs and does not adhere to the bone but cut off all of it swell with it then treat it; in these surgereban arteries or veins bleeding from them and the blood did not stop by drugs search on the vessels.
It did not coagulate with the ligament and bind it, if necessary as we mentioned but did not work until the blood stops; these were small simple surgeries easily commanded to heal by treating them so that they stop bleeding.
Before it is changed by the air, recipe for theriac to take from milk two parts and from cheese two parts and three parts of smoked or unsmoked fat all grind and filter it onto the wound and binds well until a good scab forms.
Blood flows then it is pressed from above with ointment and left to not heal until the drug stops working; it may do so on its own if only fat was used without milk or cheese.
He also performs this act with both eyes in many major surgeries if he properly places them, tightens them, and the surgery is easy to bleed from their blood so that the air has not changed it; but if the air has made some change and especially during the summer time.
In this position, it is not effective that he mentioned wearing some matured armors or carrying a powdered mustard made of water and honey until the swelling extends then treat it with all remedies until it heals completely.
As for if the injury involves a skull fracture and it is moving towards the eye socket, he mentioned treating head fractures in what follows, in throat surgery, an injury to the neck does not differ much from the treatment of a simple head injury.
But if he cut a nerve or artery from the throat, it is not an escape that does not prevent treatment by applying a tight grip as with a zanjera and compression to avoid further damaging the nerve and constricting it.
He does not place anything cold on the wound because the nerve essence is cold and connected to the brain, which is the highest of the organs, and what he treats it with from mild medicines includes soaked lupine water in lukewarm water, or rose oil, or mulberry juice.
If he also washed it with lukewamen water and metal stones, and if the wound is large, he used a needle or sutured it with resin paste then treated until it healed.
If the wound was deep and a lump formed in it, with pus accumulating at its lowest point within it, then it may have been severed from the vessel in the injury and stopped bleeding. To address this, one might need to connect or compress it depending on necessity.
If the wound had cut some of the intestinal folds or all, and the bowels were pulled by suturing the skin on the colon's edges with a needle without touching it but rather its color restored naturally then bound firmly and left for several days.
Then he treated it with the bandage in which pressure and drying were applied until recovery; the wound had affected the bone, upon probing there were bone fragments, all of which could be removed or as much as possible, and some that could not be extracted until the wound healed, closed up, and breathing eased.
The wound had healed, and the pains we described in it have subsided; treating it according to what is mentioned on its label, in chest surgery and between the shoulders.
The incision was made with a spear or knife, and I noticed it had an opening through which air would escape if the patient breathed; recognizing this as a mortal wound, there were no signs of healing at all, nor blood flow to prevent infection from entering initially or later without hemostasis.
The patient was brought in dead but made an appealing bandage and changed it twice during the day, so that he did not bring a bandage into his mouth to make a linen plug for suctioning moisture from the wound to help the patient sleep on the wound.
Not everything gathered, even if it has been three days or more since the injury and there was no convulsion, heart palpitaturessymptoms of breathlessness, or signs that the patient's condition is improving; then I knew the wound was healed through treatment with fomentation and other therapies until recovery.
He had a persistent fever and continuous effusion; I knew he was suffering from an injury to the chest or abdomen, which required treatment through suturing.
Whether it was large or small, if it had affected the bone and removed pieces of it during surgery, I immediately stopped bleeding from those shards; If they were not contaminated, then healed them completely.
If the wound heals, it facilitates drainage; as for surgeries involving body parts, one should consider their treatment according to what we have mentioned.
The Fifth and Eight Chapters.
Surgery on the abdum, exiting of a pouch, and suturing it.
The tear that exposes the abdum may be large, small, or moderate; if it results in a pouch exiting or multiple pouches, its insertion and suturing will vary in difficulty.
In small tears as well, it may also be difficult due to an obstruction from another related vein for the response to be more severe and if the opening did not promptly reach its place within a minute, it became worse with entry into this becoming better than average tearing because it does not cause such a response of the channel.
Be aware that two of the four surgical needles make a difference in abdominal and surface body surger cuing while the other two specialized needles are for deeper body surgeries, but they mainly excel at laparoscopic surgeries.
I will explain it to you one by one with a description and statement, if the wound is small and something from the channel has come out causing an obstruction of the response then this would be for either minor tearing as we said or due to the channel's being exposed earlier inhaling air.
If that's the case, it was necessary to warm up so as to submerge a sponge or moist tear in plain water alone or cooked ehird and saffron with it allowing the channel to swell until the air pocket is resolved.
He who makes a potion in which there is grip, it is better than water alone for relieving flatulence; if one sees that the flatulence has dissolved with the pouch and in hot water mixed with honey or bakery flour, then by introducing it into the left side of the chest they will seek to alleeb.
It is difficult to obtain relief after this treatment, and he may find a small rupture with the device that uses needles for incisions or the first treatment if possible; then one must incise if necessary due to failure of other methods, here's an image of the device:.
Her one open side is limited, the other side is unlimited, and the thin edge is not a blunt instrument but rather a small flat like a small saw as you see if the wound extends into the pouch it should heal in its natural form:.
His special place if he can do so is best, and if the rupture is wide and located in the lower abdabid to make the patient lie on their back and raise their legs higher than the head and if it's at the upper abdabid then raise his head and chest from below:.
Also, if the tear is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, make your intent and purpose always be on the side where surgery raises from the other, thus it should be operated on in major surgeries and intermediate ones.
As for minor surgeries, place it according to what you can manage, then have a servant grab the tear with both hands and bring the edges together before handing it over to someone skilled in sewing.
This is the general sewing feature where you take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound and leave it from one side of the tear up to the thickness of the thread then insert a single needle without letting the thread enter into its edges on the skin. With the margins under the skin from within the cavity that have been brought up on that side and gathered edges of the skin and sutures, thus becoming four folds, then clamp with a double thread around the needle several times until all edges of the wound are firmly approximated.
Then leave a layer of skin thickness and insert another needebut instead, clamp with the thread as you did with the first needle until all needs are completed according to what is needed for them from the number of stitches so that the wound cavity empties completely and the suture remains evenly between the thicker and smoother.
Because the thin nail cuts the meat and also making entry into the skin difficult, it is proper that there be both fineness in the nail and thickness; it is not proper for the nail to protrude near the edge of the skin.
So that the meat is not cut too quickly and the wound does not open before healing, also to avoid difficulty with suturing; so that the wound does not prevent from knitting together, then the nail edges will be torn; so as not to harm the patient during sleep or cause a deep tear on either side of the grip.
This type of suturing with nails is thus suitable for small surgical incisions because it may be completed by using a single or two nails, approximately so.
The second characteristic of suturing with needles is that it brings together four edges of the skin and the fascia in one pass using a nail holding an intermediate thread, which is both fine and thick; if these four edges are sewn with this type of nail, then replicate the same pattern from where they began.
The suturing thread is fastened from the top of the wound to allow for stitching according to the type of thread that the barber pulls with and which makes between each stitch and the next after the thin edge of the finger, this thread is known by everyone.
With this thread, the surgery of a man's abdamen was stitched who had been cut with scissors and the surgeon's incision exceeded a span, extending about two spans from the middle cavity outward. The tear was in the center of the abdomen.
He was kept separate after having elevated the wound from the surgery for forty-two hours, and healed towards fifteen days, and it was treated until healing, then lived afterwards many years behaving in all his affairs, and the doctors ruled over him that it did not cause lethargy.
And it was amazing that I did not treat him with medication because there was nothing of medicine at the time, so I put two layers of beeswax on the wound and instructed to bathe him in honey water until healing.
Regarding one of the two types of threads mentioned, he is referred to in Galen's speech that "initiate stitching from the skin and insert needles from outside to inside; if the needle penetrates the skin and into the muscle moving towards the abdomen." (Please note: This last translation may require further context or correction for accuracy, as ancient texts can be complex.)
The needle was left in the fold where it was inserted and the needle was passed from the opposite side of the incision into the other fold from inside to outside, if it had been passed out, then a second pass was made through the same fold from inside to outside.
Let the fold on this side where you inserted the needle and passed it through the opposite side from inside to outside, insert with its pass into the fold leading to the incision until all of them are done.
Then begin also from this side with its edge and incision through the fold on the other side, remove the needle from the skin near it then return it to that skin and cut along the fold of the gutter on the other side with this gutter.
Then remove it from the skin at its side, do that again and do it afterwards twice more so that all of the suturing is done as in this example, and describe this stitching to be consistent with the technique used by surgeons for closure.
The gutter stitch is made once from one side with the skin edge and left on the other side until emptied, as also mentioned by Galen in his speeches about this specific type of suturing technique.
This is as if one would make the same cut that artisans do, so they gather each part to its corresponding problematic spot and pour the bile duct into another bile duct, which indeed as you described.
It is necessary that the needle be inserted into a nearby part of the gallbladder from outside and then passed entirely through it, followed by withdrawing the needle and passing it from inside to another part of the gallbladder, both ways, and then retracting it as well.
It is done from inside to outside in another part of the gallbladder on the opposite side, this type of suturing is better than simple easy suturing and which brings forward, these are words by Galenus, and it was said that some had chest surgery using two needles. That is to insert one thread and start inserting the needle from where you are, passing it to the other side, and then insert another needle from the opposite side as it has here for suturing the chambers accordingly.
Know that if the rupture is in the middle of the abdebut its suture will be more difficult than those in other parts of the abdomen, and as for sewing the wound, it is decided likewise with others by surgery but this is only if you realize the bleeding thoroughly before it changes due to air, inflate the pouch, cut it, and clamp it while on a stretcher.
It seemed that the wound had changed due to some equipment you brought until it bled, and the stitches fell out while the gut was leaking and oozing pus, then treat as usual with other surgeries until healed.
If you have not brought medicines since it started leaking yellowish watery pus and changing twice a day as I instructed until healed then you do not need further treatment in most cases if the surgerries are simple, but beware of involving main organs causing pain in the wound.
It should be submerged in lukewarm oil or rose fat and placed around the areas between the ribs and the belly, as I feel that it will often show pain or suppuration near there with a tight black syrup.
Particularly when the pitch has reached in the bag and become a slit wound inside, know that what is from thick intestines is easier to heal and what is from thin ones is more difficult to heal.
As for the pouch known as the fasting bag, it does not heal from a wound that is in it due to its abundance of veins and bones and tendon sheaths and proximity to nerve nature, while if what protrudes from the puncture wound is a threaded part and you realize it intact on your pouch, then.
It has healed a while and turned green or black; it should be pulled off at the place where it turns black to avoid bleeding from the puncture, as there are veins and blood vessels in the thorns so that they break without ties.
And make the two ends of the thread hanging below the wound outside to facilitate pulling and extracting it when the thorn falls, as mentioned in the condition of the bag wound, but if there is a tear on the pouch which is small.
If someone is stabbed in the abdatur, and the wound is on the right side of the organ, it becomes acute. Pus and foul-smelling air emerge from it; thus I treated him so that he did not die. I did not let him go until he was fully recovered and the injury location had healed, as when I saw that the injury had healed, I feared an accident would happen inside of it; so I prevented such an occurrence from happening to him, and his condition remained in better state. He eats, drinks, defecates, and uses the bathroom regularly for his duties; some of my associates have mentioned that there was an occasion where he had a small wound in the scrotum which should be treated accordingly with this symptom.
It is that he takes the large ants' heads, gathers their saliva on the wound, and places another ant there with its mouth open; if it clings to it, tightening its jaws, then a different ant will be placed near the first one.
She continues to do so with several anangs on the wound, then releases it and wraps the wound; those heads stay attached in the scrotum until the swelling subsides and heals without causing any further damage or using a fine thread for wrapping.
The one who slides the animal tied to a cord after it has been inserted into the arrow and takes this cord from the core, then ties it with a fine silk thread, which is then entered through the arrow. In it, the cord is tied around the container and then pulled into the socket; this type of stitching with silk thread and linen is only for bribery and gambling purposes.
If the tear is large and wide, especially if it's in one of the smaller orifices, then there is no way to repair it, nor any hope for a successful outcome.
Chapter Six Hundred Eighty-Nine.
In the treatment of diphtheria and elephantiasis.
Know that any wound or ulcer, if it becomes chronic and advanced, has not been healed by cauterization and constantly spreads pus without breaking open on its own in any part of the body, is known as elephantiasis (elephantiasis) and diphtheria.
It is indeed a complex, hard-to-reach whiteness with no pain associated to it that resembles the hollow of a bird's chest.
Therefore, some call it wool, and sometimes the dampness is always thickened lime while at times the humidity may have ceased, and this moisture can be abundant or scanty, coarse or fine, and dense or delicate.
In the chapter on surgery, Albucasis stated that none of these sores heal or cause meat to grow within them, for there are nine reasons, one being due to lack of blood in the body, another due to inflammation, and another because of hard tissue inside it and along its edges preventing good meat growth. Or it may be due to its being dirty and smelly, or because the sore itself is infected with poor-quality tissue, or perhaps the drug used for treatment is unsuitable, or maybe due to a type of gangrene present in the intestines from the genus Vibrio, or perhaps an intrinsic defect within the abdamen.
Or it may be due to its being dirty and smelly, or because the sore itself is infected with poor-quality tissue, or perhaps the drug used for treatment is unsuitable, or maybe due to a type of gangrene present in the intestines from the genus Vibrio, or perhaps an intrinsic defect within the abdamen. Furthermore, in the city of Serescia where diseases mature and tumor growth naturally slows down, or perhaps due to one bone or several, Albucasis detailed all these causes and their signs as well as treatments with medications in this section.
It is necessary for me to inform you about the treatment of stranguria and the zokam that is done manually, know that stranguria can occur in all parts of the body, from which it ends up in large veins or nerves.
It may end up in a cavity or a sac, or into the bladastery or the side of an elbow, or into a bone shaft or into a rib from ribs on the back or into a joint with closely connected parts such as the hand and foot, eventually approaching a limb's main organ.
These were stranguria cases of this type, which suffered from incurable and difficult-to-settle infectious diseases, so it was stranguria that did not reach the mentioned locations that I have stated, hoped for, and wished to treat them.
I wanted to know this, so take a syringe made of bronze or iron if the stranguria is going along its entire length, then in the stranguria there was an injection with a needle from fine wire because the metal softens the body of the stranguria.
Upon entering the surgery, it turns towards anesthesia; a person with many mouths does not allow you to deduce from behind them one single mouth, and the moisture that enters him flows towards the other mouths.
Then examine to see if there is a bone or nerve, or whether the dinosaur's cavity is far away or close by, or if it is one dinosae with many mouths and stand on all of that with your full strength from investigating the patient and his pain at massaging where you place your hand.
Towards that from the indications and reasons for tumors, if you stand on all of that and stop in reality then proceed to treatment based on it as if they were true.
The dinosaur appears near or in a position safe from the joint, nerve, vessel, vein, or one of the places you mentioned and the dinosaur pulls away what it provides from them and grabs anything that is enclosed and spoiled meat and excess fat.
What grows in its mouth from meat or wool, and similar things, treat it until it is cured; the tumor was deep-seated and lying straight, so one should excise it as deeply as possible and cleanse all of its putrefied flesh.
Then use the powdered drug in the sharp surgical instruments and insert it into the depth of the tumor that you have felt with iron, do this repeatedly until the strong drug consumes all remaining putrefaction within the tumor's cavity.
Then force it with the bandage that grew into flesh properly until he is cured; if not, do what is prescribed in the recipe. It was a bone and healthy tumor when you examined and excised it according to your guidance, unless something prevented it.
If it is a bone, nerve, or main organ as we have said: if the bone opens and contains some putrefaction and blackness, remove all of that until the decay has left and treat with what binds it until healed; if not cured, apply wax similarly.
Know that you have not eradicated all putrefaction, so remove everything else and scrape it out and purify with the utmost of your efforts; if healed, then cured, otherwise understand that this decay is elsewhere from the original rot - clear away anything remaining.
"Examine the bone and clean it with a firm effort, as the diseased bone was small and you could attract it by using fine forceps so that it would be fixed.
"The bones were numerous and I attracted all of them, leaving nothing by my effort; however, there was an impediment without tying anything in it, and there was no danger in cutting those knots or the meat if they existed.
"The extraction of the bones did not occur during your treatment, as you should leave them untouched for a few days until they are cleansed from the surrounding meat and ligaments; preserve the wound so that it does not become contaminated with what occurred during my procedure.
"But if you are afraid, then use a linen bandage soaked in powdered sulfur mixed with oil or an Egyptian balm soaked linen bandage or one of the green plasters; if they stain those ligaments and bones, it will be easy to extract and attract them.
"There was one large bone resembling the thigh or shank bone, and it looked like what had decayed from it; cleanse it thoroughly until that discoloration and deterioration disappear before continuing with the wound closure, as there is a significant portion of the bone that has rotten away, and the infection may have reached the entire shaft so that suturing would be impossible.
He cut it all the way to where the decay ended, then treated it until it was healed, and I inform you that a man once showed me his leg as an example, who performed this treatment on himself, and this man had long been suffering from (the condition).
Almost three years ago, he had a pain in his leg due to the materials inside his body moving until they reached the leg and caused extensive swelling; it was not from an external source either. It continued over time with errors by physicians until (the wound) opened up.
A lot of bad substances came out during his treatment, causing the leg to swell and oozing fluids such as blood and body moisture; a group of physicians treated him for two years who were not skilled in their crafts.
Until I saw his leg and the substances oozing out from those fluids, they poured out greatly, and the man had lost weight and turned pale; one of these fluids entered the syringe and was propelled to a bone, then all the fluids were examined.
I found them connected to each other from all parts of the leg, which caused fissures in one of those fluids until it revealed a bone that was decayed, darkened and rotten; it penetrated deep into the brain through which something oozed out.
By treating the corrupted bone, I believed it was not due to another kind of decay that had been cut and spread, nor did it seem to have absorbed it; then I forced the wound with a potent medication for an extended period until it healed without any sign of infection. Later, I uncovered the bone again above the first exposure.
I found the decay connected to the bone, spreading from it and also causing infection which was forced with a medication until healed without any sign of infection. Later, I uncovered it again above the first exposure; however, parts of the bone were removed gradually, repaired so that no further decay could occur until cutting near the edge.
He escaped with his wits and was rapidly healed, but this episode required his work; I had to open and remove the bone due to a weakened condition of disease and low probability, causing him great fear of death since it happened at all times from excessive purging, completely cured and fully recovered.
The bone grew solid in its place, his condition was restored throughout his body with strengthened vigor and behavior; he did not suffer from any harm while walking, but a part of the bone fractured elsewhere in the body.
It was necessary to spread it on this condition and take a tight bandage from the protruding bone and command someone to extend it upwards, then tie another bandage made of thicker cloth than the first one.
Then tie it on the flesh underneath the bone and extend its end to attract the flesh downward, so that when you expose the area where you want to spread it there is no harm from the drill in the flesh, and place a board or panel beneath the bone from below firmly.
Because if you did that, the drill would not stop from cutting through the rotten bone; therefore, it should be spread slightly above the location of decay to ensure there is no hidden decay within the bone cavity so that if necessary, it does not need to be reapplied.
The bone was rotten and not protruding, but some parts were connected to others, and the decay was in between or within them; so reveal all sides of the flesh completely, then place a board from below, and spread it from that initial point where decay is present.
If you spread from another point and the application extends slightly beyond the decay we mentioned, then the decay was in a joint of the rotten bone itself, and it spread to where it connects on the other side.
Indeed, if the decay is not in two separate parts, there is no cure but to cleanse, dry out and purify it as best one can.
In any case, there is no remedy if pus or nerve has invaded it; be aware that the incisions and sutures for cutting these bones are numerous depending on their positioning, insertion, thickening, folding, enlargement, shrinkage, firmness, and tenderness. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a remedy for each type of issue related to that work.
Know that the works themselves may require an instrument of a certain type if you have been trained in it for a long time and are familiar with the arts of this trade because those skilled in the craft and having seen various diseases will understand the matter better. One can deduce the appropriate tools for each disease and I am acquainted with you on this subject matter as well, having several instruments at my disposal.
They make examples for imitation and measurement against others, akin to how a saw functions as an example.

Chapter Seventy-Eight: Describing Diseases of the Nose and Mouth.
Section on Fractures and Dislocations.
If the limbs have become infected, either due to an external or internal cause, if it was treated with medication and did not respond to treatment and the infection is spreading within the tissue, and there's nothing to stop its spread.
It was necessary to amputate that limb where the infection has spread and caused a severe illness, which is worse than losing the limb itself, as shown by its turning black until one believes it will be consumed by fire.
Or if the infection spreads after the blackening until it seeks to consume the limb, and takes hold of the body, then an amputation must be performed immediately, as well as if the cause of the decay is due to the gnawing of parasites such as sea urchins or starfish.
The decay or gnawing in the fingertip only requires cutting off the finger, and not to delay the spread of the decay until it reaches the hand as well as if it took hold within the arm, then amputate from the shoulder immediately without delay for the spread of the decay to reach it.
Also, if taken in the arm only to cut off the arm at the joint itself, then pus comes out and it is seen approaching the elbow; but not cutting through the elbow knuckle means the patient will die, and any other method of treatment should be used as much as possible.
Similarly, with the man if pus is taken in the finger cut off the finger at one joint; and taking it on the moustache of a man means cutting off his head down to the neck, cutting the thigh at the knee joint.
And if the pus has risen above the thigh, there is no way but to let it go and Islamize (treat according to) the patient until death; describe extracting or spreading out a band in place where you want to cut, tightening another band above that spot.
The band of one rope is stretched downward and the other band above it upwards, and remove the meat between the two bands with a wide spatula until all the meat unfolds, then cut or spread; it should be ensured that all parts are pierced by the knife.
Not to touch the correct spot in exposing the patient's pain and inflammation may cause bleeding during your procedure; quickly perform hemostasis at that place or carry some clotting agents for blood then proceed with your treatment until it stops bleeding.
Then fasten the injured part with rawhide and treat it until he recovers, and I will tell you an example of a case where a man had this condition in his hand; he described to me as being blackened like scorching fire.
That decay was first observed in his finger until the man took all of it to a physician from him because he saw the decay spreading into the tissue with intensity, seeking pain and burning only to be amputated at the joint.
As time passed, the case of decay was observed in his blackened finger with his eye; I sought to prevent this vice from affecting his hand after he carried away medicines following bodily cleanliness, but he did not apply them and it began to seek out another finger.
The decay eventually took hold of his hand and he was forced to amputate, I prayed for him not to have that vice; it also feared upon the death of severing his hand because the man's strength was failing, so when he passed away, my work was done and left for his land.
He informed me that he had amputated his hand with both of them at rest, and indeed I have told this story to serve those affected by such disease and to be a guide for deduction from it and work upon it.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids and how to administer medication for them.
If a tumor occurs in some of the fleshy parts and the duration extends to months, then it bursts or ruptures and all that was inside is expelled out over time until the position remains empty as if it were an empty vessel.
The skin which has crusted and is not fully infected in its bones, may affect the muscle, nerves, or ligaments; from here it deserves to be called a tumor. It did not extend until the disease affected any of these structures.
Thus, it is called a nasal polyp or zipper; to treat it one should remove all the skin as if turning over and especially if it has crusted like peeling skin and confirmed not to adhere to any structure due to disease.
It is requested that the skin adhere, and if it does not have reached full disease progression, treat with injectable medication; when viewing the tumor, if it appears large in fleshy tissue, notice a yellowish substance extending from it following treatment, this substance emits a scent before being neutralized by Egyptian medicine.
The one who is a decoction and oil, wax, honey, gum resin, combined parts in a vessel and boiled over fire until the medicine becomes thickened, then it comes in honey's jar, from which you take some and strain it with water and hnise, inject into the receptacle, squeezo out their mouths, and leave the drug inside for two hours.
Then it is taken out with a pipe and that is done for days until the receptacle cleanses itself and the remedy goes, and if this medicine has not been injected yet, one may inject it with red lead water; It is to take some clay from grape pits or oak pit ash mixed with the water.
Then flatten it and inject into until the receptacle is evident that it has cleaned itself, there will be no need for Egyptian medicine or red lead water if one had already injected with water mixed with honey containing some gum resin powder.
Or inject it with water and wine mixed because honey is to cleanse and wash, and wine to stick the receptacle, especially if there is wheat ale in it which has a good binding power, if you did that several times until the receptacle's putrefaction passed. Then one may inject what grows meat into it.
As if you were to take the nettle pouch and soak it with rose oil or concentrated syrup, or inject some of the drugs and other patches that we have proven their qualities in the article on patches, then the filling tube was narrow and could not fit into the inserted tube.
Widen it slightly with iron or put a fuse thread in the Egyptian patches or stringer patches until it fits, and if its mouth is also wide, tie them together using a needle and leave as much space as possible for what will be injected into it without adding anything else.
Likewise, if the mouth that empties it is raised above ground, remove it from a lower place where you would empty the wax into the ground because if wax is injected into its cavity, it prevents meat from growing within it.
It is not possible for you to open the pouch downwards as desired so that the inserted part protrudes easily with wax being emptied from it according to what pleases you, and rolls up such that nothing of the hardened wader remains in it.
As for the drugs that are placed on the patch from outside and how to place them on it, it is that you take one of the problematic patches as desired and stretch it until the pouch envelops all of it. Then, using the scoop, make a hole slightly larger than the cavity and extend the flexible membrane over another incision on the wound to cover it adequately, leaving space around the cavity for the pus to be expelled easily without removing the large strip.
For several days, and as for the one on the cavity, that which is removed at any time to let out accumulated pus and to identify whether it contains a lot or little of sediment, ripe or unripe.
And also inspect the position of the abscess itself, if it feels pain there or not, and whether there is a tumor or not. If your treatment continues in this manner, when you see material draining from the cavity's mouth.
Be aware that if the abscess is stuck or attached to scar tissue, it must be removed in two days or within three days; then when examining the wound, replace the bandage with another and find that a thin sediment has drained from the abscess after a long time without any discharge.
A recent examination as some people's meat is slow to heal from surgery and others are the opposite, after a long time in hiding, there comes out pus that has not turned; it means the dressing did not adhere because of delayed healing.
It has been delayed in drying the medicines, and the medicine contains moisture in its composition and hardness like the oak bandage; if it is increased further, there will be an increase in anxiety attacks, and those who consult him are told to take the oak bandage.
It is applied with rose oil and rubbed over it, then kneaded and used; this act may be done if the oak bandage does not come because of honeyed syrup if it is cooked until boiling, diluted, and taken with pearl barley, vinegnugar (a mix of pearl barley, vinegar, and sugar), crushed together and powdered over honey. Then it is wrapped around the dressing or poured over with honeyed syrup boiled until thickened, and powdered spices are sprinkled on it before placing the gauze and binding it tightly.
He has used in cases like this a long thorn and Ammodaulus root, carcinum seeds, scraping powder, and single or multiple quartnions to drill, scrape, grate on honey as described above, but the treatment was prolonged and it did not cure; he does not know that there is decay within it.
He has affected the bones or in solid nerves and ligaments, using the treatment of Nasorius as it progresses.
Chapter Nine Eighty.
In the treatment of dacrym and worn teeth, amputation of a swollen finger, and separation of fused fingers.
The dacrym is a large flesh that grows under the incisor of the hand or foot and perhaps also on other fingers; if it persists and neglects its treatment, it becomes inflamed and ulcerous.
Or it becomes sour until it eats away at the root of the tooth and perhaps devours all of it, and maybe spreads the decay to the bone until it has a foul smell and becomes rotten on the end of the finger and its color is blackened; if treated as we mentioned in sectioning and does not heal.
It was necessary to cut out all the nits that sprouted from the finger, then sew up the wound afterward, as this is highly beneficial; and if the bone is correct and the finger also is correct.
The joint cup of the finger had compressed the meat inward and made it swell, so it was necessary to place a thin poultice under the joint that compresses the flesh and raise it upwards and cut that flesh with ease.
Place the remaining flesh on boiled medicinal ointment until all of it dissolves, then treat with poultices until healed; and if the rot has affected the bone, it was necessary to cut out that bone and remove it as long as there is rotten bone remnant.
I observed that consumption and rot aim at the finger only, so it was recommended to amputate it during one of the treatments as soon as mentioned, then treat it until healed; if injured by a blow or injury causing severe pain in the finger, it is necessary first to drain the illness.
Then the finger was cut with a sharp tool in an oblique manner from top to bottom, and care is taken not to extend the cut to the flesh beneath the finger as this would worsen the illness and severe pain and be a cause for excessive meat growth at that spot; then treat the position by what soothes the diseases.
As for the excessive fingers that are born in some people's hands, sometimes they have flesh throughout, or perhaps bones and nails are present within one of them originating from a finger joint.
Or it may grow from a finger joint, possibly moving if it grew on the fingernail and not moving if it grew in the fingernail bed; that which has flesh only can be cut easily by cutting off at its root or by clipping near its origin.
As for the ones whose roots are in a joint, its treatment is difficult by cutting it off and removing it; as for those that grow on a fingernail, they should first be cut close to the flesh then straighten the bone using one of those scissors agreed upon for this.
Then it is treated until healed, and as for the excessive webbing that often presents fingers to each other, this can be what humans give birth to and should be incised when caused by a wound or burn in such cases.
Until the fingers return to their natural position, then place a peg or perforated tube filled with rose oil between them so that they do not touch quickly and separate them or make a thin sheet of soft metal until they are properly aligned.
And thus exposing the fingers to be touched by a hand may break that adhesion as needed and correct it with its shape.
Chapter Nine.
Only Dohala. (This seems to be a proper noun or name, likely referring to the surgeon Albucasis.)
Dohala is a swollen, bulging vein that occurs in most body parts and more commonly on the legs, especially at the popliteal fossa, Achilles tendon, and lower extremities. It was first necessary to perform vigorous leg massage several times forcefully. (This translation assumes "الدوالى" refers to a type of varicose vein.)
Then remove the thrombus (blood clot) from it, and if treated with iron twice, one to evacuate the black blood and the other to dilate the vein and expel sweat, first raise the leg using hot water baths as previously described for this type of condition.
Until the thick blood clot is resolved, then tighten the patient's thigh from top to bottom above the bandage towards below it, and rub until sweat appears in one spot or two spots or three wide gaps.
Then black blood appears on your hand from bottom to top of the thigh and upwards until a suitable amount or as much as the strength of the patient allows, then it is tied and ordered fasting with foods made for melena and vomiting and diarrhee resume.
When the limb fills up and damages the patient, if it is on this condition hair will fall out from the leg then enters the bathroom and dips his leg in hot water until sweat turns red and flows or a strong exercise occurs.
If he has not gone to the bathroom yet and warms up the limb, then rubs the skin next to the sweat in a line either at the end near the thigh or at the bottom near the knee, then opens the skin with needles and removes sweat from each side until it shows for the touch.
He appears red and inflamed upon emergence; after shedding the skin, he also resembles a stretched membrane. Then it enters underneath causing swelling until it rises above the skin and is denoted by a sickly pale color. Another crack then forms near that crack to the extent of three fingers.
Then the skin peels off from the veins, showing it; then it rises with swelling as before and is denoted by another pale indicator. Another crack or many cracks occur if necessary.
Then he pulls and cuts at the last crack on the joint; then it is drawn out from the second fissure, then pulled towards the one above until it is drawn out from the third fissure entirely, all of them until they exit completely after being severed.
It is not for you to pull and cut without first inserting a thin needle with dual strength, attaching it, pulling through the swelling underneath, and grasping it with your hand on all sides until it exits; preserve it in such a way that it does not break off - if it breaks then he struggles greatly.
Entering the patient afflicted, if he collapses entirely, place him on a surgical cot with mashed dates soaked in wine or oil and treat until he recovers; it was an effective remedy with tinctures causing convulsions towards his limbs.
He should not be stirred as we have mentioned; he must be gently turned at each of his jerks and positions, then attached with pins until fully relaxed. When you tear it apart, keep it intact so that if it bleeds or is lacerated, do not let him convulse again but restrain your effort to hold him still.
Image of the hook used to tear apart the patient:
Image of the opaque pins:
It does not have the distinctiveness of pins' rows and is neither sharp-edged for it to bleed nor loose-angled as we described, because it is fine-pointed and cuts blood gently without any advantage in thickness.
Section on the Sharp and the Ninth:
In case of a blood spill in moderation:
This blood is generated in the calves, as seen in hot regions like Hajaz and Arab countries and in warm lands with sparse sweat glands; it may also originate from other bodily positions not related to legs and results from an infectious condition underneath the skin.
As for what occurs inside the abdomen, in living things and worms, eating turnips and newly-born worms between the skin and flesh, a sign that this type of bleeding begins is severe heat in the leg, then swelling at the location, then the bleeding starts to stop and comes out from that swolche point.
If it appears at the edge in plants or animals, then wrap a small piece of lead about one to two kilograms weight and twist it together with pliers and leave the lead hanging.
When it comes out from inside the lead wrapped around and twisted, if it hangs for a long time, cut off part of it, wrap the rest and do not separate it from its origin until it has all come out because if you cut it, it will contract and enter into the flesh causing tumors and pus at that location.
Therefore, it should be drained and squeezed a little at a time until all comes out of the rest so that nothing is left in the body; this type of bleeding can come out in some people up to five spans and ten fingers long.
He had reached a length of twenty cubits, so when treating him you should insert a catheter in his wound and bind it tightly along the body until everything comes out from the material; then try to relieve the position with medication for several days.
Then treat him with tumor therapy, and this type of blood may be abundant, especially if it appears in the man's joint or within himself due to excessive saliva; he has gushing forth from every mouthful, so treat as we mentioned previously for division and progression.
The second ninth section.
In the hole under the skin where a worm is born, called cattle pox.
This disease is called cattle pox in some of our countries because it is often shown to cows and is a small worm that is born between the skin and muscle, which bleeds upward and downward throughout the body.
It is felt when it spreads from part of the body to another until it breaks through where it has broken through in the skin, forming a sore and oozing out a mixture like that shown by worms, insects, and acorns in the abd grove.
However, it is expected that if the disease descends into the body and rises to the head and reaches the eyes, then they open widely, and it exits, the eye is healed significantly; but if you want to treat it or extract it, it can only be done by applying pressure and causing it to appear.
It was necessary to grasp what is above and below it tightly with pincers, then pull on it and extract it; if it descended into the thigh and could not be found in its original location until it was burned away, then the greatest expected spread of disease would be to the eye as we said.
I saw that it may have become near the eye in the head, grasped beneath the cheek tightly with forceps and then pulled on it and extracted it; the patient should agree to cleanse their body with suitable medicines for dissolving poor quality pastes and preventing foods conducive to disease.
The Third Chapter Nine.
In the treatment of the disease known as the fugitives.
This disease called the fugitives in our land presents as pain in some organs and then moves from organ to organ, as I have described it to you. (Please note: In this translation, "النافر" is a placeholder name for an unspecified condition or set of symptoms; without additional context from the original text, this term cannot be translated into English with accuracy.)
I directed the woman suffering from an issue in her arm, and upon uncovering her hand, she blew air slowly into a cord tied to her forearm. After an hour had passed, when that blow caused it to inflate, it rose quickly towards its tip like a worm wriggging upwards as fast as possible.
If she moved from one point to another, the pain would disappear and stabilize in that area, then waited an hour before proceedcuing up her body until it reached her other arm; finally, she noticed that her entire body was rotating as if she were seeing herself.
I was amazed at how quickly he transitioned from limb to limb and I had not seen this disease behave in such a way on this type of patient except that I have observed groups finding relief as they transfer pain from one limb to another, but I had never seen it quite like this in this woman.
I considered this only because the woman was of a slender build and exposed to cold from here, which showed that she experienced such a draft; it seems unlikely to appear on someone who is wealthy and well-fed with plump skin as described earlier.
If you wish to treat him and he feels pain, then turn your head as we mentioned before, quickly bandage above and below with a ligature, and incise until the pus is released from its place.
It is not to be treated by rubbing the body and expelling winds as you would a swallow's egg or seeds of sesame, similar to it with medicines,.
Chapter Four and Nineteeby Albucasis. (Note: This is an assumed translation based on the context given; actual chapter names may vary.)
In pus discharge. (Note: "في" translates to "in," and it's used here in a medical context referring to the discharge of pus from an abscess or wound.)
Sutures can vary according to their types and the locations from where they are found in the body, and as for variations by type, some are large, others small, made of glass that is either sealed or non-sealed and with three corners or four corners. (Note: This excerpt describes different characteristics of sutures used in surgery.)
And some have teeth, and others have spines; those that occur in certain organs become two types either as major hollowed-out organs like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles or so on. (Note: This part of Albucasis' text refers to different features of sutures based on where they are found in the body.) At times a needle is inserted into one of these parts, and signs of death that I have described to you should be avoided if this needle were to be extracted from it, then the death would afflict its owner in most cases. When these poor signs do not appear and the needle is drawn out from within the bone, treat the wound; if it involves brain marks, if a nail falls upon the brain and exits through the skull, then the severe headache and dizziness will arise from that.
When these poor signs do not appear and the needle is drawn out from within the bone, treat the wound; if it involves brain marks, if a nail falls upon the brain and exits through the skull, then the severe headache and dizziness will arise from that. Redness in both eyes and redness of the tongue, agitation of mind, repeated fainting spells; perhaps blood will exit through the nostrils or ears, perhaps speech may cease and voice vanish, humidity resembling pus leaves the wound site causing symptoms similar to meat juice.
These signs appeared and hold onto treating the illness if the needle did not come out; as for the marks of the needle, if it falls upon the heart near the left chest and feels like it has penetrated something solid rather than an empty space.
Sometimes the arrow's movement resembles a heartbeat, and from the wound flows black blood, followed by coldness in the limbs, cold sweating, indicating that death is unavoidable; if the arrow pierces the lung, blood like butter escapes from the wound.
The veins that reach the throat swell and change color, breathing becomes rapid and deep while requesting cold air intake; if an arrow pierces a protective barrier in the chest near the ribs, breathing is severe with intense pain.
The abdominal organs swell and move, if the arrow hits the liver then severe pain follows with blood resembling its color pouring from the wound; if it pierces the intestine, undigested food may come out of the wound.
He is commanded to act, and if the arrow hits the abdomen causing swelling, urine may come out of the wound or an unhealed puncture; if it affects the testes, there will be no treatment success nor in expelling the arrow's effects; hitting the prostate causes urine to flow.
Prominence to the outside and increased pain in the patient indicates that it is fractured, while the protruding parts such as the head, eyes, neck, jaw, shoulder blade, spine, scrotum, thighs, legs, and so on of other body parts should be handed over at once.
If the arrow did not hit an artery or nerve and the arrow was unpoisoned, then I will inform you about some things that you saw from these arrows so that you can infer treatment from them; this is to say that the arrow penetrated a man at the root of his nose.
She pulled the arrow out from another side under the eyelid and it was clean, with no poison in his eye; another arrow was extracted from a Jew who had been pierced in the eyeball beneath the lower lid, and the arrow had slanted off without breaking off any piece other than its small base that adheres to wood.
And a large arrow from the Crusaders' arrows, a square iron shaft without earrings in either of the Jews who were unharmed and nothing had happened to their eye, and another arrow was extracted from the nose of one of his soldiers, and the arrow was oriented towards Arabia.
He who has ears pierced, which were split between the earrangs and he was caught in a loop until it was loosened by the Crusaders and came out unharmed; another arrow escaped from another man who had fallen into his belly, and we assessed that he would die from this.
When three hundred days or so had passed, and nothing of his conditions changed, the arrow was split open, shifted on it, and came out unharmed without any mishap occurrnce; I saw a man who fell with an arrow in his back which healed the wound.
After seven years, the arrow came out at its origin on his thigh; I saw a woman who had fallen with an arrow in her belly and healed it, the arrow remained without any change from anything, and she found no harm from it whatsoever due to natural actions,.
I saw another man who fell with an arrow in his face and healed the wound, feeling little pain; such cases are common, and one of them came out from a Sultan's chief when it had fallen into his nose to the right side slightly.
The entirety of the blade was bound and treated after the arrow had penetrated for three days, upon finding a narrow wound, I carefully explored it with a fine probe. However, he did not feel anything, but found one wound and pain under his right ear near the fissure.
It was determined that this first wound came from the arrow's side, which I sutured at its location using a dressing, hoping to draw out what remained and for the site to mature. However, an increase in attraction occurred, indicating the possibility of complications with the affected area.
I dressed it for many days without any incident, and the illness ended after expelling something for a prolonged period until one day within his nose he sensed an arrow. Upon being informed of this news, I applied the sharpest medicine to the wound over several days.
I opened and cleaned it, until I felt the fine arrowhead attached to a piece of wood; then I applied that sharp medicine to the wound, which revealed itself in about four months with the arrow's edge and passed away after some time.
Then, when the wound had expanded and allowed fingers to enter it, he was drawn to and moved within until a pathway could not be cleared for exiting. He did not relineback, but rather repositioned with tools until gripping tightly one day at the narrow opening as it appeared in another part of the wound.
The doctors ruled that the nasal skin was not to be incised and sutured, cleansing the wound and healing it completely without harm from any infection; I will tell you how to extract some of the arrows as a measure and guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because these parts of the craft and their details are not fully described or covered by the book, only the skilled artisan gauges much on little and from what is missing discerns new work and a new tool at the oddest moments.
If one descends from this craft, I say that the arrows exit only from parts of the body where they were inserted in two ways: either by attraction from their original position or in opposition to another direction, whence they also exit.
Either the spear is prominent at the location of fat and pulls out, or if it should not come out when initially placed, then you ought to leave it until the surrounding flesh heals enough that it can be pulled out more easily, and likewise if embedded in a bone.
You should not remove it for days if it comes out each day when you pull and move it, but you should not attempt to extract the spear from around the same bone with a gentle probe until there is enough expansion for extraction and then pulling it out.
The embedded spear in the skull bone penetrated into one of the brain's hemispheres, and displayed some signs from the illness you mentioned yesterday; hold onto pulling out the spear until he recovers after several days.
He inserted the hook in the direction of the needle, and it was very deep, so you should not pull on the needle but use the forceps around the needle as I instructed you, then address the location until he recovers, and if the neednopasses to a place within the body. He went numb when he explored it with the probe, and I felt it being pulled by some devices that are used for drawing it in; but she could not handle it through the small wound nor pull out the needle from within her body, and there was no bone or nerve.
He removed it until the wound expanded and was able to pull out the needle; he had ears that held on to him, so they extracted all the fat from both sides using every possible method you can think of, but take over if you cannot remove the fat within the ear incisions and pierce them until she is free.
If you tried to extract the needle from any location, use your fingertips on all sides until it comes out and give close attention not to break the needle while pulling or drawing; but she could not handle it at that time.
For a few days until the meat has putrefied, then return it and at that time your vein will bleed; therefore follow what we mentioned in its treatment on page [X], and preserve your strength by cutting off an artery or tendon or ligament, and use the method.
Simplify the arrow and do so gently, as you described, and ensure that when attracted by a magnetic stone it becomes like how it was when the arrow hit, as is suitable for its treatment.
You cannot do that, use what you can from the treatments, and as for an arrow exiting against another side, either it has emerged with something coming out externally or find the tip of the arrow by touch close to the skin.
Pull on it as much as possible with your fingers, then attract it and it will ease out; hold the phalanx of your finger in a circular motion until the arrow acts upon the bone and expands itself, then attract it.
If not, leave it for a few days until it comes out; if the arrow returns in it pushing with it, then the shaft has fallen and pushes towards using a hollowed-in device to insert its cavity into the spermatic cord and then push with it.
Indeed, the awl was hollow; it was pushed in with an instrument that entered into this cavity. Thus, the awl made its way out easily. Had the awl been poisoned within what remained of the meat, one should ensure all of it is consumed and then treat it accordingly if possible.
Indeed, the awl that was located in the chest or abdamoentum or mamma or side was similar to what one would probe with a probe; you can open and preserve it by removing blood vessels or nerves and extracting it.
Then, seal the wound if necessary and stitch it up; picture the sutures that attract the awls:.
Its ends resemble a bird's beak as if it were fashioned into an awl when grabbing the awl or something that didn't leave, and you can make various types of small, medium, large ones depending on the thickness of the awl, its length, and the size of the wound.
Picture the hollow punch:.
Image of the muffled punch:.
This muted end, like a taper, makes it easier to enter the hollow awl and push:.
Chapter V and IX.
In the Abdominal Region.
The abdomen in which the usual incision has been made involving thirty veins, sixteen of which are on the head and two arteries known as the lacrimal ducts that appear behind the eyebrows, along with two vessels found under the surface of each eye called nasal branches, and two veins located in the tear gland areas.
The vein placed in the center of the forehead, and the vein found on either side of the nose, along with two vessels located in the neck region called jugulars; also the veins situated on the upper lip and lower lip known as labial arteries; furthermore these vessels referred to as facial and labial arteries.
The vessels dissected in the arm and hand, which consist of five veins; one being called vena comitans from the side referred to as wolf-like and commonly known as cephalic or forehead artery; another is the middle vessel named cubital or forearm artery, formed by branches of the brachialis and cephalic.
The brachialis, which is the subject matter on the human side and also called ulna or commonly known as abdominal artery; ligament of the arm situated on the palm and referred to as carpal, a prominent feature above the thumb with clear manifestation, along with tendons.
The sweat that is between the upper and lower thigh, has two branches; on the leg there are three vessels: one under the knee-pad from the wild side, the second below the calf, its place at the knee from the human side, and the woman's vessel near the back of the wild side.
On the other leg there are three vessels like those: The two veins behind the ears are useful for chronic dropsy, hysteria, epilepsnce and persistent head sores, and how to expel them from what causes it.
It is that the headache and its last stage are located at the site of the veins with a sore, properly lanced, then the illness is strangled by a ligature to the neck until the veins appear and their place behind the ears in the two lowest positions from the top. You should examine them with your finger where you feel them pulsate under your finger - that's how it was instructed using the thread.
Then take a lancet, the one known as nashle and insert it under the vein in the skin until it reaches the bone then raise your hand with the vein and skin to above and cut the vein along with the skin making a neat incision two fingertip wide.
He explains it and sends the appropriate amount of blood, then grips them tightly with bandages and lets them rest until they recover; he begins by cutting their hair and nails in his first book. As for the two veins in the temples, removing them benefits a chronic patient suffering from headaches, severe pain, continuous swelling, and intense curiosity towards the eyes.
They are removed from what you have described as the ailment tightens its grip on him until blood is seen and his pulse becomes clearly palpable under your fingertip; then, using thread or silk, elevate the skin from above the vein up to your index finger.
The non-tightening clamp is inserted from below and elevates the vein; it has been performed as in the other two veins, sends blood according to your need, then alleviates the ailment's grip and places your finger on the vein for an hour.
Then, a quilt and bandage are placed on top tightly, and he is left until recovery; this is mentioned first in his book: cutting them off benefited after removing the temporal vein for chronic facial conditions such as eczema, sores, and reddish discoloration.
How to extract what you have described that will strangle the patient and tighten its neck until blood appears, then take the instrument called the saw, which is as follows:
The pointed spike that is in the head of the saw should be placed on the same vein and struck from above with a brush or something similar, allowing the blood to flow into the container you desire, then relieve the patient'amoor by tightening until he recovers breathing.
It should be opened only with a blunt edge, not as sharp as the usual cutting edge of knives but slightly wider at the tip to avoid deviation because bone is close and if it were thin, the blade might break in case of use.
The veins above the eyes are beneficial for eye ailments due to redness, pus, and facial diseebacteria. To extract them, you should strangle the patient by tightening with an enema then carefully take hold of each vein at its head using a slightly blunt edge without deviation.
The location should not have fat in it, or the blade's pointed edge might break. Instead, send blood to your container and cover them with a leather bag then tighten overnight to extract them; the nose vein is useful for severe fevers.
Severe headaches and face diseases such as red swelling in the nose, especially if chronic; how to alleebate it by tightening the afflicted neck with your left hand and taking a fine long pill.
Protrudes from the center of its body between the nose joint due to humors rising up, as the sweat does not appear there because blood rises at that moment; take your hand with a pill and gently rub it until you drain some blood then tie it off overnight.
Purging them is effective by narrowing the chest and beginning skin sores as well as black-colored diseases that appear on the skin such as blackness, ulcers, and rotten sores; how to purge them so they tighten under them in their throats using twigs and have the operator stand on top of the affliction.
The affliction is on a chair then the sweat runs along its length, expansively but slightly; then it swells from moderate or as much blood as needed and do likewise with the other sweat then untie the twig.
The two sutures are applied moderately not to suffocate the ailment, and he is left overnight; then the wound heals. As for the jugular veins, it is beneficial to remove them after the quiffs have been removed because they prevent cavities in the mouth, decay of the teeth, putrid sores, bad ulcers, and splitting of the gums and bad ulcers.
The one located at the nose and nearby, how to remove them so that they hug your illness in front of you and tighten their neck with a cloth, then transform their teeth and look towards the veins that you see one on the right side of the lip and the other on its left and squeeze them dry.
That is also that they have thin black veins, cut them into a small piece, the shapes are on you and did not swell as to close off larger pieces and separate them, and similarly make in the veins that are in the lower lip.
And as for the veins that are under the tongue, it is beneficial to remove them after removing the quiffs of the tunnels that exist in the throat from hoarseness disease and diseases of the mouth, how to remove them so they sit with your illness between your hands like a sunshade and raise their tongue and look under the tongue one side vein and the other side vein and their color turn into black.
They were dissected and preserved without damage to the pieces, as beneath them there are vessels; if one of these vessels leaks blood, then the three veins in the foreskin that typically bleed during circumcision can be separated into two.
If they inserted a broad rehna leaf or an olive into the incision, or if they made a cut with a scalpel blade [and this is his image]. Image of the broad rehna leaf.
It will serve as a dilation to open the prominent visible closed and filled blood vessels, which cause thick red bleeding; here is an image of the olive leaf [as you see]. Image of the olive leaf.
This scalpel has a thinner and longer edge that serves to stop the bleeding from thin yellowish vessels; here is an image of the nail [as seen]. Image of the scalpel blade.
This nail is used for cutting and can be found in different sizes depending on the thickness of the vessels, also it helps to infer other types as well; when crafted by a skilled artisan, it becomes famous.
The bael being one of the three vessels, is effective for stopping bleeding as it draws blood from passages under the neck and throat that lead to the chest and abdomen; when stopping a leak, the sealer should be cautious while doing so and have their arm raised in case there are vessels beneath where an incorrect cut with the instrument could cause further leakage.
In case of blood leakage, it is preferable not to tie off the bleeding with a ligature but to puncture an incision using a needle; if clear serous fluid does not appear, one should avoid and modify it or request some sutures from another source.
If it leaks at its place, use a ligature on the arm and puncture with a needle as we said to stop it; before tightening the tourniquet, one should examine the position until the pulse site is identified then learn from the string.
Then tie the arm and puncture a slanting wound with a needle as we said, so that the incision is away from the artery's position; when you see it pump under the tourniquet in the position where you learned with the string, then that pump is the arterial pulse and avoid it.
When you see blood after puncturing as it should, and the blood is thin and red, knowing that it's from an artery, then quickly press your finger on it for a long time; when you withdraw your finger, the blood stops flowing within seconds after releasing the tourniquet.
Leave him, and prevent the patient from neglecting it by keeping on his back without moving for days until he recovers; then if the blood has not stopped and prevails over him and no antidote of the bowels has reached you when they become visible, both sides will shrink and the blood will stop.
Take a grape skin, crack it open and take one half. Bind it firmly over the vein site with ropes or thread until the next day; if the blood stops, then treat according to what is provided from his case of stopping the bleeding through clamping techniques, and cutting off the blood will not be difficult in most cases.
For a small wound, enable the bandaging on the arm; as for the bleeding vein, it will be beneficial to draw the blood from above the head and below the body so that it is gathered from a branch of spiderwebs and a branch of pine resin as we mentioned.
The drafter should be on his back after stopping the bleeding, so that below him accumulates a swelling and nerve is struck causing it to numb its pulse and possibly not breathe from the start, as this namenumerous often presents itself.
Indeed, there are people who do not fully understand what they should do to clear their nose. They make a hole with the nail of one finger and avoid using force on the vein. If the blood is between two veins, it will flow out for a while; as for the bloody mucus, curing it by drawing the blood from the head is beneficial.
It is beneficial for eye diseeback and in this nosebleed it should be done if you wish; to stop it <to stop it>; press with a lemon or olive oil plug, or with the flat side of ripe rue leaves, because it calms all veins as they do not have blood vessels or nerves.
However, it should be for you when stopping to avoid pressing the bone of the muscle only and to take a gentle position, not harming even if the first strike does not stop again with repeated stops but in some people may inflame if stopped at the first stroke.
However, that swelling does not harm him at all; as for how to stop and its characteristics and what should proceed in healing it firstly you should know that stopping is either used to preserve health only.
If in the case of diseases and those used to preserve health and its sustainability, as well as preventing diseases from occurrcuing, then the cure is in one of the three bloods within the vessel: greater veins, arteries, or capillaries. And it should occur at the beginning of spring if swellings appear.
The cure will be on Sunday or Tuesday after the day has passed for three hours, and as for the cure used in diseases there is no fixed time but when necessity and urgency require it from night or day.
In every hour and at all times, it is not permisseb to cure boys until they have reached fourteen years of age, and the elderly who have exceeded sixty should not be cured for any reason.
It is advisable to empty the bag before curing with a smooth injection in case there is a large amount of accumulated pus that attracts towards the vessels upon cure from the bag, causing the main organs harm by foul leaking fluids; and do not cure those who are obese or diabetics until it passes away from them.
Be wary also after vomiting, diarrheein, constipation, and excessive exertion, sports, staying up late, fasting, or any other factors that weaken the body's physical and psychological strength; then examine for clotting of mixtures if the blood is thick.
By food, drinks, and medications if possible; then enter the bath if nothing prevents or moderate exercise to improve blood circulation and prevent clotting in the chest as we said; ensure that it empties from his breast by noon of all psychological negative symptoms.
As melancholy, anger, fear, and all physical ailments such as fatigue, prolonged standing, diarrhea, and the like; provide for gathering things according to people's customs of using them from perfumes, breezes, tents, etc., depending on each person's ability.
Then the patient sits on a cushion that is higher than the one the healthy person sits on; then he takes out his arm and moves it twice or thrice, and the afflicted twists the rope of his calf muscles with both hands twice or thrice, maintaining moderate tension.
Because tension, when not moderate, either by excess in tension prevents blood flow or, if it is too lax, also prevents bleeding; then after tension one should rub the wound with both hands simultaneously.
Until the artery swells and becomes palpable by touch, then the ligature applied with aged olive oil is wiped off, after which the left thumb from the hand is placed on the same artery underneath the spot where one wishes to stop it a little so that blood does not flow back when struck. Because from an artery found as a ligature, when stopped and filled with fumes it is placed on, it decreases under the ligature and deceives the ligature; if it opens, then only that its opening is narrow.
Therefore, it should be stabilized and relaxed in all this, then the ligature is removed if the artery opens after that; otherwise, return to the spot a little under or above quickly if the place does not swell up.
If a tumor or swelling of the patient is spread for one or two days, then do not tie the ligature as it may bring blood clots and inflammation, and does not enter the bath; then return to stopping if you wish so, but the ligature slips and its opening remains small, and the bleeding runs thin.
I feared that not enough blood would escape from the hole itself, so to ensure it was straightened and opened slightly more, one should act quickly before the position shifts; for many people, the position may shift when opening is small.
I saw that it might shift; for it does not have a fixed position, and there is no oil on it or any other kind of antiseptic; however, this place allows the blood to flow easily, making it better than just using oil itself or among all containers.
Use antiseptic oil on all of your veins when blood flow is difficult; the tourniquet or bandage might do that, if placed at the site, then the blood will run and dissolve it if either one is applied to the location.
When there is a large swelling at the site and it frequently occurs, especially if someone has not been treated or the sweating opening is small; immerse a cloth in warm salted water and press on the swelling for an hour until it dissolves.
This should be done after the blood has completely drained from the sweat duct itself or another, if it remains in place for days resulting in blackening or greening, then nothing can improve that; I recommended applying a poultice of ground olive oil and myrrh dissolved in vinegcu.
He takes something from the bottle of folding, and often a rash or nodule appears when you squeeze it on his hand; if found there, it is a nodule upon your touching him, beware lest you do something as we mentioned.
It may bleed a small amount of blood, but bind it with a dressing to stabilize the position and then treat it as usual until healed; each person should let out an amount of blood according to their strength and what is usually seen in terms of color from the blood.
If the blood is dark, let it out until it turns red; if you see it thick, let it run until it becomes thin; and similarly for a severe case, let go of its edge; it should be strong to expel the blood in one shot.
Make the pustule larger and the applicator wide for someone who is weak compared to that, let it drain in intervals, and the hole should be narrow; ideally used for draining sweat, a wedge-shaped incision without sutures.
This is the method of bleeding from hemorrhage and severing a nerve, it is perfect for bleeding by length and breadth; when one is accustomired to blood-letting in cases of concealed hemorrhage, it is proper to feed him before the blood-letting on something made with wheat soaked in pomegranate juice or almond milk.
If the color is purple and blood flows in three or four times, then if it improves mood, take bread soaked in myrtle wine or honeyed wine with spices or in sweet licorice-flavored wine before bleeding.
If hemorrhage occurs during blood-letting and the cause is a lot of blood loss, it should be given lamb's water and delicate licorice wine, use emplastic in large quantities, rub his chest with it and apply what we have mentioned on sectioning at the site of bleeding.
If it is to relieve and sedate the arm and secondarily bleed, for those who have much evacuation and weakness should slightly relax the blood in subsequent days with appropriate strength.
As for someone who wants to reduce his arm and calm the bleeding, if he is a strong person, it should be done within seven or nine hours from the first hour. And as for wanting to draw blood away from his body towards the side where the injury occurred, he should go on the second or third day.
As for someone with a lot of blood that has boiled and thickened, causing fever, it is necessary to expel the blood all at once in large quantities so that the wound opens up after being examined under all conditions of hemorrhage. And place your hand on the pulse when bleeding occurs to prevent death from occurr. The wound opens up frequently if the hemorrhage is neglected and a lapse of attention occurs, but it should not be rushed in case you want to reduce and calm the blood quickly.
The skin pores have closed and the blood is struggling to ooze out, causing severe congestion or overwhelming power in response, which is extremely detramoirtal but either let it pass until hemorrhage secondly occurs or use a tourniquet so that clotted blood does not remain in the facial veins.
He took something of salt dissolved in water or carried on him some frankincense or olibanum and breathed it gently until the blood flowed out, so that he became sweaty profusamo.
He must not rest until the tumor is settled, so necessity called for a second bloodletting, whether it be above that position or in another arm or on another sweat.
As for removing the armband, it was replaced by an ointment and pitch if they were not hidden because they are attached to each other, and how to remove so that it enters his hand in hot water until the extremity turns red and sweat appears clearly on its surface then tie above it with a band slightly tightly.
Then sweat will run a little bit with no show or length, and the opening should be wide enough, so that your bloodletting is just above the joint of the hand slightly; it would be difficult for the blood to leave the hand in hot water, so let the blood flow into the bowl of hot water.
Until your need is that in the summer days you were free of re-immersing the hand in hot water and more so that let the blood flow into the hot water during winter, this sweat was relieved from all the sweats. Because there is no irritating vein or nerve, and as for the fascia slym of the right hand, it is effective in causes of jaundice, and how to remove it so that it adheres to the joint of your hand by tying with a cord or your foot after entering hot water until the sweat comes out.
Because there is no irritating vein or nerve, and as for the fascia slym of the right hand, it is effective in causes of jaundice, and how to remove it so that it adheres to the joint of your hand by tying with a cord or your foot after entering hot water until the sweat comes out. It is very evident then to remove it with slight displacement and if it gets all of it does not harm you at all, and save your hand by using a splint so that underneabody there are nerves of the fingers and the position red from muscle tissue, then return the hand to hot water.
And let the blood run in it, if you did not put it back into hot water, it will coagulate in your vein and refrain from bleeding until as much as necessary to pour oil and salt on it so that it does not quickly become inflamed.
And you should do the same with all small vessels, and as effective to remove it from the left hand is for causes of paralysis and so you do in removing it as you did in the second one regardless, and removal of the sphenoid bone was beneficial for diseases that occur on the lower body such as urological disorders.
Absorption of Menstrual Blood and Diseases of the Kidneys and Leg Ulcers, Chronic Conditions and Their Treatamoents; How a Man Can Enter Hot Water to Be Moved by a Physician Until the Veins Leak Out, Then Squeezing Above the Joints with Pressure Bandages and Ointment Placed at the Knee Resembling Towards the Cheek.
It spreads on the man's face in large numbers, leaving one part broader or near the knee when joined together; it is better and calmer: if leaked from the man's face, preserve the nerves underneath his skin.
Make your leakage as if you want to drain it, and make the bandage loose; preventing blood from flowing out of his leg in hot water and leaving blood draining within until empty; an error of leaking with initial drainage.
Leak a bit above, then the position is safe and does not fear if preserved from nerves as we said; also do with another man's bandage similarly, but menstrual blood should be placed on the side of the step as we mentioned at the turn of the leg.
Benefit of Draining the Knee Pain if It Is Due to Hot Blood and How To Drain it So That The Ailment Enters the Bathroom and Accelerates, Strengthens And Raises The Leg From Below The Knee Up To The Ankle With Four Fingers Wrapped In Fine Cotton: It Will Not Be Seen Except By This.
If the Draining Appears On Any Condition That Comes To You, Either Distortion Which Is Best Or Push It With A Catheter Or Make An Incision And Its Location Is Safe: Most People Are Extremamo Hidden Deeply Such That They Could Not Find It.
Draining Do Not Show Any Sensation And A Part Of It That Appears On The Back Of The Foot Towards The Heel And Toe, Preserving From Nerves And Sending As Much Blood As Desired.
Then Relieve The Pain, Place On Draining Location Cotton And Squeeze The Location Swiftly As It Will Relieve Quickly.

In Size And How To Use It.
The Saw Can Be Made Of Bone, Wood Or Brass And Glass, Its Size Is Either One Where Both Are With Condition And Blood Outlet And The Other Is Without Condition And Larger.
This is the size that must be on two faces.
And the forts of snakes are both sides of the throat, and the molar fort is below the lower jaw bone, and the two shoulder forts, and the diaphragm fort on the flank of the leg, and the twin forts in the middle of the arms, and the calf forts, and the ankle forts.
The size only attracts blood from the congested muscles in the flesh and for this reason, it does not lose its strength by dropping a pus cavity or it should not operate as fire or non-fire during any disease that is characterized by swelling until the body empties itself.
The need called for the size at all times, in the beginning of the month and at the end and during any time.
That is because some people, if there is an excess of blood, they need to evacuate it by the bucketful and find weight in their head, dizziness, and headache; others find swelling and redness on their face, forehead, neck, and chest; still others find pimples on their face and cheeks, darkness, and narrowing in their eyes.
That is because some find laughter and taste of blood in their mouth, swelling of the gums, bleeding, and others find frequent sleeping; among them see blood and redness during their sleep along with wounds, surgeries, and similar things, whenever we have seen something like that.
Particularly, if it occurs in the middle third of the month after two or three hours past noon, a pounding remedy by pressure works for the head heaviness and eye watering.
However, it should be after purging of bowels and this pounding remedy can serve as a substitute for opium but one should be cautious to use it if the brain is cold or has had a bout of illness, as it may cause significant harm.
Therefore, the elders should not be used for cold diseases and those afflicted with it often forget things after being born into it.
Therefore, the surgeon should be ordered to lower his hand a little with the muzzle towards the ground in fear of inducing amnesia, and instead of an oblique scalpel use, he uses one without bloodletting or incision.
Therefore, it benefits from treating asthma and shortness of breath, as well as obstructing the respiratory mechanism, sneezing, and swelling; the surgeon's scalpel should be slightly raised because if lowered it leads to weakening of the heart and stomach.
Regarding the scalpel for oblique incisions, it benefits from treating acute headaches and swelling, as well as epilepsy, dizziness, toothache relief, and not causing bloodletting; the surgeon should be commanded not to insert the blade deeply so as not to cut a bleeding vessel.
Regarding the scalpel under the clamp, it benefits from treating abscesses in the mouth and tooth decay and other diseases of the mouth; its forceps can also remove a cyst that is present at the gums. Meanwhile, the double-ended scalpel benefits from treating swelling due to inflammation and heat.
Regarding the size of Zindi's abdomamal veins, they are effective as those that drain the three slender veins (the saphenous, popliteal, and femoral) because they attract blood from all these thin veins located in the muscle tissue and draw those slender veins away from other thicker vessels until the attraction reaches the three robust veins.
It is incumbent upon the surgeon to ensure that he does not cut in this area because it is a reddish spot on the muscle with nerves and blood vessels underneath, and the single swollen one located at the joints benefits from hemorrhoids and perianal abscesses.
It is incumbent upon the surgeon to ensure that the swelling is large and cylindrical because the location requires stronger forces, as the glass pipe may have burst or been severely constrained, while the swellings on both legs are reduced significantly in size.
It attracts blood from the entire body and is beneficial for chronic conditions in the kidneys, ureters, gallbladcuh, facilitates menstruation, treats bleeding and varicose veins, and serves as a drainage point for the saphenous and femoral veins except that it exhausts the body greatly and causes edema in many people, while swellings on both legs are nearly as effective as those on the legs.
How to Place the Syrinx and Firstly to Prepare an Empty Cylinder, Dip It with a Moderate Stroke, Do Not Extend The Placing of the Syrinx but Place it Quickly and Withdraw it Quickanguishingly so That It Absorbs All Mixtures in a Level Position and Repeat this Process Until You See that the Position Has Turned Red and Open.
Then when the blood turned red, press it quickly and return the cylinder to check on the condition of the wound; whoever was skilled in removing fat from bones should have channeled it once without leaving any residue until the position is fully blanched.
The surgeon is ordered to widen the incision slightly and adjust the cylinder gently, moving it lightly; when the blood was thickened, it should be pressed twice: once to open a path for gentle bleeding of the blood and its contents during the first time, and on the second press, to drain the viscous blood.
If the blood was very thick, press a third time to reach full evacuation; in short, if we want to exit a little blood with one incision, we will achieve more significant bleeding with two incisions, and if we estimate that the blood is viscular.
It is proper to make a deep incision and stop at the depth of the skin only, using either cauterization or water when placing the lancet, as directed by the patient. If his skin is thick, hardened, rough, and with narrow pores.
It is proper to cauterize the incision sites with a double-ended scissor-type cautery, or in summer use khayr paste or blue ointn or sweet almond oil or pumpkin seed oil.
And if in winter, use foxglove paste or lily of the valley oil or violet oil or nightshade and similar ointments such as mirazanjoo paste or narcissus oil or balsam oil or pansy oil.
If the patient has wide pores and loose muscles, he should refrain from using ointments such as those mentioned above; instead, after lancing them, they should be washed with rose water or cold water or wild grape juice or pomegerry juice or fig juice among others. If his blood is excessively moist.
"Wash the gums with vinegar water or asafoetida and its like; if the plaque is thick, wash the gums with aged wine, marzenqush juice, boiled mustard seeds, or pomegranate rinds, among others. Caution should be taken regarding size in the bathroom and under the toilet.
"After exiting the bathroom, wait for an hour or two and do not sleep after washing; it is necessary to cleanse with a comb both before and after washing.
"First, determine if the patient or affected individual is pale with a weak pulse and inflammation; it should be advised to take purgatives such as pomegranate rinds, fenugreek seeds, dill seeds, parsley, licorice, among others, and consume food like rice gruel, lamb meat broth, and almond milk in a similar manner.
"If his temperament is cool, it should be recommended to drink honey wine or almond fenugreek seeds and consume medium-aged aromatic wine that lies between old and new; advise small meals including rice gruel, khanapriya grains, roasted chicken broth, eggs poached in asafetida water, and ensure the drink is more than food on the day of purging.
It has been deemed necessary to administer, at certain times, the antimony-based ointment or mercury medicine or scillitus before surgery and before suturing and after it to strengthen vital organs and stimulate blood flow; however, it should not be applied by inexperienced individuals.
As for the unconditional battles, which are applied to the liver, gallbladhemoth and glands, as well as the abdomen, urethra, kidney position, and joints, since these parts do not tolerate exceptions; they only serve to attract blood from one part of the body to another.
We place the ointment on the limbs in cases of cold, stagnant blood that has accumulated within a part; or we use it to draw out humors from a body part. If placed on the abdomen and urethra, it causes inflammation, warmness, and pain, which facilitates its dissolution.
Placed on the kidneys if there is a stone or sediment causing obstruction, it may cause the passage to open or remove the stone; similarly, when applied to the liver and gallbladder during agitation caused by wind in these organs, this ointment works purely through its application.
The fire has been used and a vessel filled with water, which is placed on the scales, so that it fills up and becomes large with hot water alone or with boiled water in which some herbs have been cookeby.
Then the vessel is placed on the spot and held firmly, repeated as necessary, which is an image of the vessel used with fire:.
Its mouth is depicted as being two open fingers wide, its depth half a thumb in length, and on either side at about one-third of the way down there are small holes for inserting iron (either Chinese or yellow copper) with thick edges.
A leather pouch that causes injury when placed on it and contains a fulcrum made of iron or copper where the wick is positioned for fire, this vessel can be larger than what was described but smaller as needed according to diseases.
We shall use it as follows: boys' and maidens' scales, not men's scales and body weights, for placing the vessel with fire on a part of the body is to have a wick inserted from cotton or small oil by threading through the reinforced pin in the middle of the scale.
To raise the fire to above the amputation point so that the body of the patient does not burn, then place on the limb and finger on the hole which we mentioned until it grasps what we pulled out with our fingers.
The steam comes out of that hole and the tumor dissolves on its spot, then the string is pulled on the wound and reinserted if it pulls back to it; as for the tumor which uses water in a sores disease, there is no solid stick and no hole.
But it is used to be filled with water and placed on the limb only, here is her image:.
And this tumor is always large to let in a lot of water and was the best,,.
The seventh section nineteen.
In the note on the vesicle.
The bladder, in fact, is used in most cases on limbs where it is not possible to place the tumor either because they are small like skin and hair or similar and when the part is colored with meat such as fingers and nose and similar ones.
And how to use it so that the bladamo be in pure clear water from ailments, then leave one day and night in the water until thirsty with nothing left in its stomach. Then the body first empties by straining or purging, and then cleanses the affected limb.
Until the blood is heated, then it is placed on top if necessary after dripping. If possible to mash the spot with a pestle, this will be beneficial; otherwise, wash the area with urine and plenty of water, dissolve and knead until bleeding occurs due to dropping of the clot and flows like drip seepage through a tear in cloth into cold water.
It is placed on top until the bleeding stops, then dried powder or lint and similar things from bandages are used until the blood ceases or it is placed back on the spot after being pounded into a paste.
It is left until the paste sticks to the spot, then it should be ensured that no clots are reapplied if possible, as unremoved clots will cause bleeding by scraping the area with blood.
Or a needle is inserted into the spot until something of blood comes out, then it is placed if there is sensation of some blood sticking to the site and if you wish for something to fall on it, drop anything from asafoetida or salt or powdered lead onto the site.
Chapter eby three
In algebra.
This chapter also discusses what is needed in the field of medicine, including fraction algebra and fracture reduction in bones.
Be aware, O my son, that this chapter may be deemed foolish by doctors and laymen alike, as not a single page has been reviewed or a word read from it.
And for this reason, this science has become obsolete in our country and no improvement has been made on it yet. However, many have used it as they have read the books of early times and tried to understand them, then extracting knowledge from them through experience and practice over time.
And from this, you have in this chapter everything I encompassed with my knowledge. I have refined it after bringing it closer to you, distilled from the generality of elongation and condensed down to the essence, clarifying to a degree that everything is explained. And in it, you will find many illustrations using the tools pictured which are used within.
Thus, it is an increase in explanation as I did in the previous chapters, with no power except for God's greatness,...
Chapter amo: On General Surgery Principles and Preparation for Treatment
Chapter: In cases of tooth fractures and dislocation, it is necessary to mention them one by one in this section with respect to the tongue and chapters. First, it requires you to understand and acknowledge the truth that you were keen on learning this honorable profession.
I say that when one suffers a fracture or dislocation, it is necessary first to stop bleeding or swelling or protrusion entirely. It is not prevented by something such as weak strength or if it happened to someone like a boy, an elderly person, during extreme heat or extreme cold severely.
Then it restricts its diet to cold porridge, chicken meat, and vegetables, avoiding alcohol and fatty meats, overeating, and any food that fills the abdomen with blood until a tumor forms and does not expect tissue repositioning.
At that time, the patient should return to their first form of treatment if they took a fractured tooth as part of an amalgam; it is necessary for them to eat foods rich in heavy and dense nutrients like jellyfish, rice, heads, kidneys, and ox shin bones. By using eggs, dried fish, thick syrup, and the like, it is with this care that the healing process becomes faster and better; know that broken bones in elderly men do not always reconnect and consolidate as they first should.
For their bone deformities and weakness, they may reconnect and consolidate as thin young bones would, but the nature of a broken bone sprouts from all parts in something like tough scar tissue that clings to it and tightens until it fuses with one another.
They fuse with one another until they reach strength and solidity as originally, so nothing impedes their actions.
For this reason, the patient's diet must be nutritious and dense as we mentioned; understand that fractures may vary in type depending on which body part is broken because a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone differs from a fracture of the back.
Similarly, each body part differs from the other, and we will come to discuss every type of fracture in detail separately, as the nature of bone fractures can also vary within themselves.
Because it might be a bone fracture without splinters, or a longitudinal fracture of the bone with fragments being separated and not separated, and such a break is accompanied by a wound and laceration in the skin and the fracture is moving.
For each type of characteristic in the bone's fracture, which will be mentioned in detail at its place, it is identified as a displaced bone fracture with protrusion and appearance on touch and rattling when tapped by your hand.
When there is no displacement, appearance, or rattling upon tapping the bone and it does not cause much pain without a palpable fracture, but may be a stable, hairline, or moving fracture that should not be moved by stretching or tapping.
Take him the medications that are mentioned after agreeing with the place, then hold him firmly but gently, and know that if the bone is fractured or crushed into two without causing splinters, it may be that each part has completely separated from its owner.
It is fitting for you to perceive from your side and correct it before a hot abscess occurs, if a hot abscess occurs, it swells you by days until the hot abscess settles then treat it with whatever face of medicine and expediency you deem suitable.
Know that healing and correcting a bone fracture is easier than one with shards, then it strengthens what will come to mind regarding this, as the bone had shards which should not be extended from the length of the broken part from both sides hands or legs.
Whether by hand or two ropes, or with the rope and your hand, place the bone on its natural upper position until the broken bone shard extends, then straighten those shards in their places by any face of medicine and expediency you deem suitable.
Ensure that you do not cause pain and ache to the patient or include your abscess with one of the bones alongside it in the best possible form, at this time you should feel them and palpate them by your hand as you see there is something abnormal to correct and treat according to your strength.
"Be cautious with severe tension and exertion, as many unskilled individuals do frequently cause this and apply heat or during a period of inflammamoins in the limb as you may have seen from their actions causing pus.
"Then, following reconciliation and consolidation of the tissue, he would ensure that the limb remains still during wakefulness and sleep, as well as during movement or disturbance and when burping and in all extremes, expansion and sweating to maintain a pain relief by securing the limb.
"That is, when he feels pain in a limb that does not transmit to another part without sensation and sweats with it for the afflicted part to be straightened.
"So that if a deformity occurs in the limb, understand how to tension a broken bone as I have described for you; know that the severed parts vary by size and age, such as arms and fingers and vertebrae.
"The flaps of the incision should be tensioned to the underlying fascia, and those with thickness like thighs, backs, and chests should have firm edges so that the flat piece does not require a tight wrap, as the wide band requires large limbs and pulls them evenly from all sides without slippage.
Then begin after the gap from smoothing by applying the agreed paint. In a soft ligature at the location of the incision, then start wrapping bandages around that same spot for three turns or four depending on the severamen and slightly press with your hand using the bandage; go upwards from the site of the cut.
Then slightly less pressure at the location of the incision, then move away from the site of the cut and loosen up a bit more until you take something suitable; also, another bundle is twisted on the place of the cut.
Then go down with the bandage to the lower side of the cut and your action should be in wrapping and loosening as mentioned previously when you wrapped the first upper turn; then place between the pads of the soft ligature or torn, depending on what suffices for the distortion of the incision.
If there is distortion and not, then make another twist on it; then smooth out the tightened turns for a minute from your hour if they are not bulging or inflamed.
Then there was a tube or an inflamed tumor filled with whatever causes that tumor, which would go in by blowing into it and be left for days; then the tubes were tied off at one end, when this happened the other end of the pipes were made from halves of cut-up and wisely treated reed.
Those made from reeds or palm leaves, or like it, as their size matches the image and this shape with its eye.
But that the tube placed on its own is thicker and slightly more prominent than other tubes, and as for the length of the tube it was made according to what corresponds in size with the severed part from largest to smallest, image of the tube:.
Then tie off other tubes with a bundle as per its first knot according to our mentioned tying method so that the knots are on top of tightly pulled strings and positioned at where the cut is located. And after mentioning the cut, its binding was less firm.
The strings should be of medium thickness and softness, and the threads used must be wet because if the strings are as rough as the workman's cloths that he tightens them with is a big mistake.
Because it is too strong and the fine threads do not work, as you do not achieve what you want with this strength, and it should not be less than between two nails.
Because the wound is irritated by the ends of the nails after applying the pressure, make a light bandage or gauze underneamenet so that it does not get hurt from that, and as for if there is a cut with a skin crack and a laceration on the skin has occurred, we will mention him in the individual case.
And know that not every broken bone should be compressed with nails from the first day, and if it is a large one, it is not appropriate to place pins on it except after five or seven days or more according to your discretion due to inflammation.
This is the general bandage that compels a fracture and union, it hastens more healing than most ointments and especially in boys and women as it does not get infected or cold easily.
It is to take dust from the mill and apply it to the fine flour in which the millstone moves, without allowing it to escape with egg whites, making it neither too coarse nor too fine.
The last dressing that forces the rupture, suppuration, and scabbing takes from fat, lamb wool yogurt, quince gum, frankincense, and myrrh ten drams each and one dram of saffron and six drams of pounded cuttlebone or Roman clay two hundred drams. Grind all together and mix with myrrh water or egg whites if the patient's condition is severe, then this dressing is an effective adhesive that forces fractured bones to heal quickly and is more beneficial for most people.
The last dressing that also helps fractures and scabbing takes frankincense, fat, white lamb yogurt ten drams each, one dram of saffron, six drams of quince gum, twenty drams of Roman clay, grinds all together finely, strains, kneads with water or egg whites, and uses.
"Preparation of a bandage for joints and absent bones in their places, which settles the pain and fractures of them. Soak the gauze soaked with vinegar and heated oil on it, place it at the location.
"However, it is superior in healing heat-induced swelling and pushing specific ailments. Another bandage preparation forces the broken bone to unite, takes deafening mulberry leaves and raw flaxseeds and grinds them all up, then applies them moistened with both. Another condensed bandage is used for treating fractures.
"To treat the rest of the swelling, you take from the essence of alum and boron and indigo powder and carmine dust in equal parts grind them all finely and mold it with paint if the part is not detached then it was attached and paste it with saffron water or water.
"Another stronger bandage preparation for this initial analysis is used when a hard swelling occurs upon fracture unification, takes from the essence of alum and pumpkin seeds and beet juice and royal jelly and ginger and indigo powder and boron from each one part.
All are dried and kneaded with decoction of henbane or with pure water or varnish, depending on the heat and stillness of the part, but what to do with fractures is not mentioned in his book.
Except for albucasis's lint made of resin and oil, which is not described as a mixture between paste and powder, Galen has placed it on the fractured part along with things like decoctions containing substances similar to mercury, patience, milk, etc.
A poultice that relieves lightness and pain, takes bryony root and onion juice with human hair or bird feathers, eyebrows, and salt in equal parts to knead into a paste, leaving the bandage on for the appropriate duration.
Thus, he asserts that if there is no illness or inflammation and the broken bone has not moved from its place, it will not move days without having happened to it in its place resulting in severe stinging or debilitating pain.
Begin by not delaying that moment and removing the bandage from it, then take a soft gauze or wet washcloth dipped in lukew지 هدر فالميزون بليغوجير الموضع حتى يسكن الوجع ثم تترك الأعضاء للاستراحة لساعة.
Then he places the swab soaked in broth, or oil, or grape pitch on it and ties it to him overnight until the tumor is secured by the warmness of the member and nestles into the flesh, then returns to gentle traction with a slow compress and does not tighten the first bandage.
Then he pats it until relief, and I observed that the tumor, redness, pain, swelling, and all symptoms had disappeared, so they returned to bandaging and traction as initially done; nothing happened in the member as we previously mentioned.
It should not be removed except after three days, four days, five days or seven; it may remain up to twenty days depending on how the member appears as we said until if necessary cut and rejoin of the muscle.
He also tightened the traction more than initially and increased the nourishment for the patient as previously mentioned, I observed that the location of the incision had shrunken and trembled beyond what is necessary; know that food has been withheld from it.
"Soak the fracture with warm water every time you change it, and do this for three days; then slightly reduce the tightness, as by doing so the flesh is nourished and quickly healed, but what is created by ignorant pressers who break the bone again.
"If they did not do what is proper and broke on a bend, it was their mistake and a great deception, even if what the ancients wrote in their books and practiced and you saw one of them perform this technique. "And the correct view that it does not work with,
"The second chapter.
"In the deformity of a fracture in the head.
"There are many types of deformity fractures in the head, with different forms and reasons, as it may be due to a sword strike causing all the bone to break and end up at an angle undernelevation. "As does splinting in wood," (This instruction seems incomplete or incorrectly copied, as it lacks context for a proper translation.)
"Therefore, this type of fracture is called 'splinting' and may be a sword cut through part of the bone only with an angle change on its face without extending to another piece; hence it is also called an outright severance, and these two types of fractures are either large or small.
The missing or injured part is due to being struck by a stone, falling on a stone, or something similar; this fracture may be either near the window that has hit under the bone covering or it may be on the face of the bone.
Both of these fractures may also be either large or small, and one type of the fracture is hidden within the bone in the hairline and it extends upward.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called hairline, and it can be a crack from falling or something similar that enters the bone sheet internally and extends to the place where it breaks as an iron piece would show if struck by entering any part of it inside.
It is more so in the moist bone of young children's skulls, and all these types of fractures may have either clear or unclear fragments, and it has been noted that treating them all together at their location; we identify all these types by exposing them.
To examine them, one must remove any spoiled meat over it, and the hairline type is recognized by exposing the bone and covering and staining it with plaster, so that the fracture appears black; however, when treating the fracture, first look at the symptoms of the disease.
Indeed, from its symptoms one can infer a sign of fear such as sweating profusebuilding up and fleeing the mind, cessation of speech, fainting, severe chills, constricted pupils turning red with these signs there is no approach to treatment nor healing for it often leads to death.
And if you see symptoms that do not cause alarm or fear then proceed with his treatment as it may be the initial injury occurred in winter days.
It was necessary to extract the bone before the fourth day in all cases and if it is during summer days, then speed up the extraction of the bnz before the seventh day before the tissue under the bone gets infected presenting these symptoms that we described.
The bone fracture reached the covering on the brain and came with numbness and relaxation it was necessary to cut the part that is numb as described to you, which is a tumor of the injurious condition in the head.
The bone is exposed on any face that you can manage depending on the form of the wound and what is hidden within the injury, when revealed to you at exposing a bone bleeding or hot pus occurs as it should.
He is to fill the site with a pressed plaster soaked in olive oil, rosewater, and wound juice until the tumor settles and the bleeding stops; then he takes the bone saw and extracts it from one of the two methods used.
The one method is to cut the bone with a fine saw blade as shown in this image:
Then he uses another type shown here a little after the previous cut as depicted in this image:
Finally, he also uses another type as shown in the second one and it must have several different saws with some being longer than others and varying by a few cuts; they are made of high-quality steel or iron.
The assistant used the mallet on the saw to ensure it does not shake or damage the head; as the bone was strong and solid, it needed to be drilled around it before using your saws with blades that are non-jagged but rather smooth and precise.
Because it does not exceed the length of the femur bone to avoid giving the drill a curved edge on what is beyond for a smooth finish that prevents the drill from piercing and overextending into the marrow cavity, similar to preventing plunging or circumventing the tip.
It is necessary for you to take from these pincers several times, so that each one fixes the bone as much as a honeycomb of that bone until it reaches every joint pincer in length and shortens by about the thickness of that joint. This is an image of three types. From large to medium-sized to small pincers:.
How to drill around a broken bone is for you to place the pincer on the bwokin and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has moved then move the pincer to another location and make room as thick as the pus or so.
Then you cut between both pincers and do that as much as possible within your ability as we said until you remove the bone either by hand or another tool from those mentioned above.
Like a small bowl and ladle, be careful to ensure that the pincer or cutter does not come into contact with any part of the flap, if you tighten it and separate from the flap should happen that it is attached and remove him in it must be cleaned up. (Translation for this sentence can vary as medical terms may have different equivalents depending on context.)
The bone's sharp edge was smoothed with another tool similar to the previous one, but it should be thinner and more gentle; thus, something from small bones and fragments were carefully taken by you using your tools.
Then the wound is treated afterwards with a ligature and bandages as mentioned by him, while the other face of the work is easy to comprehend, far from Gallonus whom he praised immensely, this is his saying. You should first begin by exposing the bone part from the position where the fracture occurred, being the closest and most prominent until that part is exposed, then the reflective side of this section appeared below it as depicted in his image:.
The reflective part of it is smooth and uncut, while the sharp end from its edges are lengthwise as you see to make the reflective side resemble a square jaw, then strike on the section with one hand.
With a small mallet until all bones are cut off carefully as it rotates, and you're under the cover where no accident of hitting occurs for fear of concussion; even if the person being treated is unknown to people or they have responded him yes or no, whether he be drunk.
Indeed, a condition must be removed from the bone in certain positions of the bone; it is excised by the edge of the same lens and eliminated gently because it easily dissolves without harm or fear.
And if the bone fracture was not excised to the periosteum and there is a protrusion from the bone with roughness and splinters of lamina, it should be cleaned by taking off those rough pieces and removing the splinters using scissors. You can take several different sizes of blades from them so you can use any according to each place and fix it as needed depending on what guides you in your work.
And the same broken bone and its form, you should first use rougher blades on it, then use finer ones until you can fully utilize them all in a smooth manner. Continue this process faithfully until you have used the most refined and delicate ones.
And for small scaly abscesses and fine fractures, each should be treated with one method according to its suitability, which is not hidden from anyone experienced in this field; it's a minimum of the training that we have written down and stated in our texts on major breaks.
Indeed, once the covering is exposed after removing your skull bone, it was appropriate to take a piece of cloth on the wound and dip it in rose oil, then place it over the wound, followed by taking another two-layered or triangular piece. Then dip it in wine and rose oil, place it over the first cloth, and create that as much as possible to avoid burdening the sutured wound; then use a wide ribbon from above without tightening it more than what the wound can hold.
And with this treatment, leave it for a day or two until the tumor subsides; then remove it and use afterward the medicines accompanying it such as boiled senecio roots, wheatgrass powder, candelilla resin powder, Indian frankincense, etc., making these from said medicines.
And allow it to dry completely and in short, use a medicine whose purpose is cleansing without irritation; scrub diligently while treating your wound so that it remains clean with no grease or stickiness, and there's no accumulation of dust.
Because if a swelling comes together on the brain's membrane, it corrupts and rots it; this causes a great illness in the patient, which may be seen at the temples when the bone opens up, especially if neglected in treatment.
The darkening on its surface indicates the manifestation of an illness we have mentioned before, which I know is incurable; and if the pallor occurred because of a drug placed upon it, then that drug was strong enough to cause such pallor.
It was proper to take part of honey and three parts of rose oil, pound them well together, spread a cloth with them, place it on the temples, and treat it with types of treatment that should last until recovery is achieved.
The third section.
The nose must be fixed if broken.
Know that the nose does not break except by its upper parts all at once or one of them, because from below it is a cartilage that cannot be broken and only shows redness, swelling, and cracking.
If one of the breaks occurs, it is proper to insert your little finger into the nose's hole and smooth that broken part from inside with your ring finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural form; do so gently so as not to cause further damage to the illness or pain.
He had a cut at the upper part of the nose, and it was not possible to touch upon it directly with the finger; therefore, he should have slightly swolannoated both sides, and then acted on the first day after the injury.
After the seventh or tenth day, once the abscess has cooled down, then insert a thin quill from chicken feather in the nostril if the cut is on one side, or two thin quills if the cut is on both sides.
The quill should be thick enough to reach the nostril opening, some early practitioners advised oiling the feather and changing it every day; however, I find that rubbing the quill with eggs whites mixed with hen dander is more appropriate.
Then leave the quill until the bone is established and the skin is healed; then insert pigeon feather tubes in the nostril after a slight tear has allowed it to securely hold the nasal fracture, preventing the wound from breathing if possible.
This is not necessary if you have done it or made the fettuccine, during your treatment of an abscess present exposing the nose to be filled with quinine pills or a turtle stuffed in vinegar and oil, or something from diaphoretic substances.
Indeed, the hot sores should not be dressed from outside with wheat starch and almonds pounded then applied a soft bandage that does not tie to anything hard, so that the nasal bones break into small pieces.
Or it flared up and should be opened with the appropriate instrument that heals then sews the incision, using what cauterizes and sutures from approved leather straps, so that an internal nasal wound to treat is handled with a plaster and glass pipes are used. Until healed.
Chapter Four.
The under lip was fractured.
If the lower lip is fractured and not accompanied by an open wound, then its breakage was only external and did not involve two pieces splitting and crumbling inside, making it easier to identify.
It should be that the break on the right side allows insertion of a probe from the left hand into the mouth of the ill and similarly, if the break is on the left side, it should allow entry of the probe with the right hand while lifting the bone fragment gently from inside to outside.
The other side of the bone outside the skull is controlled by its setting, and if the fracture was to be shortened by two inches, it should use the splint from both sides until the setting takes place; in some teeth, over-setting occurred.
He takes out the splint and leaves a gold or silver wire or platinum, then places it on the broken gums, followed by placing double sutures on it, and finally applies a large tight ligature or leather strip equal to the length of the gum. Then it is fastened on top as you deem appropriate for its attachment and secured until there is no movement, and the patient is instructed to avoid talking and be quiet and make his/her soft diet, I thought that something might change in appearance due to this by the third day.
Then it is fastened on top as you deem appropriate for its attachment and secured until there is no movement, and the patient is instructed to avoid talking and be quiet and make his/her soft diet, I thought that something might change in appearance due to this by the third day. Then it is treated with olive oil pus mixed with egg white or fine wheat flour after removing the sutures from it, and a soft bandage is placed on it; that dressing was kept on him and there were no changes in his bone condition.
Do not heal until it has become open and the wound becomes more severe, within three weeks of which a hot paste was applied to its base as we have mentioned in our treatment.
If the wound is accompanied by a visible bone fragment, then it may have protruded or protrusions that can be removed from the affected area as you deem appropriate; then gradually enlarge the hole with forceps according to your need.
Then if the fragments have been removed and there is nothing left in the wound but a large one, then wear on it with one of the dressings mentioned to heal that. And sew up the wound until it heals.
The fifth chapter.
It is necessary to reopen if there is a rupture. (This text appears to be incomplete or missing parts; the translation may not fully capture the intended meaning due to possible omissions in the provided excerpt.)
The more the incision ruptures from near its end and it breaks, being on one of three sides: either it splits and divides into two without bone fragments occurring in it or it is easier to repair. (This text also appears to be incomplete; however, a complete translation has been provided based on the available information.)
If the break occurs in a bone, it is more difficult to manage; or if the fracture is with a wound, then work on it as follows: boil two forks to soften them and use one to raise the displaced fragment and the other to stabilize the adjacent portion.
Then smooth out the fracture with your forks until it forms properly and has no gaps or misalignment; then apply more paste as necessary under the bandage made of cloth or gauze.
The bone should be raised and lengthened as much as possible by your hand until the fracture sets correctly; if it cannot pull the displacement outwards to reach the desired depth, then the injury must be elevated on a sling.
Place a mid-size cushion under the bone, and fix the handle with your hand pointing downwards until it rises to bring the displaced bone up; then you will be able to mend and smooth out the fracture with your forcks.
I feel that a fragment of the fracture has broken off and started to move as it should, causing the fragment to gouge out with its movement; if the fragment was lodged in the bone and then separated from the section that was split by cutting through it, thus making it loose. After the urine vessel comes into position, there is a device that collects urine; it may be made of wood or iron and this was its appearance:
It resembles a cup without handles, and its size depends on the bone length required; also, its width is determined by what can be worked with, having two ends as you see one end wider and the other narrower.
It was a laceration from extracting your bone shard which is wide, and the hot tumor had swolprise encompassed the wound with stitches; if it were to progress or fear the hot tumor would burst the wound through tearing.
It is the appearance of a hot tumor when it tears in olive oil or vinegar, and also if you carry it, provided that the bone fragment is not injured nor torn; then it should be carried on the bone plug with lime from sweepings mixed with egg whites. Then, you place the bandage gently on it; if needed then put a ball underneath his sling and the size is like a span or so and take two stitches for both the splint and plaster, then use silk thread to sew. The presentation of it with three fingers and the same length, then insert it into a hole, then place that hole with scissors in the position where the clamp is located on the incision site, then hold the clamp at the incision as if spinning. Wrap it around the neck and under its proper clamp and under the patient's clamp, repeat this on each side, and as you see, tightening adjusts the incision snugly secure.
And he assured that the scissors did not touch the broken bone. Therefore, the patient should be examined daily once the sutures have loosened and you see that the scissors are no longer needed to repair it, then tighten the bandage again and make the patient rest on his back during the day and at night cover his clamp with a small pad.
Raise the limb at an equal height to its opposite side, with a fracture of dislocation elevated by neck flexion, and do not untie the sutures unless there has been no accident from scratching or wound infection for twelve days.
Then replace the bandage if you find that due to this. He makes a ligature at the site of tension and leaves it until the constriction breaks, and becomes stronger than before in eighty-two days. In some people, this may occur sooner.
Chapter Six.
The fracture occurs in the forearm. If it breaks at a more extended part from there, then firstly its fingers break, and if they break at the mid-part or center of it, this is known by touching according to the shape of the fracture.
He arranges it as naturally as possible on its proper form, then takes it to the spot with lime plaster mixed with egg white and fine gauze, placing a mould made of two joined cloths over it, and finally covers it with an external splint.
The gauze is applied over the entire forearm or slightly wider, underneath the splint to support all positions of the forearm so that when the splint is lowered with fine silk, it rests at a level, and then it's tied above long bandages.
Tie the splint firmly and ensure its stability, inspecting the bindings daily or when they loosen. If possible, tighten them again and adjust the splint if it shifts from its position; keep the injury properly aligned throughout the healing process of twenty days.
On the fifth or twentiamoon day, if all these symptoms have completed and you are certain of them, that it is from the bone such that there is no fever or swelling, then a splinter will protrude through the skin and spread beneath the skin until he pulls it out. And create what you mentioned in the surgical intervention of removing a malignant tumor, if something like that occurs, then...
The seventh section.
Surgery of cutting the chest.
The chest may break in the middle, and this will be slightly visible, but its sides are more likely to crack and collapse; and as a symptom if it breaks in the middle tending downward, exposing itself, there will be severe pain and difficulty breathing.
And sometimes blood may be present and the fracture of the broken bone will not be concealed from touch, forcing it to rise with a swelling on its shoulder which is wrapped between its shoulders, then encircles at its forearm and gathers the limbs together by both hands and stretches as much as possible.
And once the bone has returned to its proper form, then carry a bandage and plaster on it as per the assistant's instructions from pincers or tweezeboards or other tools at hand, placing them gently over it after having caused damage by cutting into it. Then gently wrap it on the fractured bone so that it does not slip, pass the bandage along towards the back several times and tighten it firmly, then check the bandage at every time, and as long as you loosen it.
And if the need arises to remove it when a swelling or pain is visible, detach the bandage and treat what was revealed as treating with regard to its healing, then reapply the bandamoadly. If you see this for that reason. And apply and press until it is relieved.
Chapter Eight.
The fracture of the limbs should be treated if they are broken, knowing that only the break occurs in them on elevated locations and their edges, from behind primarily because it heals by being wrapped and this is recognized through touch during examination with fingers.
Treat them to be wrapped with fingers on the face until they take the right shape, then dress and tighten the fractured bone with a bandage if you need it; being a break of the limbs inclined inward is characterized by severe pain.
And the first [thing] which presents itself to one who has a headache for the purpose that bone diminishes the covering and also causes shortness of breath, sneezing, heavy bleeding, and this is the difficulty of treatment, and the early physicians have been deceived greatly by it.
From them it was said that one should make the food of the disease generate inflation and winds to cause the abdomen to swell, expand, and push tumors outward, which we call "tumescence" in the occurrence of a hot tumor if not occurred then it would have happened, but it increases in him and emphasizes it.
And some of them placed a tumor and squeezed it strongly, which is similar to measurement but he fears that the tumor will draw impotence towards the position due to weakness; and some said one should cover the position with gauze soaked in hot oil.
And a tumor becomes full in the space between the ribs to fill out the girdle, if it is bent around; then treat the disease with diet and medicine, as the afflicted tumor is very severe and unbearable. The bone is the first to be relieved by the screen, which we are concerned about in the illness that it should be punctured at the place and uncovered the broken limb then replaced with the apparatus below which preserves the tissue and brings forth, and cuts the bone gently and removes it.
Then we gather the skin of the wound if it is large with stitches and treat it until it heals, in which case a warm ointer will be applied on aloen oil at the place and the illness treated so as to eliminate the tumor from within also.
And it is covered on the side where he sleeps until he recovers, and... (Please note that this translation seems to be incomplete or incorrect as there might be missing context or a possible misinterpretation of the original Arabic text.)
The ninth chapter. (This is assumed to be a section title from Albucasis's book, and hence translated directly without additional information.)
It is necessary to pierce the chest and neck. (Again, this translation assumes it is a section heading or an instruction from Albucasis's text on surgery procedures, translated directly as such.)
As for the bones of the neck if they are fractured and stopped it shows more than what is shown by relief but also the thoracic ribs if this is presented to someone whether he wants them to recover or not. (This translation assumes that it's a detailed instruction from Albucasis regarding treatment outcomes based on symptoms, translated directly with no additional context provided.) Behold, I saw his hands that they had become relaxed and numb and died, unable to move or stretch or grasp, and if you prick or pinch them with a needle he does not feel it and finds no pain in them; therefore, I know he is beyond recovery in most cases.
If he moves them and feels the prick or pinch with a needn, I know that the bone marrow has subsided and the illness is recovering; one was afflicted in the same way and I wondered if he would also recover.
I saw him, and his hands had relaxed; then what happens in the hands occurred to him: he would vomit from a spontaneous burst without intent when lying on his back, and if something fell onto his abdardum involuntary urination ensued. If something fell onto his back and he desired to urinate but couldn't, I know that he is beyond cure because nothing from this has been shown; the situation was worse, but treating it caused tumor pacification in warm cancer cases.
Place on the inflamed vertebrae rose oil alone or with boiled egg white three times during the day until the tumor becomes warm at the site of one of the strengthened and dried compresses, wrap it with a bandage and instruct to rest and remain still.
He should not rest unless he is pain-free, and if a crack or something like that occurred at the bone during relief, it was necessary to scrape off the skin and remove that bone. Then collect the sutures of the wound if it is large with thread then treat with compresses until healing, otherwise break another vertebra and enter the humerus deficiency through the left hand into the socket.
Align the broken bone with the other hand as best possible, and wait until it is stabilized then apply a plaster cast or brace if necessary, then fasten (the device).
I felt a sharp break in it, so removed and treated the wound with care until healed.
Chapter cuatrocientos (Section 10)
Section X: Fracture of the shaft.
A fracture of the shaft means that if the bones of the leg are broken, it is a separation at the ends and longitudinal cracking, leaning inward and displaying signs of pain at the site, along with swelling and coolness, radiating from where the break occurred.
He will bend your hand over it until you stand on the fracture as is, if the fracture was only at the ends just level that break above according to how you feel from the healing, until it resembles its natural shape.
The fracture was along the length or it had penetrated inward, causing inflammation on its surface until you are accustomed to bending that break, if you have healed it and then put a load on it with bandages, then apply casts made of wood or leather, tighten them.
Do not fear the shift of the fracture or the loss of casts, smooth out any swelling with what fills it until taking the pressure back to normal and instructing the injury to rest on its back or the correct side so that they exhibit a warmth.
Loosen the bandage and stretch it until the hot tumor settles in; then return to boring it, tighten it as necessary. If an outbreak occurs on the bone, cracks or fragments may occur, which should not be allowed to happen.
It does not overstep, but rather goes beyond as we said, leaving it tightened until healed.
Surgical Section X.
In the surgery of bone fracture.
The bone is connected from the elbow to the neck; if it fractures on one of two heads, take a curved splint placed in the middle thickness as shown in this image:.
It is then secured on both ends with two ties, and hangs from a high point while the patient sits in a chair; the fractured arm is placed on the splint until it sets firmly at the center of the curve, after which something heavy is hung over it.
Or it is lengthened by a weight to the bottom, and the doctor straightens the fracture with both hands until the break aligns properly; on the other hand, let the patient lean back on their elbows while hanging the arm from the neck held by ties.
Then command the servants to adjust one of them above the fracture with their hands and the other below it, stretching each one towards themselves; if they wanted a stronger pull, they tied ropes underne cuffs and pulled on them from both sides.
The fracture was close to the lateral side, so it was appropriate for one rope to be placed underneath the cuff and the other underneath the fracture towards the joint; likewise, if the fracture was close to the joint, it was suitable for the rope to be on that position and on the joint itself.
Then the fracture was gently realigned until it reached its proper position and a good union formed; then it was tightened if there was no inflamed swelling, but if an inflamed swelling appeared, apply pressure to reduce the swelling on the seventh day and cover it with a moistened bandage soaked in vinegar.
Until the swelling subsided, then tighten it so that the dressing is on the fracture and wrap a new gauze over the dresser; then gather the arm around itself at the joint and place his hand open on its elbow.
The tear and tension on the ligament and forearm allows the arm to act as a lever for prosthesis, provided that nothing prevents it from doing so due to a broken bone or if such injury does not alter your structure, then you should proceed with fitting the prosthesis.
It is that you place on the fracture itself a prosthesis that is more prominent and stronger than all other prostheses, making each one finger-width apart, with the length of the prostheses according to the wound increased by three fingers from each side.
Then grip tightly on the prostheses with the pressure mentioned in Chapter One.
And it is that your grip on the fracture site be stronger.
And after the fracture has healed, if your grip is weaker, then place and apply pressure to the prostheses as we instructed in Chapter One of your body part for an hour.
And if you are afraid of the hot tumor, apply the grip and prostheses as we instructed on Day Seven. Then inspect the sutures every three days so that nothing happens at the site such as swelling or inflammation or restriction in accessing food to allow everything to heal completely as mentioned above.
Indeed, I am confident that nothing of the sort will occur; the suture shall not dissolve except after many days, and the swelling at the site of the illness on its head, hand, and attached to it under a bundle filled with moderate wool.
And at any time during the night or day, without delay, break the shape of the broken bone or loosen the suture; repair it all with your effort, and put food on the table we provided so that the nourishment is mild initially until their bones have become firm again.
It should be that his food is made heavier, for the limb and leg usually become firm in forty days; then it dissolves and becomes functional with the bandage provided to heal such a grievous fracture.
It does not dissolve within fifty days or two months,
The second decade.
In the case of a forearm fracture.
The arm is fractured from two bones and are called the zanjidin; one of them smaller, which leads to the thumb, while the other is larger, situated beneath it on its lower side. If only the larger fracture occurs or only the smaller one does, they may sometimes break simultaneously.
When the upper small joint is fractured, its union is easy and bleeding fast, but when the lower joint is fractwed, the rupture was poor and difficult to stop bleeding, especially if both bones were broken simultaneously, then it was the bone that broke the upper small joint.
It was necessary for the physician when fracturing it to make the duration of healing slow and careful so that the large joint was broken, if both were broken then it was necessary to make the duration of healing much stronger.
It was necessary to place the shape of the hand during fracturing and make its duration long on a bed, with the thumb up higher than all fingers and the index finger down lower than the rest of the fingers and the cast squarely propped upon itself.
And the bed should be placed flatly for it not to tilt the cast.
Then the arm servant is extended either from his hand or with a splint, and another servant is extended above that, then the physician aligns the bone until it can be set in the best possible shape, which was broken into fracture fragments.
The reaction to any splinter in its place is that a clean one appeared in it, which grazed the skin and did not cause pain at the site; he pulled it out on the same side as mentioned earlier, and then the cut was with the wound that we have described coming forward.
The treatment of that was taken from there, and the first swelling with a hot rash is pierced by vinegar used as an ointment made with rose oil and white wax, let it be moderated between honey and yogurt to tighten the piercing gently until it settles in.
Remove the vinegcuar and apply the pre-made ointment with ground henna mixed with egg white, then take bandages so that the plaster placed on the cut itself appears slightly more prominent and stronger, and know that in most cases, the number of arm plasters will be six.
The cut was in one or two fingers together, then make the pressure on the place of the cut stronger and firmer until you feel the pressure rising above or below as described at the beginning of this chapter.
To create a flexible wet incision where it is not overly rigid, use a thread from pure silk of medium thickness between soft and strong, as we have described, and examine the tissue and sutures after some days.
An event that requires healing, like a scratch on the tissue should be bathed in soothing water until it is fully absorbed and the tissue remains unrestricted overnight for rest before resuming activity.
It seems that the sutures have loosened and the bone has healed or almost so, fixing everything completely as you exerted yourself, and also note that if the food does not reach the tissue to avoid excessive strain, it should be allowed some relaxation for a few days before resuming normal activity.
There is nothing that we have mentioned here which should not heal after twenty days or so, then indicate the patient to raise their arm and keep it straight while avoiding sudden movements and ensuring restful sleep on an incline.
Note that this fracture in the arm will stabilize within thirty days or two to thirty-five days, and potentially forty-twenty days based on cases of swelling and strength conditions.
Chapter Thirteen.
In cases of hand and finger fractures.
The skin of the hand and fingernail protections rarely expose the fracture or even show much sign, so whenever a finger presents with either a fracture or healing, it is evident.
The patient should be seated upright with a chair in front of them.
Then, he places his hand flat and the bone setter stretches the broken bones until they form a good union; if so, it is recommended that the cast and splint be applied unless swelling occurs or redness appears, then a sling should be carried for as long as needed.
It was noted in a thin crack, where the fracture towards the palm side forms a partial ball-like shape from the split and the patient is instructed to grip it with their broken hand then pull on a long sling.
For the cast to be made of skin that is thin and not dry, with all fingers bent towards it and pulling on as needed; if the fracture extends outward then another cast should be placed above this one while still below the hand so the arm can remain extended.
Then he takes the grip as if turning his hand and connects it between the fingers with a knot, so that the edge of the cut is on one side safe, then he tightens with the other hand and makes Jibreka to have a small stool for resting the cut.
The cut does not move like the middle, index or little finger so that it remains in its place and is connected to the correct finger or connects them all on one side with Jibreka, which is better or places a small stool underne cuff.
As we said about the thumb and checked with Jibreka, before and after removing the boil as necessary, if something occurs like that which is repeated in its description.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In Jibreka for the cut of the calf.
The shin bone is often cracked and evident to the touch because it oscillates back and forth; when Jibreca is tightened, there will be a knot above the cut and another below it with sutures on its face.
Then each knot is stretched to its face in balance if the cut is at the middle of the shin bone, and otherwise (if it's near the origin of the calf) it should be a flexible knot with either wool or silk thread.
At the root of the gash towards the ankle, the ligature is applied above and the other below the cut; if the fracture is near the knee, then the ligature should be placed near the knee so that it falls downward. Then the physician removes the bone with both hands until it returns to its original shape.
If the bone is fractured cleanly, then it should be bandaged and splinted if no bleeding or inflammation has occurred; if an abscess does occur, let it drain for several days until the hot boil settles in, then return to treating it.
The splint should be wrapped around the fracture, a sturdy bandage applied twice or three times and left as much as possible; then wrap the leg until the knee reaches the origin of the thigh and insert a long string between the calf and shin near the ankle from below, with ends of the string coming up on either side.
Then manage the leg and calf as much as needed with additional bandaging; then on the site of the fracture, create a single incision in the shin bone and make it into one incision; then remove any deformities between the calf and sheriff by gently pulling them to level.
Then start with a strong grip in the middle of the incision for three turns or four, and after tightening the ligature at the location of the incision, your grip should be weaker and smoother.
Then insert the suture needle into the ligature you placed between the thigh and calf, then pass the tip of the thread through the stitches above it, continuing to pull down on one end of the thread until reaching the man's heels, also tying off both ends of the stitches from the other side.
Not letting the ligature slip from its place, then leaving the grip on it as long as possible without talking to the part or scratching and inflating so that something like that occurs, promptly resolves it and corrects everything related to it as we have mentioned repeatedly.
There was a crack in the bone, it is recommended to smooth that out if possible or else remove and extract it from there and treat the wound as you suggest until recovery, this incision on the thigh may not become infected by preventing contact with the leg through sutures.
As we have mentioned in the arm and elbow, such treatment should not expose it to illness or if treated alone without preventing its contact with the leg so that the owner does not become lame at all times.
Know that the swelling of the pharynx worsens in fifty days or increases slightly, decreases slightly; it depends on various conditions and other factors.
Chapter Fifteen.
In the knee fracture.
In a knee fracture, less exposure of the break and frequent presenting with pain indeed means that it is exposed as a crack either in the form of separation or spalling in its parts, with an injury but not necessarily bleeding.
It stands on this entirely by itself; persuade it to align what is separated in its parts with the fingers until they unite and heal according to how well joining, reconciliamo nt, and obedience are achieved, then apply a bandage and wear a roundly wrapped sleeve if required.
It becomes severe and agrees as such, then all the conditions we described in the previous break act like a hot abscess with its approach to associate each appearance so that it heals properly.
Chapter Sixteen.
In the fracture of the leg.
It has two bones; one is thick and called the tibia or shin, while the other is thin and called fibula, with them presenting various types of fractures. < |end| > Therefore, his work with the fracture was like that of the arm, both in treatment and execution: when all bones were broken, the leg turned towards every direction; and if the thinner bone broke, the leg bent backward; and if the thickest bcu occurred from below, nothing remained concealed.
Therefore, he worked with bandaging and splinting according to that, unless if the leg fracture was a serious one with many fragments in which case the binding should be less tight and gentle, while your effort must match his treatment.
And in the leg, if it was an excess of arm work, then when you splint and relieve all your efforts, take two boughs from a willow tree that are used for flattening rooms, placed between the frames or resembling palm leaves.
Choose one that is slightly thicker and not curved, with a length equal to the leg from knee to foot, then wrap each one around twice along its length; place one end on the calf and the other at the opposite side.
And to secure the leg from thigh to foot, then tie the two straps in three positions on either side and in the middle so that this strap prevents the leg from leaning left or right and stabilizes it well; a stick may also be used along the length of the leg.
And he places it to save from movement and more as needed in the section if there is a specific wound, then examines the leg daily with thorough care for swelling or inflammamoorting that. Whenever something like that occurs, it should be addressed as appropriate to heal and the leg bone is set in about thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
In the section on bones of the leg and fingers.
As for the ankle, it does not present a section break, but as for the leg bones they do present one; and also less so for the finger bones which show a section break only in some cases, but most often just normal healing.
Showing the leg bones with a fracture, I saw that some of these bones were set up on top of each other like cattle and then you put your foot upon those elevated bones and move them asunder.
Until they return to their places, then carry the pad and forceps from above placing underneamoos of the foot on a small table with two flat heads, then grip it with the foot firmly after loosening its stitches and sews what is needed below.
If it has been three days or four, then release the ligature and you will find the bone at the level was broken or dislocated as you see, and if some of the fingers are fractured you must set them accordingly as I described to you in finger joints of the hand.
Then make the broken finger straight and let a little of it protrude, then make underfoot this table I described to you and grip firmly, if two or three or more bones are fractured.
Make each bent finger to the extent of a loose tear and grip the table at foot lowering and be firmly anchored so that each head is outside of the foot's belly to adjust well.
And you must commit to all that we have mentioned to you in this fracture case and its symptoms, along with each appearance as it should be done.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the section: Vagina, Ovary, and Penis of a Man.
When the vagina breaks, it retreats backwards and pulls towards her back slightly until she clutches with a cotton string that leads to his penis, which is filled in the same manner as a ball. Then it returns into her vagina.
Then the woman sways and lifts slightly until that cotton string comes out at her vaginal opening as a ball, then it returns causing rupture of the ovary, after which she positions herself on all fours when she wishes to urinate, gently expelling the cotton.
She pushes it out as she did when entering, then returns to the first position, and does this for seven days or so until conception occurs; if desired, one can take a sheep's bladder, tie it tightly around her mouth, insert a tube, and fill completely into her vagina.
She then blows forcefully into the tube until it inflates inside her vagina, causing rupture and repair; afterward, she secures with cotton as previously described for a number of days until healed—whenever the ovary ruptures in either man or woman, one can use this method.
He arranged what we have described in the thigh bone, and you cannot miss being right with these strange fragments that I said fall into place, especially if one has some anatomical knowledge as this piece guides quite well.
If you are correct about the condition and toughen it, as mentioned by the man if a thigh femoral fracture enters him then he puts it in an unsewn dressing and becomes excited and leaves for three days or so until recovery.
The Ninth Chapter Eleven.
In bone fracture cases, if there is a wound.
It is advised that if one has a fracture with an open wound, especially if the bone is large like the thigh or hip bones, to promptly seek treatment and follow our guidelines for healing.
If the wound is bleeding, one should immediately attend to it with a powdered agent if nothing else is available and apply treatment for the fracture in that same day without delay.
If no abscess occurs, an abscess forming delays the fracture treatment until on the ninth day when it is occupied by a hot abscess and should not be approached within three or four days as this may lead to unfavorable symptoms.
It has been determined that a broken bone is visible on the skin, it should be set and bandaged by your hand gently, then allowed to heal; if you do not get the fracture to heal and bandage with this instrument, which is an iron device approximately seven fingers long. It should be presented on a suitable dressing for the wound.
Therefore, the physician should take three or four on each dressing as required by the type of fracture and ensure that it is sufficiently padded so that it does not bulge when pressed during work.
The edge is folded at its end and the top part is raised with padding, while from halfway down it becomes thinner as follows: [visual description or image of Albucasis' illustration would be here].
Called "piram" in Greek, a small tripod should be formed at the sharp edge of the bone protruding from the skin and pushed into it once to ensure that the bone is repositioned for correct alignment of fracture edges with each other. [This description refers to Albucasis' method for setting a protruding fragment.]
Indeed, the broken edge was delicate and the instrument did not grip it well; thus, it was necessary to cut a part of that bone so that the instrument could handle it. If one cannot break the baturong as we described in the example, then use any type of chisel mentioned previously.
Or use one of the chisels as best you can, then remove what remains in the bone from fragility and thin layers, if the bone is rebroken and find the condition after it has healed to be acutely painful, know that the bone did not return to its natural position.
If it has returned to its natural position, then you have greatly benefited the patient; if your treatment for the bone is successful, immerse a black leather pouch in hot water and apply it exclusebly if it is summer and do not place anything oily or greasy on the wound.
So that infection and decay do not occur, then use the bandages while resting from bone treatment and leave the wound open to scrape with a razor at intervals as long as necessary for healing.
Be cautious, as every caution requires that the wound be cut carefully; often what results is incompetent doctors causing death or consumption and diarrheabut hold your incision gently to heal easily, unlike those who are careless with their lacerations.
The wound was poor or a large one, and I feared some bad symptoms that we described and he found pain at the site distressing; it is not advisable to apply bandages there so he made for him strong tight strips near the flaps.
If a day or two later, I saw the wound starting to form pus and removed the sutures that were placed with alcohol; then used ligatures and tourniquets as we usually dress surgical wounds like the quaternary bandage and similar methods, and you should remove the stitches.
The wound checks every evening and morning until it heals and recovers, and you should apply a sitz bath to let the pus drain easily; it will take many days for the wound to heal without eating or stopping the discharge of pus, as I know there are small bone fragments.
It was necessary to examine the wound with a probe, removing those fragments that were detached and extracting them, as well as any non-detached pieces causing tissue swelling or pain at their site of origin.
Exhibiting a fistula, an abscess or another type of decay and infection, it was necessary to match each presentation with the treatment that its description provides at its beginning.
And it was necessary for one to stand by, cleansing your mind if a large bone breaks and bleeds onto the tissue like thigh or arm bones and similar body parts in large limbs not to be attracted to or expelled from them. Often, death is shown to result from such situations but left to decay after twenty days or even thirty.
Therefore, treat the wound if you see a place for treatment and do not leave it otherwise.
Chapter Twenty.
Treatment of the complex condition presented on a fracture.
This complexity is often presented on a fracture, especially near the joints where it affects tissue and may prevent the limb from performing its natural action.
It appears that the complex mixture was used in which medicines such as pearl, kohl, myrrh, aloeswood, and frankincense were to be taken individually or all together, ground with a solidified syrup, egg white, or vinegar.
She bore it on the complex mixture in a contraption and tightened it well, leaving the strain unreleased for many days before releasing it again until the complex dissolved by God's will or she pressed hard with a metal plate.
The property of lead is to permeate everything within the body, so the complex has hardened and intensified, causing urgency to remove it from above and pull out what emerged or cut off any threads with some absorbent material until healed and cured the wound completely.
The Twelfth Chapter.
In treating a fracture, if the bone remained fragile after that:... (This is the beginning of a section on fractures where Albucasis might have provided instructions for treatment in case the healing process resulted in weakened or delicate bones).
If a bone fracture has healed but the bone remains fragile, then this could be due to many reasons... (Albucasis would likely continue with an explanation of possible causes for weakened bone after fracture healing and potential treatments or considerations). One of them is either due to too many ligatures and tying them where they should not be, or perhaps over-tightening the ligatures so that food cannot reach the limb, or perhaps excessive bandaging at an inappropriate time, or perhaps too much movement for its time, or perhaps a low blood count within the body of the patient.
Treatment of that involves nourishing the patient and exercising their body until the blood increases in it, using baths, introducing joy and laughter towards them, then wearing a compress on the limb to attract food or soak the bandage with water generously. Until the nourishment returns to its natural form within it,
Chapter Two and Twenty.
In the treatment of fractured bones if the reduction and its effects were imposed against what is right.
Whenever a limb has been reduced after healing or shown through the fractured bone or complicated and scarred because of that, showing the image of the limn. But the limb does not cease from its natural actions, it should not be said that the limb is broken from above and there have been many false doctors and coercive ones who claim to do so in our land.
This deed is greatly condemnablen, leading to a great deception on the left hand injury; however, if the twisting and knotting are loose, one should soak in water that has boiled henna-like leaves such as those of the touchwood plant, Henbane, and Henbit.
It is bandaged with soft gauze like Dachylon or Henbane seeds are used, rubbed with chicken fat and cod liver oil and applied, or soaked almonds are crushed with hen dung and methods of using the medicines called Nāqidah are similar.
When the knotting gradually dissolves with continuous delicate surgery on both hands, if swelling has occurred and worsened or calcified and necessitated treatment with iron, it is treated accordingly.
It is advisancible to scrape it off and release the bone's connection, cut any excess knotting or bone with thin strips, use skillfully in that area with effort, then treat the wound as suggested until healed.
The Third and Twentieth Section.
The joint is a dislocation of the joint from its place in motion and distorts the shape of the bone, occurranguing on disease or severe pain, when a case of dislocation occurred, one should act promptly to correct it.
It does not delay him if the dislocation is delayed or inflamed with it, making correction difficult; therefore, one should not delay and move it at all when swelling occurs because severe diseases and pains often occur on them.
However, if that occurs, it should act to alleviate the disease and leave until the swelling settles slightly, then relocate the bone with hot water and oil gently, and manage each part as mentioned in its place.
The sections of dislocation have also been arranged according to what is presented from the upper body downward.
Chapter Four and Twenty. (This appears to be a chapter title or section header)
In the treatment of lower jaw dislocation. (Similarly, this seems to indicate an image caption or a subtitle for a section about treating lower jaw dislocation.)
The dislocation is nothing except for the absence and removing them, either one of the two being that they are not moving out from their positions in a gradual decline or completely removed until rested. (This appears to describe specific instructions or steps involved in treating an osteoarthritic dislocation.) To the chest until it overflows and cannot be held back, nor can one press down or unlock it; its tongue is paralyzed with speech. If they were to pull it out, in most cases it returns more severely on the left side.
If the removal is complete, it should be rushed for suturing without delay and he must grasp the root of the abscess and enter with one thumb into its origin at the opening in the mouth inside the cheek.
Or he enters with both thumbs if the fistula is from two sides and wraps them outside, commanding the abscess to burst its opening and release in all directions; the surgeon guides it out and pushes the fistula back to its place.
The difficulty of healing them is great, especially if the fistulas are all; use hot water and fat until they ease their scabbing over and do not delay their scab formation as we have said; if they return to normal and apply with lips of the abscess without relaxation then place a bandage from a cloth made of beeswax and fat.
Then gently tie the bandages of muslin, and let the patient rest on their back with their head elevated between two pillows so that they can be moved to the right but not to the left or forward, without having anything put in their mouth but making their food soft enough to swallow easily.
Until the pain subsides and the joint is movable, let them eat what they desire without discomfort while eating or drinking until the joint moves freely and heals completely.
Joint effusion occurs if the joints come apart and do not frequently return to their normal position, causing persistent inflammation and headache, possibly protruding of the abdomen in the patient's illness, and possibly pus drainage from a perforated ulcer. If you see this, understand that it is injured.
And often he dies from the symptoms of this within a week,
The Fifth and Twentieth Chapter.
In the prolapse of joints and the medial aspect.
Regarding luxation, it does not dislocate from the inner side of its attachment to the chest and may dislocate externally. This is evident by touch and forces the patient to lie on their back with their arms outstretched.
Then press the spot with your hand firmly, as it will recede; then place the suture and ointment on it, and tighten it. As for the edge that extends to the corner and is connected to it, it should not be removed except in exceptional cases when it needs to be readjusted or replaced according to what we have mentioned earlier and as long as you are willing.
Then place the suture, ointment, and tighten it, and bandage the wound with a dressing and rest until healed; through this treatment, the corner of the wound may recede if it also moves from its position,.
Chapter Six and Twenty.
In response to the removal of the corner wound.
Be aware that the corner wound only detaches in three ways: one is towards the side to below, another is towards the chest, and sometimes it may detach upwards from the corner; this occurs during a recession.
It does not detach to the back of where the shoulder is or to the left of where the nerve is, and it most often separates towards below near the side and especially in those with little fat as it exits quickly from them and enters quickly.
As for those whose meat is abundant, he becomes so weak that it is as if he were to leave with difficulty and enter with difficulty; perhaps he will show signs of a fall or hit from the frenzy and hot chili, which makes him seem as if his intestines have burst. It should be examined until full recovery.
At this point, progress is made in his treatment, and if the incision goes down towards the anus so that you find a connection between the dislocated mesentery and the correct one, it will appear on the outside as though there is a difference, but when you feel underneath the perineum, the head of the mesentery has crushed while touching its top.
The patient does not consider himself able to raise his hand to his ear or move it in all movements, and if he bursts towards the chest or above, you will find this apparent upon touching.
This dislocation may facilitate recovery. If it was smooth or the patient was a boy, you will find him raising his arm above and then making your thumbs below his perineum and lifting the joint forcefully to its original position while he raises his arm upwards and extends his hand.
Then he places it at the bottom, and when removed quickly, it did not come off as we mentioned earlier; after a period of many days, the patient should bathe in hot water, using the tub that is rolled out and made to simmer like cooking the roots of onions, bulrushes, and eggplant in water.
Then the patient is draped over their back with a ball of cotton that is moderately soft, and the physician stands behind it, holding the patient's hand and stretching them downward.
Then he pushes the ball forward with his foot, and if you choose to repeat this on this side, it should extend the patient's leg further than their body, stopping them from one side and inserting a hook underneath their groin, lifting up until the patient is suspended in air. Then another support draws the patient's hand downward to their lower abdomen, making them lighter in weight; it is advisable for them to be suspended by something else that would ease them off, and the dislocation comes back within an hour, or may also occur on another side.
He is to focus on a long piece of wood with a rounded head resembling a buffalo's horn, not thick and not thin, then place it under the suture after placing a flexible incision on its top.
Then extend his hand downward from the other side and stretch the body as well with force, so that the joint returns to its position quickly; if he has difficulty recovering what we mentioned, use this treatment by taking a long piece of wood near your hands. And show them up to four fingers and thicken it by two fingers, so that the head is rounded for easy insertion into the suture on this image:.
Then tie a flexible incision on the rounded head so that it does not harm the wooden piece, then position under the suture and extend all fingers and hands towards the wood downwards and attach the wood to the armrest and seat and side of hand.
Then place the arm on a plane surface, extend and lower the hand while leaving the body suspended from the other side so that the joint enters its socket; if it has entered any face, it should be placed underne. The suture should have a cylindrical pad of suitable length made of woolen material.
Then he takes the ready plaster mixed with manure of fly dung and egg white, covering the entire wound as it rotates above, then tightening the ball from under the bandage firmly and spinning with a loop on the dressing from top to bottom, hanging by its hand at the neck.
He leaves it without moving his hand for seven days, should make the patient's food a little until the tissue is faster to cover him; then after seven or five days, he exercises in movement if it has stabilized and does not relapse openly.
The joint was loosened a lot by the moisture exposed to it or another leak; it should be operated in it with three spatulas at what is provided on its opening, and this has been made and examined with the loop after seven days but did not stabilize the joint.
He repeated the bandaging and pressure on it several times, but did not stabilize and fell back, rested and could not be lifted again; knowing that the nerve in the head of the joint may have cut off or extended or relaxed, then since the joint does not stabilize at its place.
Concerning the fracture that is towards the chest and the limb, with pushing and stretching by hand until it returns, which is used in pulling and treating until recovery; after setting of the bone casts appear in the tissue and slow down movement.
The humoral disease does not work excessively until the bone cast is softened and returns to its original state.
Section 720.
Regarding the treatment of a dislocated fracture.
The elbow dislocation occurs with difficulty and also returns with difficulty, affecting all the parts including towards the back or front; it is not hidden from you as it is under visual observation and by touch without any form of dislocation.
If the dislocated elbow is reduced correctly, this will be evident to you by a visible deformity of the joint and it cannot bend or touch its tip; immediate reduction should occur before presenting with an inflammatory reaction.
It presents with a difficult inflammatory reaction as its rejection and perhaps the bone point has not yet healed, especially if the dislocation is towards the back; it becomes severe in all types of fractures along with pain and often accompanied by death.
He must be able to reach the patient'amoebius with both hands fully extended and his doctor's hand from above and below, pushing the joint with all fingers or by the palm until it returns to its place.
If the joint recedes too far to bend, he must continue until the palm's lower part with which it is clasped strikes it; do not unlock but use a strong pull and lengthen both arms.
The patient also grasps both hands so as not to fall when pulled and turns the arm towards each side after wrapping a rolled or wide cloth on his hand, and if he attaches the doctor's hand to the joint, it should be anointed with oil for easier dislocation of the joint.
Then the joint is pushed back strongly until it returns, and after its return a band to hold with linen impregnated in egg white should be applied tightly and the arm from the neck of the patient hung for some days.
Then if the joint is stable in its place, disengage the band and leave it; but if the joint has not stiffened then reapply the dressing and the tape for some more days until it does, after which a lymph occurs following the return of the joint and its reduction.
When hindered in movement, immerse in a bath and perform gentle manipulation or massage until the joint becomes flexible; then secure it with a sturdy bandage, leaving it for a day and night; afterwards, remove it and reintroduce into the bath; if effusion is severe from the affected joint, there will be moderate improvement.
Then, reapply the bandage three more times with a bath until it becomes flexible; if desired, create a damp buffalo skin poultice with butter and wrap around it to do so repeatedly, as this will make it increasingly flexible, returning it to its original state.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
In the treatment of dislocations.
The thumb joint dislocates frequently, and repositioning is facilitated by the surrounding joints except to hasten its healing within the hour before it may injure or become inflamed due to heat.
The repositioning should place the affected thumb on a tray, extend the hand, and the surgeon places his palm over the joint to press it back until the dislocation no longer seems visible in the finger's interior.
Lay the patient'n upright and place their hand on a table, so that the joint is at an equal level to the physician's hand; then have them rest their inner hand on the table while the doctor places their hand directly above the same joint. If resistance is met, either release or secure with a compressant bandage for swelling.
Leave it to rest, and if not healed, then only after some days may the joint remain bent without causing further harm to the injury unless the hand has relaxed and is able to grasp something.
Then you know the nerve is cut or torn, and there's no help but to bind it tightly; sometimes this works well, while at other times it does not; if the bone fracture has healed, then remove the compressant bandage we described and leave it bound for five days.
Then the hand will heal and regain its use, but if there is a stiffness or limpness in motion, anoint it with warm oil repeatedly until it's supple again.
Chapter Nine and Twenty.
In the Treatment of Finger Joints.
The fingers may be broken to each side when one breaks from them, and when the finger is broken towards the surface or interior of the palm, lengthen the finger and push the joint back with your thumb until it returns, then connect the top of the finger and hang it toward the side that broke.
Leave it for two days, then release and extend until its balance day is restored; if at night, tie as instructed but continue to move it during the day and exercise it at night, do so for several days until strengthened.
Likewise, do with it if broken to the palm side by tying towards itself and doing as you first did until recovered, and similarly when broke into the surface of joints, etc.
Chapter Thirty.
Treatment for shoulder dislocation.
Shoulder dislocation occurs when the shoulder joints, complete separation of neck joints or many bursae are absent from their positions; thus it cannot be treated because death hastens to the illness.
Such a sign indicates that the illness exits unintentionamocially and cannot be contained, often one of its limbs relaxes away whether it is his leg or arm or one of them; moreover, if one bursa has disappeared from its position, it frequently disappears.
It will disappear in four directions, and as for treating it, if the swelling occurred due to a fall or blow of some kind, there is no treatment or cure available.
The early references to her cure involved lengthy explanations, which have now been summarized with a few words more than what has been provided by those close to the meaning and explanation of it, presenting the instrument contrary to how they described and explained it.
I say that the swelling on the chest has no remedy or relief, and similarly those on the sides are also incurable; only those occurring on the back can be treated as described by me, which involves extending it to its surface.
On a low stall near the wall, with something below it made wet to avoid injuring his chest, he places a vertical stick inserted into a hole in the ground on one side of the stall towards its head and another piece of wood towards his legs on the other side.
The attendant grasps the stick, which is not anchored in the hole, and another servant holds the other end of that structure; then it tears on the chest of the patient undernepressure with flexible and strong cords extended to the wood at its head, securing it there.
Then it is gripped by another cord on the elbow and above the knee, then all the cords are gathered together and attached to the other piece of wood next to the patient's legs; each servant extends their end to the wood with a ribbon without leaving from its central position.
However, they are not secured as we stated; the surgeon places his hand forcefully into the hole until it is withdrawn or he lays a board over it then sits on the board with his legs until it returns; if this treatment fails to make it return, a board of length approaching three lengths would be taken.
And she digs in the wall we mentioned near where the patient will be inserted from one side of the board, then places the board on the edge and the surgeon puts his legs on the other side and pulls firmly until he grunts with strain.
The passage returns to its place, and if you wish it shall be made using a wooden model that is carried by hand and shall fall onto the ground at the head of the afflicted in another doorway; two pieces of wood each measuring one cubit long, placed on their feet also by another doorway.
After, there should be a space of an arm's length between each piece of wood; and in each piece of wood a hole is made where the wooden model runs through, securing both pieces to the ground so that the table does not move and a round rod enters the holes in both pieces of wood.
On its side, a hole is made and secured with a rod of arm's length so that it wraps around both other pieces of wood similarly; then the rope which was tied to the patient in the wooden model at the head and the ropes tied at the legs are pulled by the wooden model.
Then at each wooden model stands a servant carrying the rope which is pulled by the wooden grotesque, and the doctor raises his hand on what has been presented to him; this is an image of the wooden model, doorway, and patient.
Then after the limb returns and is in its proper position, it should carry a gauze pad soaked with white egg; then tie the gauze and place on top of the padding an ant from a board to be the size of three fingers or so and length as much as the location of the joint.
On the correct suture and then use the thread that is appropriate for the condition until healed; if there remains a scar, it should be treated with medication that soothes and numbs along with using the tablet we described over a long period of time.
In that case, a lead paste may be used, and the scar should reappear on other incisions which can cause an extra bone to form; with this treatment it will not become exposed unless death occurs at some point during the healing process.
Surgical and theraader (chapter).
Regarding treatment of slipped discs.
Note that the hip and knee joints only show dislocation, not what others experience with gradual wear and tear, and a knee dislocates on four sides.
This means it dislocates inward, outward, to the side and behind, more than just to the inside; outside or back. The sign of a hip dislocation is that if you measure the correct limb with the patient's intact one, it will be longer.
The leg is more accurate, and the patient cannot bend their foot when riding a horse; the position where the horse stands was clearly marked by having the tip of the calf there.
The marking that shows the joint to be pushed outward presents symptoms opposite to these symptebut it simplifies and straightens the leg without causing pain, except for a slight twinge in the limb which is not enough to prevent walking on it towards the side.
The patient's thigh and the horse he rides on prevent him from walking by leaning back when walking, but if the joint is pushed to the back it does not simplify or twinge in the leg before the horse can bend its knee; his legs are also shorter than the other.
The horse is relaxed and the position of the hock is clearly indicated at heel height, but in response to this type of fracture it seems that this joint was old and had been dislocated a long time ago with someone who did not attempt relocation and remained as such without any reduction therapy.
It is not fitting for him to expose it, and as for the one who loosened a joint of four types: he prompted the joint to swell, lengthening inwardly and outwardly, moving it rightwards and leftwards.
He did not seek any other treatment than this, and it was not fitting for him to be supported strongly extending his leg either by hand or by straps tied above the ankle of his foot with another support stretching it outward.
With his hands entering under the bandage, then he loosens a soft strip at the root of the calf and grabs one end of the tape while another support is used as thirdly to extend it either from knee sidewards towards sole or from behind towards frontside.
They are all extended once until the swelling of the injury rises with his body off the ground, remaining hanging, for this type of extension is common among the four types mentioned; otherwise there should not be any other treatment for each type that we have mentioned.
As for its specific expulsion, if the fracture is to be inside it should be lifted onto the correct side then bandages placed on the origin of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the location beneath the calf muscle.
Then the bandage is extended from beneath the calf to above the body towards the buttocks, then a second assistant uses their arms to support the affected thigh and hugs the weighty position of the afflicted thigh while stretching it outwards significantly before returning to its original place.
This type of treatment is easier than the previous types, so with this part healing you should not have to resort to this type of immediate surgery where both legs of the afflicted are tied together with elastic bands on both knees and ankles.
Each one of them will have four fingers holding, and the afflicted leg would be extended further than the other by two fingers, then it is hung from a piece of wood located in the house to the ground with arms' length distance away.
Then a strong boy is commanded to hug the head of the thigh and another boy hangs onto the afflicted leg while the first holds it, so that when the second pushes the first holding the thigh with force, the joint returns to its place quickly; as for this part's expulsion if it were an external fracture.
It was necessary to tie the patient on a table as we described in the book of the rib, tightening the rope around his affected leg and chest, then placing two sticks at his feet and one at his head, followed by placing an additional stick in the middle of the table firmly.
She wrapped a moist bandage around her, so that the stick between her thighs would pull down towards the ground at the joint and she spread both ends to form an angle, while the doctor held her wrist with his hands in response to her return.
He was placed on the board and pressed down as we mentioned in the book of ribs, whether correctly or not, it is necessary for the patient to be tied to one side, if sliding to the left then extend his leg once more according to this description with a look at him lying on the table.
The doctor places his right hand on the affected heel and presses it with his left hand, however, the pressure is directed downward to the side of the leg if sliding backwards then there should not be an extension to the foot.
He is elevated on the ground, but should be placed on a solid object as mentioned before being tied up and pushed out from undernenailing on the stretcher, with his face downward and straps tightened.
He also applies the lever with the board as previously mentioned where the joint exits, if needed to bring out knee joint; it should be done at its proper location and do not forget to extend the affected leg.
If you see them with two levels and the affected leg is grabbed and straightened without difficulty, then understand that it has returned to its proper place; therefore, bend both shins and apply a dressing tightly so the leg cannot be moved towards any direction.
The leg must rest. Three days or four then untie the bandages, remove the dressing and elevate the other foot; if you see them at ease in any amount, understand that the fracture has set allowing for walking, and even if you observe relaxation.
Return it to bandaging and tightening as per your first manner and also leave it for three more days then untie it and let him walk on them until healed, God willing, if He wills so.
Chapter Two and Three.
In the treatment of dislocating the joint.
The joint dislocates in three ways: inside out, outside in, and downwards towards the back of the thigh. And a sign that it is dislocated for the disease to involve joining the leg at the calf.
If it does not stick to the calf, then one can deduce that the joint is dislocated, and all sides of its dislocation must lie down flat on the ground with their legs extended outwards and grip behind them to grab the center while sitting slightly backwards and turning backward a little. Then you sit on his shin.
And your back touches his face, and you place your foot between his feet, then constrain his ankle with both hands, entangle them with your fingers on his anculet, and forcefully include one of its sides by the strength of another leg that stretches out until the joint returns to its position.
And a sign that it is returned to its place in an unmanipulated state, then they bind them and attach the leg to the calf, then tie all of them together with a rope for three or four days, and release them only after a short walk each day until they gain strength.
Indeed, it is impossible for you to follow as we described and otherwise use the traction forces with the bindings that are supplied for its treatment until it returns,.
Chapter Three and Thirty.
In Treating Ankle Fracture.
The ankle may experience a gradual loss and be completely fractured, causing it to either dislocate inward or outward; observe the fracture line being prominently bulging towards that direction.
For treating a dislocation that has completely fractured, it is easier to have the patient lie down and gently push until it returns. If it is fully fractured, it should be treated by having the patient sit upright with a force exerted by an assistant's hand from behind his back in the middle.
Then, hold his right foot's top with your right hand and the left foot's bottom from below in position of ligaments, then rotate it towards you using both hands twice; extend it further using your left hand and push his chest upwards with your right hand away from the thigh.
You do it twice as we described; on the third time, push his chest upwards to his thigh and rotate at the ligaments. It returns in one or two attempts like this; you see that foot is level, otherwise repeat the work until it returns.
In this condition, take it as we described and otherwise raise the ailment on its back on the ground, insert and fasten it firmly in place between its legs, then wrap a cut around it so that the illness does not harm it further, then adjust its leg brace.
Then the other leg is stretched either by hand or attached with a cord around the man's neck, then both supports are extended except for the first one and the rod stands between its legs holding it so that it does not pull the body down during extension, then the doctor straightens the arm fracture.
The other support is then held straight down so that the fracture heals quickly, if the fancier returns and shows you are healthy to resume bandages, compression, and fasten with strong straps, also bend your foot towards the strap at the bottom, and avoid putting weight on the top of the ankle.
So that the strap does not harm it, then leave for two or three days and rest while still fastened, then release on the third or fourth day, and let the patient avoid walking for forty days.
Indeed, before this period, the fracture did not heal properly and would rot, and no further treatment was successful; it is advisamo to use a hot poultice as we have described in another location for non-treatment and immobilization until recovery.
Chapter Four and Thirty.
In treating a finger fracture.
It should be smoothed out over a walk without force, not because it is difficult but rather easy; in some cases of foot fractures, the fracture was on top of the foot and one should make the lesion stand above ground level.
Or on a table and standing like a soldier, then put your foot on what remains of those joints and press them with your foot forcefully until they return to their position without showing in the original place.
Then make the sole of his foot flat like a board and press it with firm pressure for three days, then untie it and keep him from walking until he strengthens enough for its return if Allah wills.
Chapter Five and Thirty-Three.
In the types of dislocations, those that occur with a wound or a fracture or both simultaneously.
When such an event occurred, treatment and correction were often followed by death.
Therefore, such a case should only be entrusted to an expert in the field with extensive experience, who is meticulous and compassionate, patient and not hasty, and uses medicines initially that target heating tumors alone.
May God grant us safety from the ailment, with its mild appearance and some hope of recovery within your timeframe before the heating tumor arises.
The part to which you intended to apply a treatment that heats tumors, along with treating the wound using well-dried cups, led to dislocation in conjunction with a fracture of the bone, producing dry fragments. And followed, as we mentioned in simple diseases, what is appropriate for their positions.
May your efforts and journey be free from the path of error as I have advised you, so that you may remain safe in my care and present yourself according to God's will.
