 CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO.
On cauterization of scrofulous tumours.
 When the tumours arise from phlegm and cold humidities and are not to be dispersed with medicines and you wish for a rapid dispersal, then heat the hollow cautery of which this is the figure.
It is open at both ends to give exit for the fumes of burning from the other end.
Place it hot, right on the tumour, once, or twice if need be, till you reach the bottom of the tumour.
If the tumour be small, suit the cautery to the size of the tumour.
Then let be for three days and apply cotton wool soaked in butter until the eschar has disappeared.
Then treat with ointments and with plugs of lint till healed. [
Cauterize at whichever end you prefer according to circumstances.
This is the figure of the tube].
