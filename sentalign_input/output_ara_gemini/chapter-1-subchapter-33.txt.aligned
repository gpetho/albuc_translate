Chapter thirty-three on cauterizing diarrhea.	CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE. On cauterization for diarrhoea.	0.864262
If the diarrhea is from cold and humors, so that it weakens the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and it has been treated with various treatments, but has not healed, and you see the patient tolerating cautery and having sufficient strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, as mentioned previously in cauterizing the stomach with the circular cautery iron, and four gentle cauterizations around the navel with the gentle nail-shaped cautery iron, and a large cautery on the coccyx above the buttocks, or two cauteries.	When the diarrhoea is due to frigidity and humidities so that the capacity of the stomach and intestines to hold and to digest is impaired, and this has been treated by various methods and is not cured; if you see that the patient is able to endure the cautery and is of unimpaired strength, make a big cauterization on his stomach according to the preceding instructions for cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery; and four narrow cauterizations round his navel with the thin claviform cautery; and one or two big cauterizations in the lumbar region over the coccyx.	0.9097078
If you see that the humors are abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the pubis and a cautery on each flank, and perhaps you may add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment whose benefit will not fail, God willing.	And if you see that the humidities are superabundant, and the patient fit to tolerate it, then make one cauterization over the groin and one over the hypochondrium. You may also add two small ones over the stomach near the big one. This is an effective treatment that does not fail to help.	0.77935594
