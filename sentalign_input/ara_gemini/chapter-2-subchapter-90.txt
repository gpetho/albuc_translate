Chapter ninety on severing varicose veins.
Varicose veins are twisted, thick veins filled with black residues that occur in most parts of the body, and most commonly in the legs, especially in porters, donkey drivers, and laborers.
First, one should use strong shaking of the body from black bile several times, then bleed the basilic vein.
As for its treatment with iron, it is of two types: one is to incise and extract the black blood, and the other is to extract the vein entirely.
As for incising it, it is done in this way: first, the leg is bathed with very hot water until the thick, turbid blood dissolves, then the patient's leg is tied from above his thigh to below his knee with a turban, then the vein is incised in one, two, or three wide incisions, then the black blood is extracted by hand from the bottom of the leg upwards and from top to bottom until the amount of blood that you see sufficient or what the patient's strength can tolerate is extracted, then it is bandaged and the patient is instructed to avoid foods that produce black bile, and the purging and bleeding are repeated whenever the veins become full and that harms the patient.
As for extracting it, it is done in this way: the patient's leg is shaved if it has a lot of hair, then he enters the bath and his leg is bathed with hot water until it reddens and the vein swells, or he exercises vigorously if he does not have a bath until the limb warms up.
Then the skin opposite the vein is incised lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or below it near the heel, then the skin is opened with hooks and the vein is skinned from all sides until it is exposed to the touch, and when it appears, you see it bright red, and when it is free from the skin, you see it also like a tendon.
Then a probe is inserted under it until it rises and emerges from the skin, then it is hung with a smooth, blunt hook.
Then another incision is made near that incision about three fingers wide, then the skin is peeled off the vein until it appears.
Then lift it with the probe as you did and hang it with another hook as you did before.
Then make another incision or many incisions if you need to.
Then pull it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull it and extract it until it comes out of the second incision, then pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, until when all of it comes out, cut it.
If it does not respond to pulling and extraction, insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread and tie it and pull it, and insert the probe under it and twist it with your hand in every direction until it comes out, and be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to extract it and it will cause harm to the patient.
When you have extracted all of it, put wool dipped in wine and rose oil or oil on the wounds and treat it until it heals.
If the varicose vein is convulsive, with curves and twists in different directions, and not straight as we have said, then it is necessary to incise it at each of its curves and twists, then hang it with hooks until you extract it entirely.
Be careful when incising it not to cut or injure the vein, for it will make it difficult for you to extract it, so be very careful.

Image of the blind fishhook:
It should not have a curvature like other hooks.
And it should not be sharp at the tip so that it does not injure the vein/vessel.
And it should be thick at the bend, smooth, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein/vessel with its thinness.
Rather, it should have extra thickness, as we have said.
