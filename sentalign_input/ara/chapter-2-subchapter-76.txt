Chapter Seventy-Six.
On extracting the dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the section on treatment and it does not come out, and the matter compels you to work with the hand, then you should observe. If the woman is of sound strength and there are no symptoms that you fear will cause her harm, then the woman should lie down on a bed on her back.
And her head should be inclined downward and her legs elevated, and an assistant should hold her on both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body is not pulled when the fetus is extended.
Then the mouth of her womb is moistened with moist oils along with marshmallow mucilage, fenugreek, and flax seeds.  Then the midwife anoints her hand with these oils and mucilages, then inserts it gently into the womb. Then she searches for a place to insert the hooks into the fetus, and suitable places for that.
Observe, if the fetus is coming headfirst, then insert the hooks into its eyes, or into the nape of its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin or its collarbone, or in the places near the ribs, or under the shoulder blades.
And if it is coming feet first, then in the pubic bone and the middle ribs. And the hook should be held in the right hand and its curve placed between the fingers of the left hand, and the hand inserted gently, and the hook inserted into one of those places that we mentioned.
Until you reach an empty space, then insert opposite it another hook, or a third if needed, so that the pulling is even and does not tilt to one side.  Then pull evenly, and the pulling should not be straight only, but move it in every direction.
So that its exit is easy, as is done with a tooth when extracting it. And in between, the pulling should be relaxed. If one side of it is stuck, the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from the side to turn what is stuck. If part of the fetus comes out, move the hooks to other places.
They are a little higher up. Do this until the entire fetus comes out. If a hand comes out before anything else and it cannot be put back due to its compression, then it should be wrapped with a cloth, then pull it until, when it has come out completely, you cut it off.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow, and thus should be done with the other hand and with the feet. If the head of the fetus is large and experiences compression during birth, or if there is fluid accumulated in its head, then a sharp scalpel should be inserted between the fingers.
And with it the head is incised so the fluid comes out, or extract it with the instrument that is called the extractor, whose image appears with the images of all the other instruments in the chapter after this one.
Likewise, do this if the fetus is naturally large-headed: the skull should be incised or crushed with the extractor, as we said, then extract the bones with the forceps. If the head emerges and gets compressed at the clavicle, make an incision so that the moisture in the chest pours out.
For the chest then contracts. If the chest does not contract and birth is not possible, then cut piece by piece as best you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or there is a hernia, it should be lanced so that the moisture drains from it.
If the fetus is by its feet, then pulling it is easy and its alignment at the mouth of the womb is simple. If it gets compressed at the abdomen or chest, then you should pull it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand and cut the abdomen or chest so that what is in them drains out.
If you have extracted all the limbs and the head retracts and gets stuck, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, she should insert the hand into the cervix and search for the head and pull it with the fingers to the mouth of the womb, then insert a hook or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has closed due to a hot swelling that has affected it, you should not be rough with it, but rather use moist, fatty pours and apply compresses, and sit in baths that relax and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, if it can be adjusted, use what we mentioned for the live fetus. If that is not possible, then cut it piece by piece and extract it. It is important not to leave any part of the placenta inside at all. When you are finished with your treatment, use what we have mentioned regarding the treatment of hot swellings that occur in the womb.
If bleeding occurs, she should descend into astringent baths and use all other treatments. I have seen a woman who was pregnant and the fetus died in her womb, then she became pregnant again on top of it.
Then the other fetus also died, and after a long time a swelling appeared in her hypogastrium and swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, so I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal, so I placed on it some of the ointments with strong drawing power.
A bone came out of the area, then after a few days, another bone came out. I was surprised by this, as the abdomen is a place without bones.  I estimated that they were from the bones of the dead fetus. I explored the wound and extracted many bones from the skull of the fetus.
I continued to follow this until I extracted many bones from her, and the woman was in the best of health. She lived in that state for a while, discharging a little pus from the area. I have only mentioned this unusual case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
