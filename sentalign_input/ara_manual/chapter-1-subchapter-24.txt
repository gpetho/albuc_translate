Chapter Twenty-Four.
On Cauterization for Diseases of the Lung and Cough.
If the cough and disease of the lung are due to cold humors, and the patient does not have fever or phthisis, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the clavicles in the soft, empty, depressed areas, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And the cautery should be nail-shaped in the form that was described previously. And if you wish, let your cauterization be by puncture with the cautery that is called the "puncturing cautery," whose form was previously presented in the puncturing for earache. And the punctures should be from thirty punctures to about that number.
Then treat him with what was mentioned previously until he recovers.  A cautery with three prongs can be made in this form, and cauterization with it is faster because you cauterize three cauteries at once with it.  And this is the form of the cautery.
