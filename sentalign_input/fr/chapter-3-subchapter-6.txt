Of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks either broadly or in the middle, and it can only be known by touch; so align it according to the shape of the fracture, and return it to its natural form in every way you can; then put mill dust with plenty of eggs on the spot, and light tow, and place a double cloth on it; then place a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if there is a depression under the splint in any part of the shoulder, fill that depression with linen tow, so that the splint sits evenly; then firmly bind it all with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day; and every time it loosens, tighten it, and set the splint correctly if it is out of place, and have the patient lie on their side; and the shoulder is restored in 20 or 25 days. And when this number is completed, untie it, and be sure, because it is not a bone that dislocates easily.
And if a piece of bone protrudes and points under the skin, cut above it, and remove it, and do what we have said for the fracture of the collarbone to soothe a hot abscess.
