The author of this book, having completed for you, O sons, this book which is a complete part of the science of medicine in its entirety and having attained its peak in terms of clarity and explanation, has deemed it necessary to complete it for you with this article, which is a part of the practical application.
Because manual practice is improved in our country and at our time, it is completely absent, to such an extent that the study of its science has become forgotten and its traces have disappeared. Only a few vestiges of it remain in the works of the ancients, which have been altered by hands and distorted by errors and confusion, making their meanings obscure and their benefits distant.
I have therefore decided to revive it and compose this article, explaining, elucidating, and condensing, and including illustrations of surgical instruments and other tools used in practice, as these are essential for a comprehensive understanding.
The reason there are no skilled manual practitioners in our time is that the practice of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first familiarize themselves with the science of anatomy, as described by Galen. So that they can understand the benefits of the organs, their structures, temperaments, connections and disconnections, and know the bones, nerves, muscles, their quantities, origins, arteries, and veins, both moving and stationary, and the locations of their openings.
Therefore, Albucasis said: "There are many physicians in name only, and few in actual practice, especially in the art of surgery. We have touched on this in the introduction to this book.
For he who is not knowledgeable about the anatomy that we have mentioned is liable to make errors that can kill people, as I have often seen many who imagined themselves experts in this science but claimed it without knowledge or understanding.
I have seen a physician, ignorant of anatomy, attempt to remove a tumor from a woman's neck, accidentally damaging some of the neck's arteries, causing the woman to bleed to death in his hands.
I have also seen another physician, skilled in removing stones, attempt to extract a large stone from a man who had been stabbed in the kidney. Due to its size, he used part of the urinary bladder to remove it. The man died approximately three days later, and I had been called to remove the stone. Upon examining it, I estimated its size and the patient's condition.
I have also seen another physician, practicing medicine for a living, serving some of our country's leaders.
I witnessed a doctor, in his ignorance, rushing to treat a young Black man with a broken leg near the ankle, who also had a wound. The physician, without understanding, quickly immobilized the fracture using ropes and casts, tightly binding them, and did not leave any space for the wound to breathe.
Then he released himself to his desires, and left him for several days, ordering him not to untie the bandage until his leg and foot had swelled and were on the verge of death.
Then I was called to him, and I quickly untied the bandage, so he found relief from his pains, but the damage had already taken hold in the member, and I could not stop its progress.
The corruption continued to spread throughout the member until he died.
I saw another physician, skilled and wise, treating a tumor that was cancerous. After several days, it became worse for the patient, as cancer, when it is pure blackness, should not be treated with iron under any circumstances.
Except when it is in a member where it can be completely removed.
For this, my son, you must know that manual work is divided into two parts: the work that brings safety, and the work that causes harm in most cases.
I have warned everywhere in this book about the work that contains danger and fear; you must be cautious and reject it.
In order that the ignorant do not find an opportunity to speak or dispute, take hold of yourself with resolve and caution, and for your patients, with kindness and careful consideration.
And employ the best path leading to safety and a favorable outcome, avoiding dangerous and difficult diseases.
Purify yourselves from what you fear may enter your thoughts and cause doubt in your faith and worldly affairs, for it is the endurance of your status and elevation in both this world and the hereafter.
As Galen said in one of his precepts: "Do not treat a bad disease, lest you become bad doctors.
This article is divided into three doors.
First Door.
In this door, we discuss the treatment of wounds with fire and sharp medicines, arranged in order from the most severe to the least, including illustrations of cauterization tools, instruments, and all other necessary items for manual surgery.
Second Door.
In the sections on incisions, punctures, phlebotomy, cupping, surgery, removal of arrows, and so forth, all are categorized and arranged with illustrations of instruments.
**Chapter Three**
In the sections on setting bones, dislocations, treatment of fractures, and similar topics, all are categorized and arranged from the newest to the oldest with illustrations of instruments.
**Chapter One**
**On Burns**
Before discussing the procedure, it is necessary to mention the benefits and drawbacks, and in what temperaments it is used.
I say that discussing the benefits and drawbacks of burn treatment is a lengthy matter, a precise science, and a hidden mystery. Many scholars have spoken on this subject.
They have differing opinions on this topic, and I have condensed their brief remarks to avoid excessive length.
I say that burn treatment is beneficial in general for various temperaments, whether with or without a material cause, except for two: the hot temperament without a material cause and the dry temperament without a material cause.
On the Dry Humours and Their Treatment: Some maintain that cauterization is beneficial in cases of dry humours, while others disagree, stating that cauterization is not indicated for conditions characterized by heat and dryness, as fire itself possesses these qualities.
It is impossible to treat a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry remedy; those who advocate the opposite state that fire cauterization may be beneficial for a hot and dry condition in the human body. Because when you add the human body and its moisture to the fire's temperament, it cools the human body.
And I adhere to his opinion, for experience has shown me this many times; however, one should not imagine this unless they have mastered and trained extensively in the art of cauterization. He observed the variation in human temperaments, the nature of diseases within individuals, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other humours, you have no cause for concern, especially regarding cold and wet conditions; all physicians agree on this, and there is no disagreement about the benefit of cauterization in such cases.
Know, O my children, that the secret of treating with fire (cauterization) and its superiority to other hot remedies lies in fire's singular nature; its effect is localized to the member it touches, causing minimal harm to nearby connected parts.
The use of cauterizing drugs may extend beyond the intended organ, potentially causing difficulty in treatment or even death. Fire, due to its noble and refined essence, does so only when misused.
This has been proven to us through experience, with lengthy service, meticulous care in practice, and understanding of the facts.
For this reason, I have omitted lengthy discourse; however, if it were not unbecoming of this book, I would share with you a mysterious secret about fire and its effect on the body, as well as its ability to dispel illness through philosophical and rational argument that would exceed your comprehension.
Know, my sons, that there is disagreement among them regarding the optimal time for cauterization, and they consider the best time to be in the spring.
I say that cauterization can be appropriate at any time, for the harm caused by time passes into the benefit gained through cauterization. Especially if cauterization is for essential, severe, and urgent pain that cannot be delayed due to the fear of further harm, which may be greater than the damage caused by time itself.
Do not think, my sons, as the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization, which heals a certain illness, will never return and is considered definitive; they make it a necessity.
And it is not as they thought, for cauterization is not like a remedy that alters the humor and dries up the moistures that cause pain.
Cauterization, however, is superior to medication in terms of the speed of its success, the strength of its effect, and the intensity of its power.
The illness may return at times due to the patient's humor, the persistence of their disease, the accumulation of humors in their body, and neglect of self-care through diet and other causes.
However, if the illness that requires cauterization is mild and in a body part with fewer humors and moistures, then... Such as cauterizing a tooth for pain, it may not return, at least in some cases.
And while the common belief is that cauterization is the ultimate remedy, it is not correct in their view, for they believe that no treatment with medication or otherwise can be effective after cauterization, which is not the case.
The meaning of cauterization being the 'ultimate remedy' is not that we abandon all other treatments, but rather, if we have attempted various remedies for an illness without success, and then finally resort to cauterization, which proves effective, then in this context, cauterization can be considered the ultimate remedy. Not according to the common understanding nor to the errors of many ignorant physicians.
The ancients stated that cauterization with gold is better than with iron, as they believed in the moderation and noble nature of gold. They claimed that it does not cause inflammation at the site of application, which is entirely false.
For I have experimented with it and found that its effect varies from one body to another, and cauterization with gold is better and more beneficial than with iron, as they claimed. However, when you heat the iron in the fire made of gold, you will not be able to determine when it reaches the desired temperature due to the red hue of gold.
Since it is subject to rapid cooling, and if you increase its heat during fever, it melts in the fire and becomes liquid, which leads the practitioner into difficulty. That is why cauterization with iron has become faster and more appropriate for our work, God willing.
I have organized this chapter on cauterization in sections, from the head to the foot, to make it easy for the student to find what they need, God willing.
Chapter One.
One cauterization for the head.
This method is effective against the moisture and cold that overwhelm the brain, causing headaches, frequent discharge from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and throat pains. In general, it is useful for any condition resulting from coldness, such as paralysis, seizures, aphasia, and other similar ailments.
The method involves, first, ordering the patient to induce vomiting with a purgative that purifies the head for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and habitual condition.
Then, he is commanded to shave his head with a razor and sit between your hands, with his hands on his chest.
Then, you place the palm of your hand on the bridge of his nose between his eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then, heat the oil-soaked iron (as depicted below).
The skin should be opened to the depth of a small bone, or as large as a cumin seed. If you pull your hand away, use the same iron (or another) to apply pressure if it cools down. Until you can see the bone as I have described, take some salt and dissolve it in water, then dip a cotton swab in it and apply it to the area, leaving it for three days.
Then take a cotton swab soaked in lard and apply it, leaving it until the inflammation from the fire subsides, then treat it with the quadruple ointment until it heals, God willing.
They say that the wound, the longer it remains open, the more pus it produces, which is better and more beneficial.
Some mention that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, holding the iron until some of the bone thickness burns away, then stripping off the burned portion of the bone and treating it afterward.
Others claim that cauterization should be done excessively, so it strongly affects the bone until it falls out, like amber or a small flake, and they assert that this releases vapors from the head and keeps the wound open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals, but I never use these types of cauterization except on certain people and, in my opinion, leaving it as it is is better, if it does not interfere with the natural connection of the head, as we have observed in other parts.
Especially when the patient's head is weak by nature, the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion, and it is this that I have used and recommend.
Chapter Two.
On the head as well.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and persists for a long time, and treatments such as cauterization, cups, applicators, poultices, ointments, and bandages are used without relief, especially if the initial cauterization described has been ineffective, then consider the following. If the patient's head is strong in structure naturally and is not weak, and they experience severe coldness, then apply another cauterization slightly above the initial one. Then apply cauterization to each temple of the head until the thickness of the skin decreases and it reveals the desired amount from the bone. Apply cauterization to the back of the head, in the area known as the occiput, and be gentle with your hand so as not to expose the bone. The patient will experience severe pain from this cauterization, unlike any other pain caused by cauterization on the head. I will mention this particular cauterization at its appropriate place.
The iron used to treat the fore and rear horns of the head should be milder than the iron used for the central part of the head. And this is its image.
Chapter III.
In the treatment of a non-chronic fracture.
If a fracture of the head causes pain with a headache that radiates to the eye, and the patient vomits after taking purifying drugs for the head, and all other treatments mentioned in the classifications of diseases do not help, then there are two ways to apply heat in this case. Either apply heat with a sharp, burning drug or use iron.
As for applying heat with a burning drug, take one garlic clove, peel it and cut off both ends, then use a wide knife to make an incision in the affected area on the side of the head (temple) to create a space beneath the skin where the garlic clove can be placed.
It should be inserted beneath the skin until it disappears, then secure it tightly with bands and leave it for approximately fifteen hours. After that, remove the bandages, take out the garlic clove, and let the wound heal for two or three days before covering it.
On it, apply a cotton ball soaked in lard to the affected area until it suppures, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you prefer, you can use some of the burning drugs mentioned in the eighteenth article on burning drugs.
As for burning with iron, it is done in this manner: heat the iron with this shape.
It is called the nail iron because its head resembles a nail, with some indentations and a small protrusion in the center.
Then place it on the affected area and hold your hand while rotating the iron slightly, so that the amount burned is no more than half the thickness of the skin. Lift your hand to avoid burning the artery below, which could cause bleeding, then soak a cotton ball in salt water and apply it to the area, leaving it for three days. Then apply the cotton ball soaked in lard, treating it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you prefer, seal this wound with the sharp edge of the iron, taking care not to cut the artery in non-chronic wounds, especially.
Chapter Four.
On Chronic Hemorrhage.
If the treatment for hemorrhoids, as described above and in the divisions of diseases, is ineffective, and you observe a condition that precludes the use of the initial cauterization with medication or fire, then... The surgical scalpel should then be heated until it becomes blistered, after which you draw a line along the affected area with your finger, approximately half a finger's length, and apply pressure once to cut the vessel, reaching towards the bone.
However, you must be cautious to avoid damaging the jaw joint's mobility during chewing, which could burn the muscle or nerve controlling it, leading to spasms.
Be extremely careful and watchful for any bleeding from the artery you've cut; its vessels are filled with vital (groins). Especially for those who lack knowledge of the procedure, it is better to refrain from acting and seek guidance from experienced practitioners.
Further details on managing spontaneous bleeding from arteries, as well as the cauterization techniques mentioned earlier, will be discussed in this text, if God wills. If you encounter a condition that these treatments cannot address...
I observed the sick body to be amenable to a cauterization in the middle of the head as we have described, and treated the wound so that it may heal, God willing.
If you wish, you may use the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on arterial bleeding using a hot iron with two blades, for it is a better and more effective treatment.
Chapter V.
On the pains of the ears.
If a pain in the ear occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other remedies mentioned in the divisions, but the pain persists, apply the hot iron, which is called the "point" with this shape.
Then, after heating it, apply the iron around the entire ear, or around both ears if the pain is in them. After locating the point with ink, apply the hot iron slightly away from the origin of the ear, making each cauterization about ten drops in each ear or similar, and then treat the wounds until they heal, God willing.
Chapter VI.
In your strength.
The strength that is treated with cautery is of the type that occurs from phlegm, as I mentioned in the divisions of diseases.
And one should avoid cautery of the type that occurs from dryness and nerve spasms.
When cautery with poultices, applications, and gargles does not heal this type of strength, then the patient should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly lower on the cheek, and the third at the junction of the lips.
And make your cautery from the opposite side of the diseased area, because relaxation occurs only on the side that appears healthy.
The image of cautery is to make a single cauterization opposite the upper corner of the ear, slightly below the brow, and another in the temple, with a length equal to the thumb.
Lower your cautery hand to burn at a depth of half the thickness of the skin. This is an image of the iron, which is a type of knife as described earlier, but slightly milder. The knife should have a slight excess of thickness, then the site should be treated as mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter VII.
In the case of chronic paralysis.
If the paralysis becomes chronic and treatment with what we mentioned does not take effect, and there is no fever in the patient, apply four leech bites. Apply a leech bite on each temple and one in the middle of the forehead, as mentioned, and another at the back of the head, following the same method.
The application of heat, as mentioned above, can also be done with a leech bite on the stomach, which is even more effective, then treated using the methods previously described.
Chapter VIII.
On forgetfulness.
For one who suffers from forgetfulness due to phlegm, the patient should be given warm drinks and large quantities of diuretics and brain-cleansing grains.
Then he shaves all his head, and a poultice of mustard, as described in the article on poultices, is applied to his rear. Carrying it several times, it acts like cauterization.
Do the same as mentioned there, and if he recovers, otherwise, three cauterizations are applied to his rear of the head, aligned from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
Make a space between each cauterization, as thick as a finger, and then treat the cauterization with what has been mentioned before. If you wish to add more, and if the patient can tolerate it, then make another cauterization in the middle one.
If you wish to add more, make two cauterizations on the horns, and then treat it until he recovers, with a cauterizing instrument in the shape of an olive as mentioned before.
Chapter IX
For treating paralysis and relaxing all the body.
It is necessary to purify the head with aromatic herbs as mentioned, then shave the patient's head, and cauterize a cut in the middle of the head, and a cauterization on each horn of the head, and a cauterization on its rear.
Three on the vertebrae of the neck, if, in the event of a bodily weakness, you need more than that and the patient is capable of tolerating it and the illness is strong and well-established, then apply four burns to the vertebrae of his back. And continue with the burns until most of the skin is burned off, then raise your hand and treat it as mentioned earlier, so that it may heal, God willing. The iron should be olive-shaped.
Chapter X.
On seizures.
Only the person suffering from a seizure caused by phlegm should be burned, after first purifying his brain with powerful purgatives and other treatments mentioned in the previous sections, if the patient is old and capable of taking medicine.
However, if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then use gargles and a cleansing paste for the brain several days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then he should shave his head, and apply one burn in the middle of the head as described earlier, and another burn at the back. And on each side of his head, make a burn, if the patient is strong and tolerable, then apply the burns as mentioned for the one with paralysis, relaxing the body over the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and the iron should be olive-shaped as described previously.
If the patient is a child, then make the iron gentle in this manner.
Chapter XI.
On the burn for melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is putrefied humours and thick phlegm, then apply the burns as mentioned for the one with paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is a dark, inclined humour and the patient's body is putrefied, then purge his brain as described in the previous division.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake from linen in the shape of a circle, and place it in the middle of his head while he sits cross-legged, holding it from all sides. Then take one pound of ancient sheep fat.
Then heat it over a moderate fire until the finger can tolerate it when inserted, then empty it onto the patient's head in the shape of a circle and leave it until it cools. Repeat this process for the patient once a week, along with all other good care, until he heals, God willing.
If you wish to treat it, apply many small drops without holding the iron with your hand, but through steaming. This type of burning moistens the brain gently.
Then apply a cotton ball soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
In the burning of water that descends into the eye.
If you notice the onset of water descending into the eye, as described in the previous sections, act swiftly to purify and protect the afflicted individual's head from all moistures. Bathe them in a hot bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave their head and apply a burn to the middle of their head, followed by two burns on each temple. If water begins to descend into both eyes or just one, proceed accordingly.
Then, using the iron, cut all veins and arteries beneath the skin, making sure to apply a burn that is both long and wide across each temple. Be cautious to prevent blood loss.
If you notice any of it, cut it off at the base with any means available to you. We will discuss later the wisdom of clamping and cutting arteries while preventing blood loss.
A burn may be made on the nape of the neck between two vertebrae with severe, powerful cauterization.
Chapter XIII.
In the treatment of chronic tear discharge.
If the tear discharge from the eyes is chronic and persistent, and it is found to be due to swollen veins and arteries on the surface of the head outside the eye, and you are certain that this is caused by a thick cold effusion in the lymphatic system, then apply the cauterization as described earlier for the initial stage of the water discharge. Cauterization in the middle of the head, two cauterizations on the temples, and two beneath the vertebrae at the nape of the neck. If further relief is required, apply an additional cauterization on each side of the eye, just above the eyebrow with a small iron.
Chapter XIV.
On cauterizing the nasal cavity.
If the treatment as described in the previous sections is unsuccessful, then immediately proceed to remove the nasal polyps over three nights, and afterward, shave the patient's head and apply a cauterization with the oil iron (mukawwa al-zaytuniya) to the central wound. Then apply the iron (coating) in two heats above the eyebrows, slightly below the hair, and be cautious of the artery, do not cut it, and this is a picture of the (iron) coating.
Chapter XV.
In the process of relaxing the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to illness or moisture, apply one heat with this horseshoe iron.
And if you wish, apply them above the eyebrows slightly, with two heats on each side, and separate them from the temples, so that each heat is as long as the eyebrow.
And do not overdo the heat with your hand, but only as much as burns one-third of the skin, and the iron should be of this form.
Chapter XVI.
In the process of applying heat to the eyelid.
If the eyelids turn inward, there are two types of heat to apply. Either by burning with fire or by burning medicine, if by fire, instruct the patient to remove their beard, if it is one that is plucked, until it grows long and even.
If you pluck it while it is young, bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so they do not move until it grows and straightens. Once it has grown and leveled out, place the patient's head in your lap, then draw on the eyelid with ink a sign in the shape of an Asian tree leaf.
The sign should begin near the lashes, then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or alfalfa saliva under the eyelid. Heat a heated iron to this shape.
Then, burn the shape you drew little by little in many sessions until the skin surface is burned, forming the shape of an Asian tree leaf, entirely visible. The mark of successful work is that the eyelid will be puffy and the hair around the eye will stand up from the eye socket.
Then, raise your hand and leave it for three days. After that, apply a cotton ball dipped in lard to remove the crust, and treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair returns after some time and the eyelid relaxes, repeat the process.
If the hair is on the lower eyelid, burn it again in the same way as before, until it returns to its natural position and does not affect the eye. For burning with a hot medicine, instruct the patient to let their lashes grow long and even.
Then, make a paper from the bark of the Asia tree, and take from the usual soap and unquenched lime, each weighing a drachm or its equivalent, and crush them both thoroughly. Do this quickly to prevent drying. Then, you lay it flat on the paper made from the bark of the Asia tree, placing it over one or both eyes. Under the eye, place a cotton ball soaked in egg white and rest your head on a pillow.
Place your index finger on the medication, press slightly, and move it as the patient feels the burning sensation, as it will feel like fire. As long as they feel the burn, continue to move it. If the burning stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Observe: if the eyelid raises as it does when exposed to fire or a cut, then you have successfully applied the treatment. If not, reapply the medicine to the areas that did not respond or turn black until your work is complete. Then, place a cotton ball coated in butter on the eye to soothe the burning sensation.
Then, treat it with a palm butter ointment or similar until it heals. When treating, be extremely careful not to let any of the medication fall into the eye. If after a few days the eyelid relaxes and there is concern about hair falling into the eye, repeat the treatment.
Then prepare the medicine again on that part of the eyelid which has relaxed, specifically as you did initially, and treat it until it heals, and this is a figure of the leaf of the Asian tree.
Know that people's eyes may differ in size and shape, so let your tightness be according to that, and the path to correctness is not hidden from one who has experience in this craft.
Chapter XVII
On the treatment of the abscess that appears in the corner of the eye.
If you treat the abscess as we mentioned in the classifications of diseases and it does not respond to your treatment, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
Order the patient to place his head on your lap, and have a servant hold his head with both hands, firmly but without jostling it.
Then place a wet cotton ball in the white of an egg or in the saliva of a lizard on his eyes, and heat the iron in the following manner.
It should be hollow like a feather tube from one end, where the cauterization takes place, and if you prefer, it can have a perforated other end or be solid like a rod, but this hollow shape is better for your work, God willing.
Then, if the fistula is open, press it and extract the pus and dry it; or if it is not open, open it and extract the pus. Then apply a hot iron to it, which will be very soothing, and hold it with your hand until you reach the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose so that your hand does not mistake or disturb the patient, causing the iron to fall into the eye and damage it; if it reaches the bone in the first application, otherwise, reapply the iron if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball with butter and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals; if it does not heal after forty days, apply a sharp, corrosive medicine to expose the bone and remove it as mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
There is another method of treating a fistula mentioned by some early scholars: direct your attention to the site of the fistula, make a small incision there, and insert a thin brass cap into the same opening. This is its image.
Pour into it, in a melted state, the weight of a drachma of lead, holding the cap firmly with your hand; the patient must not move at all so that the molten lead does not enter his eye. It is necessary to place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
If lead burns the site of the fistula, it will heal in a remarkable manner. If the fistula heals as mentioned through cauterization and treatment, otherwise, it is mandatory to use the nose hole and return the fistula to the nasal passage as will be explained in its specific section.
**Chapter XVIII**
**On Cauterizing a Lip Fistula**
**On Treating a Lip Rift (Fistula)**
The cavity should be made with the precision of a knife, then place it protectively with the wheel in the same fissure until the cauterization reaches the depth of the fissure, and then treat it with the curette until it heals, God willing.
Chapter XIX
On the cauterization of the naphthys (ulcer) occurring in the mouth.
If a tumor appears in the gum, or in the soft palate, or at the base of the teeth, and becomes ulcerated, drains, and forms a naphthys (ulcer) that exudes pus, and treatment does not take effect, then one should heat an instrument to the extent that it fits into the naphthys.
Then insert it protectively into the naphthys' hole and hold your hand until the heated metal reaches its depth, repeating this process once or twice, then treat it with the mentioned remedies until it heals, God willing.
If the material (cauterization) falls off and it heals, otherwise, the place should be examined, and the corrupt bone should be removed as mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter XX
In dealing with loose teeth and gums.
If the gums become relaxed by moisture, and the teeth move, treat them with medications, but if they do not improve, place the patient's head in your lap and then apply the iron (as depicted later), after placing a pipe on the tooth.
The iron is inserted with a wheel, and you hold it slightly so the patient feels the heat of the fire reach the root of the tooth, then remove your hand, and repeat this process several times as desired, then have the patient rinse their mouth with salt water.
It is held for an hour and then thrown away, for the moving tooth will be stabilized, the relaxed gums will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will evaporate.
Chapter 21.
For toothache.
If the toothache is due to cold or has a worm, and medications do not help, there are two methods of treatment: either apply hot butter or apply heat from fire.
As for the hot butter treatment, take fresh butter and boil it in a metal bowl or shell, then take a cotton ball, wrap it around the end of a rod, dip it in the boiling butter, and apply it to the aching tooth with a wheel, holding it until it cools.
Then repeat this process until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. If you wish, immerse a piece of wool or cotton in cold lard and place it on the painful tooth, then put a hot iron on top until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
And for burning it with fire, you should take a copper or iron tube that has some thickness to prevent the heat of the fire from reaching the patient's mouth, then heat the iron in a way that its shape is preserved and place it on the tooth, while holding your hand until the iron cools down, repeating this process several times.
The pain will either disappear that very day or on another day; after the burning, the patient should fill their mouth with good lard, hold it for a while, then spit it out, and this is the shape of the iron.
Burn with any side you choose, according to what is possible, and this is the shape of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Second.
On burning swine.
If the swine is afflicted with phlegm and cold humors, and does not yield to medications for maturation, and you wish for a rapid maturation, then heat the hollow iron in both ends, as illustrated here.
To make smoke emerge from the burned area, apply the hot iron shield-like over the tumor once or twice, depending on need, until you reach the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, adjust the size of the iron to match the tumor.
Then leave it for three days, and apply a cotton ball soaked in lard to it until the burnt parts heal, then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
Chapter XXIII.
For burns affecting the throat and causing difficulty breathing.
If moisture dominates the trachea, especially if it is accompanied by cold temperament, the patient should first be induced to vomit with facilitative drugs, then apply a hot iron to the throat at the base of the neck, in the lower region.
Be cautious not to reach the throat with the hot iron, and only burn the skin halfway. Then apply another hot iron at the joint of the neck, at its lowest point, making it nail-like, in the manner previously described.
Then treat it with the methods mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter XXIV.
On the conditions of the lung and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and there is no fever or consumption, and the condition is chronic, apply two cauterizations above the clavicles in the lower, soft, hollow places, and another in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be nail-like, as described previously. If desired, use a dropper cauterization with the instrument called the "dotter," whose image has been presented earlier, for the pain of the ear, and make drops of thirty or so.
Then treat it as mentioned earlier until healing occurs. You can also make a cautery with three prongs, as illustrated, and apply it quickly because in one pass, you cauterize three times. This is the image of the cautery.
Chapter XXV.
Cauterization of the armpit.
If the head of the arm becomes dislocated due to slippery humors, or it does not set properly when reduced, and it keeps becoming dislocated upon movement, as we have observed, then the joint should be reduced first. Then, the patient should lie on their back or on their right side. Then, lift the skin inside the armpit upwards with your left hand's fingers if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then, heat the iron with two handles as shown here.
Then, use the iron to burn the skin until it reaches the other side. The shape of the burn will be four burns, and it can be done with an iron having three handles, making the shape six burns, with the handles on the soft tissue.
And this is the image of the iron with three handles.
It can also be increased by one, making the burns eight, then apply hot balls pounded with salt to the burn and have the patient rest without moving the limb until it strengthens, although dislocation upwards is rare.
Apply a single nail-like burn above the joint or several burns that drip, for the joint becomes firm and the moisture disappears, and the patient heals.
Chapter 26.
On the burn of the stomach.
If there is cold and excessive moisture in the stomach, causing it to lose its balance, with frequent discharge and treatment attempts without success, the patient should lie on their back, extend their legs and arms, and apply three burns. Apply a burn under the chest with a clamp equal to a finger, and below each side of the burn, make two more burns to form a triangular shape, and space them apart so they do not overlap in case of healing. The depth of the burn should be two-thirds of the skin's thickness, and the shape of the burns should be as described.
As shown in this image, to this extent without exceeding it.
If desired, you can apply a single large burn in the middle of the stomach as shown in this image.
The clamp used for this single burn should be shaped as a circle, as shown in this image.
If the patient is severely distressed from this burn, you can make dots on the stomach with ink to indicate the extent of the damage. Then, apply a dot-shaped burn with a pointed clamp, followed by appropriate treatment until healing occurs.
Chapter 27.
On the Coldness of the Liver
If liver pain is due to coldness, moisture, or a putrid wind that exceeds its natural condition, and the patient undergoes the treatments mentioned in the previous sections without improvement, then other methods must be employed. The patient should lie on their back, and with a reed, three burns should be made on the liver below the ribcage, at the point where the human elbow ends.
After each burn, leave a thickness of the finger and make the burn straight along the body, without pressing the reed with excessive force.
The burn should not exceed half the thickness of the skin. If the patient cannot stand, they should lie down with their legs extended and arms raised, resembling the shape of the reed.
It is possible to make these burns with a sharp iron if you have skill and caution, preventing excessive burning that might affect the entire skin, leading to abdominal burns and reaching the intestines. The skin there is thin, so be mindful.
Chapter 28.
In a case of a tumor in the liver, apply heat.
If a pus forms in the liver, and you wish to determine whether the tumor is within the liver tissue or its capsule, it will weigh heavily on the patient and cause pain without being sharp.
If it is within the liver capsule, there will be a sharp pain with severe fatigue, and if the doctors have been unable to treat it, the patient should lie on their back and then mark the affected area with ink.
Then heat the iron in the fire, an iron similar to a mill, as shown here. Apply it with one burn, burning the entire skin, and continue burning until you reach the capsule, so that all the pus is extracted. Then treat it as a wound to heal.
This type of burning should only be used by those well-versed in medicine, who have frequently practiced these procedures and are familiar with them through experience. It is better to leave it to them.
Chapter 29.
In the treatment of cancer.
The ancients mentioned the use of wormwood (arzaud) in cancer treatment, stating that one should take a single, longer piece of dried wormwood stem, as thin as a finger, and soak it in oil before heating it over fire. Then apply a single burn between the clavicle and the neck, and two small burns just below the glands, tilted towards the side under the beard. Also, apply two large burns above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
Apply two more burns between the fifth and sixth ribs, tilted slightly to the rear, as well as a burn in the middle of the chest and another one above the stomach. Additionally, perform three burns from behind, one between the shoulders and two on the sides below the ribcage, opposite the burn between the clavicle and neck.
One should not insert the burn deeply into the skin, but rather apply it to the surface, like a seal. Some ancient texts mention individuals who used a heated iron rod shaped like a wedge, inserting it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself.
The duration of treatment, as we mentioned for liver cancer, involves burns in this manner, and this method has risks. Either the patient dies immediately or a fistula develops at the site, which is incurable.
Chapter Thirty
On the spleen.
If the treatment for the spleen as mentioned in the previous section does not take effect, there are three correct options: to burn it with three or four burns arranged along the length of the spleen.
In the form of liver burns, which present as a series of burns with a width equal to or slightly more than the thickness of a finger, and with the same characteristics as described for liver burns. Place the patient on their back without excessively deep penetration with the burn instrument.
The other option involves the axilla (armpit). Lift the skin facing the spleen where the patient's left arm ends, and lift the skin across the width of the body so that the burns fall along the length of the body.
Then, insert the instruments with great care until they pass through the skin on the other side. Remove the instrument and make four burns, or if you prefer, three burns with the other instrument.
Then, treat the burn site after allowing it to drain pus for several days; this is more effective than all other treatments mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In cases of edema.
The method of applying heat (kīy) is effective only in cases of edema that is particularly hard and resistant to treatment, after trying various remedies without success. One should apply four applications of heat around the navel and one application on the stomach.
Apply another application of heat to the liver, one to the spleen, and two behind the ribs, one facing the chest and one facing the stomach. The depth of the heat application should be close to the thickness of the skin, and then leave the heat treatment open to allow pus to drain for a long time.
Do not withhold treatment from the patient after applying heat, as it is essential to combine various remedies to accelerate healing. The shape of the heat application on the back should be nail-like, as previously described, and the one applied to the stomach should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
In cases of heat application to the feet and legs.
If the feet and legs swell due to edema and are filled with yellow water, one should apply heat on the back of the foot at the point between the little toe and the ring finger.
And establish your hand with the iron, and do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not lower it again, for it exudes the yellow water, and the iron should be in this shape.
Then, apply the iron to the legs in two places on each leg, and the iron should be applied with the sharp end of the iron, one place below the knee and another lower down towards the middle of the leg, and on each thigh, apply the iron in two places.
Leave the iron open without treatment for a long time, and it will exude water, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the iron for diarrhea.
If diarrhea is due to cold and moisture, weakening the grip and digestive forces in the stomach and intestines, and various treatments have been ineffective, and you see the patient capable of enduring it, with strong strength, then apply a large iron to their stomach. As mentioned earlier, apply to the stomach with a circular iron and four irons around the navel, gently with a delicate iron, and an iron on a piece of cotton above the coccyx, or two large irons.
If you observe abundant moistures and the patient is susceptible to it, then apply a cauterization on the groin and another on each side (of the body), and possibly add two small cauterizations near the larger one on the stomach. It is an effective treatment that will not fail, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids.
If there are chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, numerous or single, of thick, cold humors or putrid moistures, and if they have been treated as mentioned in the previous sections without success, then cauterize the patient with three incisions below the coccyx, slightly under the table, in a triangular shape.
Cauterize with two fingers below the navel, and if you think the patient's stomach has become cold and their food is not digesting well, and if you observe swelling in their face, cauterize the stomach with a large incision as mentioned previously, and another on the liver. And another on the spleen with a nail-like iron, leaving the cauterization open for some time, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the removal of warts.
After cutting it, if you cut off a wart, take a hot iron that resembles a V-shaped tool and insert it gently into the same cut wart while applying pressure with your hand until the iron reaches the duct from which blood is flowing. Do this once or twice.
If warts are numerous, cut each one with a hot iron as described above and then treat them with suitable ointments until they heal. If you burn a large wart on cotton, it will be even more effective.
Chapter 36.
On the removal of abscesses that occur in the buttocks and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and treatment as described in its proper place, or if they refuse, it is possible that they will heal with cauterization. If an abscess occurs and pus and corrupt humors flow from it, first measure it with a fine probe.
Then, determine the depth of its entrance with a probe. Take a hot iron that resembles a V-shaped tool and insert it gently into the abscess along the same path as the probe, straightening the course of the abscess and according to how far the probe entered. Apply cauterization to it once or twice or three times, as needed, until all those corrupt bodies are burned.
Beware of burning a nerve if present, or a significant vessel, especially if the fistula drains into the bladder or into the intestinal tract.
Beware of these locations, and only proceed if the fistula is in a soft place and you judge that it is not permeable. Then treat the area until it heals, for if the wound closes, stops exuding, and remains so for some time, then know that it has healed completely.
And if it continues to exude, know that it is permeable or there is a rotten bone or something similar within it, as will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter 37.
On the kidney stone.
If it occurs in the kidneys, accompanied by pain due to cold or a severe chill, and as a result, the patient's strength is reduced, then one should apply heat to both kidneys using the copper spatula mentioned earlier, and possibly a third application on the same table, resulting in three consecutive applications, which will be more beneficial.
Chapter 38.
On the Bladder Stone
If there is weakness and relaxation in the bladder from cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then make a cauterization below the navel on the bladder where the hair of the groin begins, and another cauterization to the right of the navel and another to the left.
After cauterizing from each side, make it to the extent of the thumb joint, and cauterize at the lower back, or two cauterizations if necessary, and let the iron be nail-like as mentioned above.
Chapter Thirty-Nine
On the Uterine Cauterization
If there is a substance in the uterus due to cold and dampness that prevents the conception, corrupt the womb, and make its discharge difficult, or if it causes pain upon its arrival, then cauterize three times around the navel as we mentioned in the bladder cauterization. Cauterize with a iron rod below the back, or two cauterizations, and let the iron be nail-like.
Chapter Forty
In this way, dislocate the hip.
Mistaken moisture can lead to the dislocation of the hip, causing one leg to appear longer than the other when measured. If you find a gap at the site of dislocation, it is necessary to apply a semi-circular burn to the patient directly on the hip joint.
After marking around the hip joint with a pen to ensure it is centered within the circle, and if you do not have the specialized cauterizing iron depicted in the illustration, make three burns using a large olive oil-soaked cauterizing iron.
Ensure the burn has a depth equal to the thickness of the skin and then treat the area until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-One.
Cauterizing the sciatic nerve.
If pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and moisture, and the treatment mentioned in the previous section is ineffective, the patient should be given a remedy to ease the thick humors, such as putrid alum or sap of the prickly pear plant, and similar substances.
Then, apply the caustic to the face in two ways: either with burnishing drugs or with fire. The burning with fire can be done in many faces, one of which is to burn on the right hip itself three triangular burns like this picture shows.
It should be done in a way that creates a suitable depth, with each burn separated by the thickness of a finger. The iron should be olive-shaped, and a single burn can be made in the middle on the hip itself, forming four burns. If desired, you can apply this in a circular pattern as mentioned earlier for the dislocation of the hip, making one burn.
The circle should enclose the entire hip and burn through all the skin thickness, this is the description of the burning in sciatica if the pain persists only in the hip itself without extending to the thigh or leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, apply two burns on the thigh at the place indicated by the patient as painful, and a single burn above the ankle with four fingers towards the outer side, using a scissor-shaped iron. The depth of the burn should be just through the skin thickness.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends to the toes, apply burns with a point-shaped iron at the place of his indication, three or four or more if necessary. If he points to the pain below the knee towards the leg, apply a single burn with a scissor-shaped iron there.
Be cautious in all incisions, ensuring that the cut does not reach a nerve or major artery, as this may cause harm to the patient or lead to complications.
I have seen cases where individuals had incisions above the ankle, with excessive cauterization, leading to gangrene that extended to the foot, causing it to rot completely. This resulted in severe diarrhea and, subsequently, death. In such instances, apply the same treatment to both sides.
Some wise scholars have described a procedure for incising the hip, creating a cylinder of iron with a diameter of half a span, and an opening at the top slightly smaller than the pit of a date palm. Inside this cylinder, they insert a smaller cylinder, followed by another one.
After inserting each cylinder, leave a space equal to the thickness of the thumb between them. The cylinders should be open on both sides and have a height of approximately one or two spans. A handle made of secure iron should be attached to these cylinders, as illustrated.
Then, heat it in the fire until it turns red and emits sparks. Place it on the patient's hip, with the individual resting on their right side. Apply three circular incisions at once, leaving them uncovered for three days, then dress the wound with butter, keeping it open for several days.
Many times, then, treat it with a poultice until it heals. The author of this book states that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its severity and the terror it instills, as well as the few people in our land who can bear it. However, for those who do endure it, it is excellent cauterization if applied correctly.
And as for cauterization with burning drugs, it involves making two hollow cups, similar in shape to a door hinge, from copper or iron.
They should have a height of approximately two finger-widths and be open at the bottom and top, with one cup slightly larger than the other, joined together as shown.
Then lower them onto the right hip of the patient, who is lying on their healthy side, securing your hand firmly. Pour water between the two cups, slightly warmed over a fire for about an hour, and have the patient endure its stinging and burning sensation for as long as an hour-long sand timer runs.
Until the stinging subsides, then raise your hand and wipe the stinging water off the hip with fresh water. Leave it for three days, applying butter to aid healing. After several more days, the pus will drain, indicating maximum benefit.
Then treat it with poultices until it heals. If the pain spreads to the thigh or leg, create a mold for it, holding water in the same manner as the hip, as described in the article on preparing medicinal poultices.
Take from saltpeter and unquenched lime a portion from each, grind them, and place them in a new pot with a small hole at the bottom, large enough to accommodate the rod, and place another pot underneath, lined with clay.
Add fresh water to the saltpeter and lime, immersing them with your finger after tightly mixing them in your hand. Leave the pot until the hot water has settled at the bottom of the clay pot, then gather all the water and pour it over new saltpeter and lime.
It becomes extremely sharp, playing a crucial role in various surgical procedures and treating various conditions, akin to the effect of fire. Among the medications that use this method are fennel, honey from mullein, and lime with soap, all applied topically.
Galen recounts a story of an ancient man who treated hip pain, sciatica, and bone fractures with remarkable success, claiming that his method required no other treatment and cured patients in a single application.
Even if he had to be carried into the bath and emerged cured, it is said that he would use green nard (a type of resin) if available, or, if not, modern dried nard, finely ground and mixed with some fat, applied topically to the affected area, such as the hip, thigh, or leg.
Stretch and leave it for three hours or until the patient feels the burning sensation subside. Then, immerse them in a bath, and if their body has cooled down, place them in a basin. The pain will cease and heal with God's permission. If it does not heal, repeat the dressing after ten days.
It will heal, by the will of God. Know that no one should use heat with these remedies unless the body has been emptied, and Diascorides mentioned that goat's sweat, when applied as heat, is beneficial for sciatica.
The heat should be applied in this manner: take wool and soak it in old oil, then place it on the deep area between the thumb and the wrist, closer to the wrist. Then, take dried goat's sweat.
Then, ignite it over fire until it becomes a hot coal. Place this on the wool and let it cool down. Take another one and repeat the process until sensation reaches the thigh through the upper arm, and the pain subsides with God's permission. This type of heat treatment is called 'kai al-ba'ar' (heat from goat's sweat).
Chapter Forty-Two.
In heat treatment for back pain.
Pain in the back may result from numerous causes, such as a fall, a blow, or excessive vomiting, and is often due to the accumulation of cold, moist fluid. The application of heat is indicated for this specific condition alone.
After vomiting, the patient should be treated with a warm compress on their back, where the pain is located. This involves three rows of hot applications across the table's width, with each row containing five or more applications, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength.
The application of heat should be done using a hot compress or, alternatively, three to four applications with a medium nail-shaped iron, as shown.
Chapter 34.
In the initial treatment of a curvature (hunchback).
This condition often affects young children, and its initial sign is shortness of breath during physical activity and movement. In the lower back, you can feel a prominent bone that stands out among the others.
If you observe these signs and wish to prevent further progression, apply a hot compress in the form of a circle, as illustrated. To apply the cauterizing iron to each side of the vertebra evenly, and if you wish, you can surround the vertebra with the cautery iron in two or three rows, making the dots close to one another. Then treat the site until it heals as we have mentioned.
Beware of using the cautery on the curvature that results from nerve spasm.
Chapter Forty-Four
On the cauterization of gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are caused by cold moistures that accumulate in any part of the body, and if these pains occur in the legs, then physicians usually call it a special type of gout.
If the cold gout, caused by the remedies mentioned in the divisions does not disappear, then cauterization can be used to alleviate the pain. This is done by applying multiple cautery irons around the ankle joints after induced vomiting, using a medium-sized olive oil iron, as depicted here.
If you need to apply drops on the face, use a point iron. If the pains rise to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four irons from each side using the same olive oil iron.
If further heat is required, apply it and do not insert your hand too deeply into the heat, but only to the thickness of the skin. If the pains rise to the hips or back, use the heat as mentioned in its section.
If the pains are only in the hands, then apply drops around the wrists as if you were forming two rows; if the pains remain in the fingers, apply them to each joint and on the palm, and if after several days the pains rise to the elbows or shoulders, do as mentioned for them.
Remove them from all sides, and do not neglect the patient's treatment and medication. If they improve their diet, expel mucus, and follow this heat, they will recover, God willing.
Chapter LIV.
On the heat for hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some of the intestines and fat descend to the testicles, and this is a recent onset, you should order the patient to stop eating for a day and use laxatives to facilitate the passage of stool from the abdomen.
Then make the patient lie on their back between your hands, and order them to hold themselves until the fat or intestines protrude. Then push it back with your finger and mark below the hernia on the pubic bone with a sign resembling a half-circle, whose ends point upwards towards the body.
Then, heat the iron in this manner.
Until a white muscle appears that sparks, then returns the intestines or wound to its place inside, then the servant places his hand on the spot so that the intestines do not protrude, and the sick person's legs are separated, and a cushion is placed under him, and another servant ties his legs.
And another servant holds his hands, then the iron is lowered to the same mark, and your hand with the iron stands straight and you hold it until it reaches the bone or returns it if it did not reach the first one.
Be careful not to let the intestines protrude during the cauterization, otherwise you may burn it, causing either death or great harm to the patient; know that when you do not reach the bone with the cauterization, your work will be unsuccessful, and the iron should be gentle for children according to their size and for adults according to their size.
Then, after three days, treat the cauterization site with lard until the scorch of the fire disappears, then treat it with all kinds of ointments until it heals; the patient should lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
You should make his diet during the treatment period soft to relax his stomach, preventing the intestines from protruding when turning or defecating; then, after forty days if he wants to stand up, use a tight bandage and secure it for another forty days, reducing exhaustion, bloating from food and drink, and excessive screaming.
If this treatment is applied in this manner, it will heal completely, God willing. I will mention the treatment of hernias by incising them in their proper section, God willing. As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is newly developed, if you want to prevent its increase, remove the hernia with a round cauterization according to its size. If you burn the skin, make it two-thirds of its size, then treat it as mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. Some of the ancients mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular iron in this manner.
After learning about hernias with the marker, make a line across the top of the hernia on one side and another line downward on the other side, then lower your hand with a single nail-like cauterization. The first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter LXIV
In the cauterization of the female.
If a pain occurs in one of the members due to a fall or a blow and this pain persists for a long time and does not improve with medication, it should be cauterized with a point iron, and each member should be cauterized according to its size, age, weakness, and strength.
If the pain and weakness persist after the initial burning, apply further heat. For these pains have a habit of spreading from one part to another close by, so it is necessary to follow them with heat until the patient recovers.
Chapter LXXIV.
On burning leprosy.
As for those with leprosy, heat can be of great benefit to them, especially the type of leprosy that results from putrefaction of phlegm and blackness.
If you wish to apply heat, examine it: if leprosy is in its early stages and treated as we have mentioned in the divisions, without diminution or stopping, and there is concern that corruption will take over all the humor of the patient, then make five burns on the head. One at the center of the head (as is customary), a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, two on the horns, and one from behind on the occipital bone, penetrating slightly with the heat so that it affects the bone a little.
Scabs will be removed, making it easier for the dense vapors to escape, and also applying further heat to the same area as mentioned before. If leprosy continues to affect the patient and becomes evident, these burns described on the head should be applied. Sutures and burns: One on the tip of the nose, two on the cheeks, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the thoracic vertebrae, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the spine, another above it on the same table, and two on the hips, one on each hip. Two on the knees, one on each knee; two on the elbows; two on the shoulder joints; two on the chest joints; a burn on every joint of his hands and feet, and on both heels, and on the forearms.
Be careful not to harm the nerve behind the heel bones, as you may burn them. You can make burns on the hip bone, the stomach's opening, and the liver. Know that the more burns you apply, the more effective and beneficial it will be.
Know that the sick do not feel the burns as deeply as the healthy, as their body is numbed. The size of the burns should be adjusted to the members and joints, as previously described regarding cauterization.
Then treat the burns with fine ashes, honey, and other remedies until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the case of numbness, when a body part is numbed and treated with drugs, oils, and dressings without healing, cut off the numb part according to what is suitable for the severity or lightness of the member, making sure not to exceed in cutting through the skin.
Then treat it with a poultice until it heals, and it may be cut for some numbness that occurs in the hand or foot at the vertebrae where the nerve emerges that moves that member, thus eliminating the numbness.
One should only proceed with this if they have a clear understanding of the anatomy of the members and the emergence of nerves that move the body.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
If leprosy becomes old and does not respond to any medical treatment, cauterize it with a cut of slight depth according to the thickness of the skin until the white disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with a paste of finely ground lentils, rose petal oil, and henna plant blood, or pigeon's blood or nettles' blood, mixing all in equal parts and applying the mixture to a cloth over the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On Cancer.
If cancer is in its early stage and you wish to stop it, apply a circular cautery around it as if it were spinning, and some scholars have said that a severe cautery should be made in the middle of it, but I do not agree with this, for I expect it to ulcerate, and I have seen this many times.
The correct method is to apply a circular cautery around it as we have said, or numerous small cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On Ganglions.
If a ganglion has formed and its maturation is delayed, either due to the inherent nature of the substance it contains, or because the patient is an old person with poor circulation, or due to the passage of time, and you wish to hasten its maturation, apply numerous small cauterizations around it in a punctilious manner.
Then leave it, for it will quickly mature. If you wish to hasten it with cautery, use an iron instrument in the following manner.
Insert it in the center of the abscess until it penetrates the skin, and let the scar be on what is below to facilitate the discharge of pus, then treat it as it should until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On the eating ulcer.
An ulcer is nothing but a corruption that moves within the member and devours it, just as fire consumes dry firewood. If you observe an ulcer in a place where it is possible to burn with fire, heat many small and large nails according to what is suitable for that place affected by the ulcer.
Then burn it from all sides until the corruption is entirely removed, leaving nothing at all, then leave it for three days and apply crushed sulfur with oil to the burned areas to remove all scabs and corrosion.
Then treat it with ointments that promote the growth of flesh. If, after three days, you observe that the flesh grows back healthy and free from corruption, then do not repeat the burning but rather continue treatment with sharp remedies.
It is like fire in its effectiveness, and I have mentioned its treatment with sharp remedies in the sections before; take it from there whenever needed.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the use of reverse and non-reverse nails.
This ailment often occurs in the soles of the feet, presenting as a rough and painful condition on the foot. It can be treated by heating either with fire or with sharp water.
As for treatment with fire, it involves heating a hollow iron tool shaped like a falcon's feather on all sides around the nail, ensuring its edge is thin. The heated tool is then applied to the nail, and the hand rotates the tool around the nail until the heat reaches the nail's core.
After leaving it for three days, allowing the pus to form, the treatment involves applying a compress of crushed wild fennel mixed with salt. The compress is left overnight, after which the nail is removed from its bed and the wound is treated with a healing ointment until full recovery. If the nails are not reversed.
This condition often occurs on the surface of the body, particularly on the hands and feet. Treatment involves using a tube of copper, iron, or falcon feather to press down on the nail or wart, then pouring a small amount of sharp water into the tube.
Hold your hand and as you rotate it, gently pinch your fingers to activate the edge of the tube at the base of the screw. Thus, the sharp water finds its way down to the root of the screw, and the patient endures a little discomfort from the sharp water for a moment.
Then leave it, for the screw will come out with its roots. Thus, you do this one by one until you have removed all of them from the body, then treat their sites after they are extracted with whatever ointments nourish the flesh.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On the fang of the tweezers.
If one of the tweezers becomes frozen due to cold or heat, or any other cause, you should apply four or five burns on the back's furrows, with a burn between each pair of furrows, and also a burn on his chest. And on his stomach, apply a burn with the olive iron; thus, the tweezers will calm down and hasten the maturation of the cold illness.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On the cauterizing instrument for the ulcer occurring in the body.
When ugly pustules appear in the body due to cold, thick, corrupt materials, they should be cauterized at their first emergence with a gentle burn using a reed stick whose tip has been ignited, or with the root of long turmeric, or with a lens-shaped iron.
The fistula should be cauterized in this manner at its first appearance, so that it does not increase and disperse the beneficial effect of the treatment, and the patient recovers, except that this should be done after draining the patient through phlebotomy.
Chapter LXXXVI.
Cauterizing arterial bleeding upon cutting the artery.
Arterial bleeding often occurs when a cut or injury exposes a previously unseen artery, or when a tumor or other mass is incised and cauterized, making it difficult to control the flow of blood.
If this happens to anyone, quickly place your finger over the artery's opening and apply pressure firmly so that the blood is contained under your finger and does not escape, then take several small and large hot iron tools (scalpels) and heat them over a flame until they are very hot.
Then take one of the hot iron tools, either small or large, depending on the size of the wound and the location where the artery burst, and apply it to the same vein after quickly removing your finger, gripping the tool tightly until the bleeding stops.
If, when you raise your finger away from the artery's orifice and apply the iron, it extinguishes, take another iron with haste from among those prepared in the fire, and continue to do so one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve; if there is an opening, it may cause further harm to the patient. Know that if the artery bleeds, it cannot be cut, especially if it is a large artery, unless one of four methods is used: either by burning as we have mentioned, or by amputation if it has not yet detached. If it is amputated, both ends will contract and the bleeding will stop. It can be secured with tight stitches or treated with medications that prevent blood flow and tightly wrapped with bandages.
One who attempts to stop the bleeding with bindings, or by tightening rags, or applying burning substances, etc., will not succeed in cutting it off entirely, except rarely. If someone encounters such a situation without a doctor or medicine, they should immediately place their index finger over the wound's orifice as described.
They should tightly secure it until the blood thins, flows out from above the wound and onto the artery and finger, and freezes, becoming thick and stopping. During this time, they should assess what is needed, such as burning or medication.
The Second Chapter
In incisions, abscesses, phlegmasia, and other surgical procedures.
As we mentioned in the first chapter, every disease that responds to burning with fire and hot remedies, its causes, symptoms, instruments, and images of cauterization, I have organized into chapters from the ancient to the modern era.
And I follow the same method in this chapter to facilitate the student's understanding of their requirements.
Before I begin, you should know, my children, that this chapter contains even more uncertainty than the first one on burning.
For this reason, caution should be greater, as the work in this chapter often involves significant blood loss, which is vital to life when opening a vein, treating a tumor, draining an abscess, performing surgery, or removing an arrow, among other procedures that carry uncertainty and danger, with death often being the outcome.
I warn you against falling into doubt, for in this profession, you may encounter various types of people suffering from different ailments. Some may have grown weary of their illness and be indifferent to death.
To the extreme of his pain, the length of his suffering, and the persistence of his illness, there is a sign that death is imminent. Some may even give you their wealth in the hope of regaining health, but these are people whose conditions should never be assisted.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and diligence, and do not proceed with any of these things except after certain knowledge that confirms the favorable outcome, utilizing in all treatments for your patients the advancement of knowledge and warning them of the consequences for their safety.
For in this, you will find assistance in gaining praise, glory, and gratitude. May God guide you, my children, to wisdom and divert you from error, for that is in His hands, there is no god but Him.
I have organized this chapter based on what was mentioned in the previous chapter about cauterization, from the ancient to the modern, so that it may be easier for you to understand and obtain what you desire from it, God willing.
First Chapter
On the treatment of water retention in the heads of children.
This condition often affects children at birth when the midwife applies excessive force during delivery, and it can also arise from an underlying unknown disease.
I have not seen this condition except in boys, and all of them whom I have seen, death comes to them more quickly. Therefore, I have decided to abandon this procedure. I have seen a boy whose head was filled with water and the head swells every day. Even the boy could not sit because of the swelling in his head and the increasing moisture until he died.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone or under the bone on the peritoneum. If the moisture is between the skin and bone and the tumor is small, one should make a single vertical cut through the middle of the head, about two fingers long, to allow the moisture to drain. This is an illustration of the surgical instrument.
If the moisture is excessive and the tumor greater, make two intersecting cuts as illustrated:
If the moisture is under the bone, and you observe that the seams of the head are open on all sides, and if pressing it with your hand causes the water to flow inwards, then you should make three cuts through the middle of the head as illustrated.
After the cuts, all moisture is drained, then the incisions are bound with bandages and strips. After five days, the bindings are removed, and the wound is treated with twists and ointments. The head should be held gently, and the patient fed a dry diet with minimal moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals, another method of incision is to observe where the bone of the tumor appears and the accumulation of fluid, as it may be more in the back of the head or at the front, or on the right or left side.
You intend by the incision where the tumor appears and the accumulation of fluid, so you make an incision as possible without cutting an artery to prevent bleeding that may lead to the patient's death due to this loss of blood along with the expulsion of moisture.
Chapter II.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears known as the sensitives.
When a severe attack occurs in the eyes or chest and persists despite medical treatment, the most effective cure is to cut these two arteries.
Therefore, if you wish to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to expose the artery. Next, tighten the patient's robe around their neck, look for the pulse, and locate the two depressions behind the ears, where they are most visible in most people.
Then, mark them with ink and cut them with a sharp knife all the way to the bone, making the incision across the head's width. If you prefer, insert the knife from beneath the artery and cut upwards. The length of the cut should be approximately two joined fingers.
If the pulse ceases, the blood will flow out in a pulsating manner, advancing and receding regularly. If the artery is not palpable, estimate its location from the ear, at a distance of about three fingers, then mark it with ink and make an incision towards the bone.
The blood flows in six waves or perhaps more or less, depending on the patient's condition and the fullness of their arteries. Then, examine the wound; if any part of the peritoneum remains attached to the bone, cut it away.
To prevent a hot swelling, apply a thread of cotton cloth and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter III
Treating the arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic colds or acute attacks characterized by intense moisture and heat in the temple muscles, or severe chronic headaches, and if they have undergone various medical treatments without improvement, we have found that treating the arteries in the temples (by either cutting them or cauterizing them as described) is effective for these conditions.
The procedure for treating the arteries involves shaving the hair in the temple area, focusing on the visible artery in the temple. By observing its pulse, you can determine the condition of the artery; indeed, it is rare for an individual to have a hidden or inaccessible artery.
In case of severe cold, if you do not feel the pulse, let the patient wrap himself tightly in his clothes, then rub or apply hot water to the area until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the scalpel whose image this is. Then use it to carefully peel the skin until you reach the artery, then insert a hook and pull it upwards to extract it from the skin, removing all adhesions underneath on both sides. If the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook. Then cut from it a portion according to how far its ends spread and contract, without causing bleeding. If it is not amputated or severed, the blood will not flow at all. Then drain the blood from six to three openings.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong double thread, which can be either linen or string from a bow, so that mold does not quickly affect it before the wound heals, preventing bleeding.
Then cut off the remainder between the two ties. You can do this at that moment or later, and if you wish, brand it with a skinned iron tool towards the bone, so that its ends break off, serving as a replacement for this work or even better, as we have said.
Unless the patient suffers from fever or mood disturbance, because heat is helpful in expelling humors, it becomes more beneficial. After draining the veins, the wound should be filled with old cotton and covered with tight bandages. Subsequently, it should be treated with dry medicines that nourish the flesh and twisting until healing occurs, God willing.
If, while working, bleeding occurs from an artery, cut it either with heat or by filling the wound with wax and tightening your hand until the blood stops. If nothing is at hand, place your finger in the wound to clot the blood.
If the wound is washed with very cold water to relieve pain and tightened as needed, it is lighter and easier to drain the vein by burning the sweat with this iron instrument having two blades, after marking the positions with ink.
Lower it carefully until it reaches the bone and cuts off the vein at two points to separate its ends, for it will never heal with this heat. This is a diagram of the iron.
It has two blades, resembling small shears, but the edges are much less sharp. If both are very sharp, cold water will affect them faster and the flesh will not be cut as quickly. If there is some stiffness in them, they can grip hot fire.
And cut the flesh swiftly, for this action is best of all and lightest and easiest, and let it be between the two knives as thick as a finger.
Chapter IV.
In the treatment of continuous, hot tearing into the eyes.
If the tears are continuous and the flow is from the veins on the skull outside, and no benefit is derived from medical treatment with drugs, and you see the patient's face reddened. He feels a tingling on his forehead like the sensation of ants, and his eyes are weak, moist, and his eyelashes have deteriorated due to the constant tears, causing them to stick together. The first step in treating this condition, they call 'sif' (scalpels), is to instruct the patient to shave the hair from their forehead.
Then, make three parallel incisions on the forehead, each about the length of two fingers, with one incision in the middle of the forehead parallel to the length of the nose, the second a little distance from the muscle movement in the temple, and the third on the other side.
Be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from the connection of the jawbones. After each incision, use three fingers spread apart, and have sponge pieces or dry cloths ready to absorb the blood.
Then enter the sharp scalpel with both ends, whose image this is. From the fissure next to the temple to the middle fissure, and peel off all the skin between the two fissures with the peritoneum that is on the bone, and then do the same from the middle fissure to the third fissure, and then remove this scalpel. Also, enter into the first fissure another instrument called a scalpel with one sharp end and the other smooth and not sharp, and this is its image:
It is done with the sharp side up towards the flesh attached to the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone, pushing it until it reaches the middle fissure, cutting all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do the same in the middle fissure to the other fissure. After allowing enough time for the blood to flow, compress the areas from which the clotted blood is removed, and then in each fissure place a cotton thread and cover it with a sterile dressing soaked in a mixture of wine and oil or vinegar and oil.
So that a hot swelling does not occur, and on the third day loosen the bandage and use plenty of warm compresses, then treat it with a paste of basil and rose oil and all other treatments for wounds until healing occurs, God willing.
Chapter V.
In the treatment of tears and discharges into the eyes from within the head.
When a person experiences frequent, severe, persistent episodes of discharge into the eyes, resulting in weakened vision, smaller and fragile-looking eyes, inflamed eyelids, and falling eyelashes. And there is a sharp, painful sensation in the depths of the head, accompanied by continuous sneezing, indicating that these symptoms arise from numerous deep veins. The best treatment for them involves instructing the patient to shave their forehead and then make a single cut through the middle of the forehead.
And there is a sharp, painful sensation in the depths of the head, accompanied by continuous sneezing, indicating that these symptoms arise from numerous deep veins. The best treatment for them involves instructing the patient to shave their forehead and then make a single cut through the middle of the forehead. Or, make the cut slightly higher in a transverse direction, starting from the left temple to the right temple, extending to the bone. Remove your hand away from the moving muscles of the temples during chewing, until the bone is exposed and all blood absorption has occurred using a sponge.
Separate the edges of the cut using old cotton or a strand of linen, then secure it above with bandages. Soak the bandages in the solution and oil to prevent fever swelling. If, after removing the bandages, you find that the fever swelling has subsided, gently rub the bone until new flesh grows over it.
Then, treat it with the drying procedure that promotes tissue regeneration: take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, prepare a paste from them, and apply it to the wound in such surgical procedures.
Chapter VI.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear belongs to one of four types: either a metallic stone or a semi-precious stone like iron and glass, or a plant seed such as lentil and nut, or something fluid like water, vinegar, and the like.
And if it is an animal, when a pebble or a type of pebble that does not grow large in the ear falls into the ear, and you receive the sun with your ear, then squeeze some violet fat or serum into it and try to remove it by moving your head or blowing through a cotton bud. And plug the nostrils when a sneeze comes, after placing a bandage around the ear with cloth or wool and stretching the ear upwards. Often, this treatment will expel the foreign object. If it does not come out, try to remove it gently using a soft tool like that shown here.
If the foreign body has come out by itself, try to remove it with a delicate, flexible hook. If it does not come out this way, make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole. It is good.
Seal around the tube with grease-soaked pitch to prevent air from entering other than through the tube, then pull it strongly and frequently; it will often come out this way. If it does not come out as described, take a small amount of bird glue or prepared glue that catches birds, place it at the end of the rod, and try again.
After wrapping it tightly with a cotton ball, gently insert it into the ear hole after the ear has dried. If it does not come out as described, be quick to incise before the hot swelling or spasm occurs.
The incision should be made first on the patient in the temporal bone, allowing blood to drain as much as possible. Then, place the patient between your hands and turn their ear up. Make a small incision at the base of the ear, near the mastoid process.
The incision should be in the shape of a crescent to reach and remove the stone. Then, quickly stitch the wound and treat it until healing occurs.
And if a foreign body falls into the ear from one of the grains that grow and swell, attempt to remove it as we have mentioned. If it does not yield to removal, take a delicate, thin knife as illustrated.
And try to cut that type of grain that has fallen into the ear, but only if you are certain that this grain has become softened by the steam of the ear, making it into small pieces, then remove them with a blind hook or a delicate dry cloth or by sucking.
As we have mentioned, it is easier to remove them. As for the water in the ear, the patient should first use a blow nose device or something similar while lying down on the affected ear with some old cotton, if it comes out this way.
Or, take many small, smooth stones, warm them slightly over fire, and have the patient insert one into the hole of his ear while he rests on one leg and strikes the stone in his ear with another stone.
He should continue this process with stone after stone until all water is expelled. The water can also be removed by taking a quill or feather, inserting one end into the ear, and burning the other end to create more steam, then repeating with another feather.
Do this several times until all the water is removed or draw it out with a tube, as mentioned in the case of stones. As for removing the animal that has entered it, if it is small-bodied like a tick and similar, treat it as mentioned in the classification.
If the body is large and visible, try to remove it with tweezers and hooks; this is easier than all other things that get stuck in the ear. As for removing the worms that grow inside the ear, if you treat them as mentioned in the classification in the article on parasites and your treatment does not work.
You should examine the ear in sunlight; if you notice any worms, remove them with tweezers or fine hooks. If nothing appears, take a tube, which is depicted as follows.
It is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, and insert the thin end into the ear as far as it can go comfortably, then suck strongly on it several times until all worms are removed. If they do not come out, plug the tube with wax as mentioned in the case of stones.
If nothing comes out as mentioned, use the parasites that the pioneers used to kill worms; you can find this in the article on parasites. You will apply oils and medications into the ear with this tool, and here is its image:
As you see, make them of silver or copper, with a narrow base and a small hole at the bottom, wide at the top. If you wish, the piston inside the pipe can be of tightly-forged copper. Alternatively, you might use a rod and tightly wrap a cotton ball around its end.
Then, place the fat, juice, or any other medication you desire into the tube, which is in the ear. Then, insert the rod with the cotton at the top and squeeze it gently with your hand so that the fat enters the inner ear and can be felt.
This medication should be inserted into the ear, and whatever you pour into it should be slightly warmed over fire. Be careful that what drips in is neither too cold nor too hot, as the ear cannot tolerate such extremes.
Chapter VII
On the treatment of an ear blockage.
Some children may be born with their eardrums unperforated.
Some people may also experience a blockage in the ear canal due to injury or flesh growth inside, and this blockage can be deep within the ear hole, making it invisible to the naked eye.
If the foreign body protrudes slightly from the wound and is visible, it will be difficult to remove. If it is hidden deep within the ear and cannot be seen, it will be even more challenging to extract. In all cases, the patient's affected ear should be exposed to sunlight. If, upon examination, the blockage is visible, open it gently with a delicate scalpel. This is its appearance: .
The blade should have a slightly curved tip and both sides should be smooth to avoid damaging the ear. If the blockage is caused by flesh that has grown within the ear canal, use a fine hook and cut it carefully, removing all the flesh.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, take a gentle, smooth bend, warm it slightly in fire, and then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage along with any sensation of hearing weight from the patient, carefully break off the tip.
Be careful not to injure the ear drum. Then, make a wick inside the ear that fits the size of the opening. Dip it in Egyptian ointment and apply it for several days until you are sure the wound will not stick or close. Alternatively, take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle powdered glass on it.
If you see that the ear has swelled and is hot, remove the wick and replace it with a new one soaked in rose fat to soothe the burning inflammation. Then treat it until it heals.
If there is bleeding, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use all other treatments to stop the mentioned bleeding as described in the article on catheters.
Chapter VIII.
In the treatment of warts appearing on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry, so they should be grabbed with a tweezers or a hook and cut off at the root with a scalpel, then the affected area should be treated with powdered glass.
If blood bleeds, remove them with a gentle lentil-shaped iron, and applying heat afterward is better after cutting; however, they often return if any roots remain. If the roots are burned with fire, they will not grow back.
Chapter IX.
In the treatment of cold in the eyelids.
It often exposes something that resembles cold in its intensity and hardness on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called "al-برد" (the cold), which is the accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The procedure involves observation: if the cold is prominent on the outer surface of the eyelid, it moves in all directions, then it is easy to make a horizontal cut through it.
Then, peel it gently from all sides until you are free, then hang it on a hook and cut it. If cutting it is not possible without completely severing the eyelid, this will not harm the patient. If the cut is large, sew it together and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, there is no need to worry, as the ointment will heal and seal it. If the cold tends towards the inner surface of the eyelid, turn the lid upside down and hang the cold on a hook without the need for cutting, then cut it from all sides.
If cutting through the eyelid is necessary, this will not harm the patient. Then, wash the eye after removing the cold with salty water and treat the area to promote healing until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of a fissure that appears in the eyelid.
The conjunctiva is a membrane that lies in the upper eyelid, most commonly affecting children. It weighs on their eyes and causes them to have discharge at night, preventing them from seeing sunlight. This causes tears to flow more quickly towards them.
Therefore, they are often seen resting their faces and sleeping with their eyelids under the eyebrows moistened by discharge, and the conjunctiva appears clearly visible. When you press on the area with your fingers, you can feel the conjunctiva between them. The treatment involves placing the patient's head in your lap.
Then, take a cotton cloth, prepare a thread from it, and make a circle with that thread around the conjunctiva from all sides. Place it on top of the conjunctiva and press gently with your fingers from all sides to gather the conjunctiva in the center of the circle.
Then, using a sharp scalpel, make a vertical cut in the center of this discharge, not larger than the cut made during phlebotomy. In depth, you should cut through all the skin layers until you reach the conjunctiva.
In most cases, the conjunctiva protrudes from the cut as a white piece of fat. Using a cloth that you have wrapped between your fingers, gently pull it out and rotate your hand to the right and left until it comes free. Be careful not to increase the depth of the cut or the scalpel may enter the eye, causing damage.
If the snare does not appear at the beginning of the incision, it is necessary to slightly increase the depth of the incision gently until the snare becomes visible, then pull it as we have said. Then dip a piece of cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the wound, securing it with a bandage, and some people crush salt onto it.
He places it inside the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture, then treats it until it heals. If a hot lump forms at the site, treat it with soothing remedies until it heals.
Chapter 11.
On various forms of eye compression.
If growths develop on the eyelid, forming additional lashes that grow in a different direction from the natural lashes and become persistent, they can harm the eye and cause various conditions such as constant tearing, drooping eyelids, white spots, and thickness, potentially leading to vision impairment.
Eye compression can be performed in four ways: either by burning with fire, or using sharp medications as mentioned in the chapter on burning, or by cutting and stitching, or by using reed (or similar material) as I have previously stated.
You should position the patient's head in your lap and, with your left hand, flip the eyelid. If it flips, otherwise, insert an needle with a thread underneath the eyelid, passing the needle through the thread from above, close to the hair itself, and pull the thread upwards towards the eyelid.
Turn it with the retractor, then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid, avoiding the surplus hair, using a scalpel from the outer corner to the inner corner of the eye. Then pass the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid. Finally, mark on the eyelid with ink.
It should resemble the shape of an oak leaf, but the shape should be adjusted to achieve the desired lifting of the eyelid, as people may differ in this regard; some may require cutting a suitable amount from the eyelid depending on how loose it is.
Some may require less cutting, adjusted to the looseness of the eyelid; then, using the scalpel, make incisions along the marked lines, starting from the outer corner to the inner corner of the eye, with each cut close to the natural hairline, approximately the width of the retractor.
Then, insert the forceps into one corner of the skin and peel it entirely; then, sew the edges together with a needle and thin woolen thread, clean the blood, and attach any remaining threads to the eyebrows using sticky substances.
You may choose to do so or not, but either way, the stitches and threads will remain for about three or four days, then you can treat it; alternatively, you can leave the wound unstitcher and treat it with drying and constricting agents, as closing the wound and stitching it together is preferable.
This aspect of tightness is mentioned by the ancients, but it provides relief to the patient and is one of the good practices with no risk involved. There is another aspect in the tightening as well, which is to shape the eyelid like the form of a date palm leaf, as we have described. Then the eyelid is raised with three pins, either spread apart or grouped together, in this manner:
Then cut off the remaining part of the eyelid with a small scissors, cutting it evenly as follows:
If you cannot hold the pins, or it is not suitable for you, take a needle with thread and insert it into the center of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger eyelid and a third thread near the smaller eyelid. Then, gently gather the threads between your fingers and raise your hand moderately with them.
Lift the entire marked skin as we have described, then sew together the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. If a hot lump appears when you cut or incise, soothe it with cauterization and similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also experience a condition where its lashes turn inward. In this case, the procedures mentioned, including cutting, stitching, and tightening with fire or sharp drugs, are more effective and less harmful to the patient than complete removal and stitching.
The incision with the reed should be made as follows: turn the eyelid inside out and make a cut as described, then create two thin reeds or wooden splints whose length corresponds to that of the eyelid and whose width is less than that of the scalpel.
They should be cut on both sides near the ends where the stitches are attached, then gently brought together and secured over the remaining part of the eyelid. Leave them for several days; the stretched skin will die and turn black and putrid.
Until it falls by itself, if it does not, use a chisel to remove it and treat the wound until it heals. If it adheres, the eyelid will raise without any harm to the eye's margins. Here is a picture of the reeds made in this shape and size:
Chapter Twelve.
Raising the dislodged eyelash with a needle.
If it is a single hair or two, the procedure is as follows: take a fine needle and insert a thin, smooth silk thread into it. Then gather both ends and tie them together with a very small knot. The length of the thread should be approximately one span (about 10 cm).
Then, attach a finer thread to the bandage, slightly shorter than the previous one, and tie both ends. Place the patient's head on your lap, close to the sun for better visibility, as this is a delicate procedure. Then, insert the needle with the thread into the base of the stray hair.
Perform this procedure on the eyelid with haste to extricate it above the natural hair, then pull the thread over the bandage and insert it into that bandage, whether one, two, or three hairs at most.
Then, with your hand, you pull on it until the hair comes out with the bandage in the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pulled the bandage but the hair did not come out with it, pull the bandage down using the thread that was inserted into it, so it comes out from the upper hole.
Then, you put the hair back in and pull it until it rises in the upper hole, making it clearly visible. At that point, release the bandage and thread, remove them, and apply pressure to the eye for two or three days until the hair takes its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add a longer natural hair to it so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after some time, then raise it.
Chapter XIII.
In the treatment of the aperture (or wound) that occurs on the upper eyelid of the eye.
The condition described, where the aperture (or wound) forms on the upper eyelid, is called "arnabiya" (or rabbit-like). This aperture can be either natural or acquired through conditions such as healing of a scar, laceration, incision, or any other similar cause.
In this procedure, the task is to incise the hematoma, divide its edges, and insert a thread of linen between them, securing it until healing occurs. It is not advisable to use drying or constricting agents in its treatment.
If, however, you do this, the hematoma will return worse than before, and you should use agents that relax it, such as fennel or anusmith (a preparation) in water with crushed chamomile and flaxseed, mixed with a quantity of fat, and apply it to the thread.
The essence of its treatment is to strive by every means to prevent it from returning to its original state, and the procedure we mentioned is merely a form of repairing the hematoma, not reversing the site's condition as it was before.
Chapter XIV
In the treatment of hematomas on the lower eyelid.
This hematoma, which occurs on the lower part (of the body), is what is truly called a "stra" (hematoma). It is natural and occurs incidentally; the incidental one results from a wound, cut, burn, or similar event.
The procedure involves taking an needle with a doubled thread and sewing it into the flesh, passing it from the left corner of the eye to the right, so that the thread passes through both sides of the flesh. Then, using the needle, you lift the flesh above and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what is appropriate, otherwise take a knife and place it on the site of the incision and flip the eyelid with it, making two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the incisions will be from the angles of the cut that was made until they meet, forming an angle. Until they meet, it will have the shape as shown here.
It is the Greek letter lambda, then you remove that flesh as much as the sharp side of it is below what lies against the eyelid, then gather the scattered parts with two stitches, stitching it with a woolen thread, and treat it with the soothing drugs and twists as we mentioned until it heals.
If the injury was from a cut, stitching, or burning, then one should make a simple incision without affecting the hairs of the lid, and then separate the lips with twists as mentioned before.
In conclusion, when treating an injury from above or below, the treatment should be tailored to the specific condition of the wound, as it may vary greatly in appearance. The surgeon must use their discretion and devise a solution using any means available.
Until the shape returns to its natural state or approximates it, the same principles apply for determining suitable treatment and tools in most cases.
Chapter XV.
In the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may prevent many people from moving their eye lid freely and impede its natural functions, so a thin strip should be inserted under the eyelid.
Then raise it above or extend it with a hook, and then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel that is not as sharp as ordinary scalpels, but rather blunt, so as not to disturb the patient during the procedure, preventing the scalpel from slipping and causing harm to the eye with its sharpness. The cut should be made as if you were peeling off the adhesion.
And when the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed, then pour salt water into the eye to clean it or apply a drop of ginger-based solution, followed by separating the lid from the eye with a cotton string.
Place a wet woolen pad over the eye and, after three days, use compresses soaked in honey until it heals.
Chapter XVI.
In cutting the tendon and stitching the flesh of the wound.
The tendon is of two kinds: either nerve-bound, resembling a thin, rigid membrane; or non-nerve-bound, resembling a hard, white consistency that breaks when touched with iron or caught with a hook.
And if a hook does not adhere to it, both types begin from the larger orifice and gradually increase in depth until they obscure vision and prevent light and eye movement. The method of cutting them involves the patient lying on their back on your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, you raise the eyelid with your hand, grab the tendon with a slightly flexible hook, and pull it up. Then take a needle and insert a horse or cattle hair and a strong thread into it, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and pierce it through the middle of the tendon.
You push the needle through and tie the tendon with the thread, pulling it up, and then peel away the tendon from the iris with the hair as if spreading it with the hair until the end. Then cut the remaining part at the base of the orifice using a delicate scalpel or a small scissors, leaving the natural eye meat.
To prevent the constant flow of tears, the tendon can be pulled with a hook alone or with thread as mentioned, then peeled using a smooth-ended scalpel, as illustrated below.
Be cautious that the surgical knife does not touch the corneal membrane, causing a rupture and widening of the pupil. After making the cut, apply some powdered salt or zingari (a type of ointment) to the eye and leave it until the following day, then treat it as necessary until healing occurs.
If the eyelid is non-nervous and neither an needle nor a hook can be inserted into it, this type of eyelid often heals on its own with medication as described in the preceding sections. If you decide to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a delicate, smooth scalpel as shown in the figure. Carefully remove the eyelid from above with a gentle, smooth motion. If it appears loose, brittle, and separated only due to this motion, apply some zingari (a type of ointment) or red salve or powdered salt to the eye and leave it until the following day.
Then, continue the process until all of it is removed, unless a hot, swollen tumor appears in the eye, in which case leave it and treat the hot tumor until it heals, then resume the process of carefully removing the eyelid until healing occurs.
If the fold of skin (نتو) is causing severe harm to the eye, attach it with a hook and cut off some of it, but do not excessively cut to prevent excessive tearing. Then, apply red salve or zingari to the eyes until healing occurs.
Chapter XVII.
In the removal of the eye's redundant flesh and growths.
In some people, a red flesh may grow in the eyes, overlapping or almost covering the pupil, and sometimes overflowing onto the eyelids, which can turn inside out and resemble a mandrake flower.
The procedure involves the patient lying on their headrest while you open their eyes and use appropriate pincers to remove all of the red flesh.
You should hold it with a scalpel or forceps, cutting away the flesh in layers from the outside in until it is all removed, taking care to preserve the eye during the process. You can use either a scalpel described for cutting the nail or small scissors. as illustrated in the following figure.
After removing all the flesh, fill the eye with crushed salt or drop in some red soot (or other astringent medications) and then apply a clean cotton ball soaked in egg white from the outside to prevent excessive swelling.
If there remains something from the bleeding and the blood overcomes you, and you fear a hot tumor, then leave the eye and treat it with what calms the tumor, then continue with the operation until it heals, and do the same with any excess tissue that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating every weak eye with natural remedies or surgical intervention with iron, and do not put your hand into any of these treatments until you see that the organ is suitable for that treatment.
Chapter XVIII
On the treatment of eye problems.
The condition is red veins that are woven over the eye, obstructing vision and weakening it with the passage of time. You should first examine it: if the eye with the veins is strong and has no other illness besides the veins, then...
The treatment is as follows: instruct the patient to lay their head on your lap, then use a hook (or two, depending on your skill) to gently attach these veins. The hooks should be flexible and bent in this manner:...
or two hooks in a single body, as shown here:...
Then, using a delicate scissors, carefully snip the vessels and wipe away the blood from time to time until the eye perceives that the vessels have disappeared and the blood has drained. Be cautious with the eye, do not hurt it with the scissors' tips, and let your work be done in the afternoon facing the sun.
And be very careful in your work so as not to cut any vessels other than the ones you intend to, and if you finish, use a green or red eye dropper to consume what remains of the substance with its sharpness; if you cannot remove all of it at that time, dress the eye with something to alleviate the pain.
Leave it for several days until the pain subsides and the swelling disappears, then continue with the treatment in the same manner until the eye heals completely.
Leave it [with the sick head resting on the student's lap, while another dries the tear ducts and checks the vision in the front and back of the eye, and you] are the main focus of the work to open the eye with fixed or triangular openings held by a student.
Cut carefully with the instrument, keeping the sick head resting on the student's lap, while another dries the tear ducts and checks the vision in the front and back of the eye. You have the option to begin cutting from either above or below the eye; it is better to dry two channels on the upper side, one at the end of the eyelid and the other at its beginning.
Grip it between the thumb and index finger, then attach pincers underneath. Hold it again between the ring and little fingers, and gently lift your hand to see if the tendon has risen. Cut from the smaller end with scissors or a delicate scalpel.
The surgeon inserts the needle through the tendon, piercing it completely so that it rises above the flesh. Do not cut the tendon, as the blood and moisture will spread upon you.
Then, cut with scissors what exceeds the tendon both above and below, so that nothing remains attached except for the bone. If you can lift it from the bone using the surgeon's tool, do so, as this is the best method. In some cases, it may come off easily.
If the cutting causes any pain or swelling, it should be left alone for a few days until the discomfort subsides, and then the procedure can be resumed.
Chapter XIX
In repairing the nose.
The physicians call this condition 'nasorrhoea'. If it does not heal with cauterization or sharp, burning medicines as described previously, the only remedy is to puncture the abscess when it has ripened and drain out all the moisture or pus within.
Until the bone is exposed, if it is revealed and you see corruption or blackness in it, remove it with this instrument, which is shaped like this:
The instrument called "al-khashnah al-ras" is made of Indian iron, and its head is rounded like a seed. It has a fine engraving, similar to that of a knife or a scalpel, which you place on the affected area of the bone. Then, you rotate it between your fingers while slightly tightening your hand until the corruption or blackness is completely removed.
You repeat this process several times, then apply drying and contracting medications to the wound. If it heals, new flesh grows, the flow of blood stops, and no further issues arise for forty days, the treatment is considered successful.
Know that it has healed. If not, there is no other remedy but to push the fistula back into the nostril, revealing the bone again with iron or a sharp medication. Once the bone is exposed, take a forceps shaped like this:
The end of the iron should be triangular, and its handle should be a cone-shaped protrusion, as you can see. Then place it on the bone itself, close to the nose and slightly away from the eye, and rotate your hand with the forceps until the bone is extracted and the patient feels it.
By having the patient hold their hand over their nose and feeling the air escaping, you can determine if the fistula is open. Then, apply drying and contracting medications as previously instructed. If the flesh grows back and hardens in place, the discharge that was previously coming out will return to the nostril, which will be lighter on the patient, God willing.
Chapter XX.
In the repair of the eye's net (or mesh).
If the eye's net (or mesh) is entirely detached, without causing any harm or loss of sight, it should be carefully loosened, then sutured in place, and finally a small needle should be inserted on the back of the eye without any specific condition.
Then, place on the eye a poultice made of poplar, fenugreek, frankincense, and myrrh, and secure it with many bandages. The method for preparing the bandages is to take soft lint, fold each piece into four parts, and thus create many of them.
Then, place them one upon the other, as much as the eye requires, and secure it with a strong cloth, reinserting the needle for suction without any condition, then remove the needle and leave the eye bound for a day and night.
If the bandage relaxes during this time, it should be tightened, and then, after a day and night as we said, if you find that the eye has returned to its place, otherwise, repeat the dressing, bandages, tightening, and suction until it returns.
Chapter XXI.
In Amputating the Grape (or Strawberry) Fistula.
If a fistula appears in the grape (or strawberry) layer, and then becomes gangrenous and protrudes outside the skin like a strawberry, distorting the human form, and you wish to amputate it, proceed as I describe.
Insert a needle from the base of the strawberry upwards, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the opening and pull it through, leaving the first needle in place.
Then, cut the bend of the doubled thread and tie a portion of the strawberry around the needle, pulling it tightly. Remove the needle and place a wet plaster of egg white over the wound, leaving it until the threads and strawberry detach. Then treat the eye with remedies to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals, tighten the strawberry from all sides with a circle of cloth to promote eye growth. Then, use a thin scalpel to access the depth of the eye, allowing egg white fluid to drain and the eye to descend and wilt slightly, before securing it until healed.
Chapter Twenty-Second.
On Treating Hemorrhoids.
This condition, known as the "coma," is merely a period in which the eye accumulates fluid resembling descending water but without it. The method of treatment involves having the patient sit on an upright chair and then holding their head with both hands from the sides.
You should move the head until you observe the period descending in your eye, then it stabilizes and does not disappear, and light is released, allowing the patient to see objects as they normally would. If the descent of the period does not occur as described, we know that it is not water; if it does not prepare for the descent as mentioned.
Otherwise, have the patient sit between your hands and then take a thin scalpel and make a slight cut above the cornea membrane where it connects to the sclera at the limbus, allowing the material to exit.
If it exits, pour warm water in the eye, mixed with honey or water boiled with fennel and honey, and then treat with all other remedies until healing occurs.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
As we mentioned the types of water in division and which one is suitable for the cup with detailed, explanatory speech, take it from there for health. Then, you should have the patient sit between your hands, squatting facing the light near the sun.
Secure and fasten the healthy eye, then raise the eyelid with your left hand if it is the water eye (left eye), or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the tip of the cautery near the edge of the cornea, with a thick rod resting on the white part of the eye, from the side of the smaller pupil, and push the cautery firmly while rotating it in your hand until it penetrates the white part of the eye, and you feel the cautery reach something hollow.
The depth to which the cautery goes should be proportional to the distance from the pupil to the edge of the cornea (the limbus), for copper will appear in the observer's field of vision due to the clarity of the cornea, and then the cautery should move upwards to the position where the water is.
Then press it down repeatedly; if the water begins to drain, the patient will see what their vision has revealed, and the cautery should remain in their eye. Then pause slightly. If the water rises again, lower it a second time without removing the cautery.
If it stabilizes and does not rise again, carefully remove the cautery while twisting your hand slightly, then dissolve a small amount of fine salt in water and wash the inside of the eye with it. Finally, apply a moist bandage or cloth over the entire eye.
Moisturize the eye with rose oil and white of egg, and bind it with a healthy eye. As for us and people of our time, we apply crushed cumin mixed with white of egg. If the speculum does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have eyes that are very hard. One should take the speculum, called the 'bureid', whose image is shown here.
Punch only through the membranous tissue with this instrument, without excessively drilling. Gently tap the speculum into place and then insert it as mentioned. Upon completing the procedure, prepare the patient to rest securely on their back in a dark room.
Avoid all movements, coughing, and ensure the patient's diet softens their condition. Do not move their head to the right or left at all. Keep the bandage in place until the third day, then remove it in that dark room and test their sight.
Show them objects and then replace the bandage until the seventh day. You should not do this during treatment or after using your instrument, but rather avoid it until before the water rises quickly with intense looking.
If a hot tumor appears, remove the bandage before the seventh day and treat it with something that soothes the tumor until it subsides. Once it has subsided, release the patient's sight and place a veil over their face for several days within that dark room to help them readjust their vision.
The surgeon progresses gradually from the house and deals with its causes. Know that in this art, the learner cannot do without observing repeatedly; then he can proceed to act. I have been told by some Iraqis that he mentioned making a drain in Iraq that sucks water out.
I have never seen anyone in our country make it, nor have I read about it in any of the first books, and this might be a recent development. Here is an image depicting various types of drains for those unfamiliar with them.
They are made particularly of copper, with an end that is just as delicate, triangular in shape and sharp.
Chapter XXIV.
In the treatment of flesh growths in the nose.
Various types of flesh growths can develop in the nose, some resembling legged scorpions, others being cancerous and hardened like a black mass, while some are soft and not discolored.
For the soft flesh that is neither malignant nor cancerous, the patient should sit facing the sun with their nose open, and you should insert a hook into these growths, then pull it out and cut what has been reached using a delicate, sharp scalpel on one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone, if anything remains, you will not be able to cut it, so remove it with one of the delicate instruments gently until nothing is left. If the blood overpowers or a hot tumor appears.
If it is confronted with what is appropriate or it was a malignant tumor, then hurry to cut it off until the blood stops and all the flesh is gone, then pour into the nose afterward a vacuum or a drink, for if the nose opens and moisture flows from it to the throat.
Know that it has healed, if moisture does not flow as it should, know that there is flesh inside the bones that the cutting tool did not reach, in that case, you should take a thread of linen slightly thick.
And tie many knots in it, making each knot slightly thicker than a finger or less, and the patient inserts one end of the thread into his nose with a rod or what he can make, similar to a plug, and pulls it until it reaches the nostrils.
It comes out in a loop, and often young boys in schools do this, which is easy for anyone who wants to, then you gather the two ends of the thread, one that came out of the mouth and the other left in the nose.
Then you use the instrument to spread the flesh tied with the knots in the thread, doing this until you know that the flesh is cut by the knots in the thread, then remove the thread and clean the nose after wiping away the blood with a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment, do this for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh, then it becomes the last thing in the nose a lead pipe for some days until it heals, if it needs treatment, dryness is used for it.
And this is an image of the dropper that releases oils and medicines into the nose:
He places a small, open jellyfish-like applicator of silver or copper, with its channel also open.
And if you prefer, make the pipe closed like a tube and the applicator's grease flat.
It has a handle at the end, as you can see, to hold it if you heat up the grease or any other extracts or flowing substances.
Chapter Twenty-Fifth.
On the warts growing at the tip of the nose.
A wart often grows at the tip of the nose, increasing in size and becoming more disfiguring over time.
Therefore, it should be cut off as soon as it appears and all of it removed. Then, apply either cauterization or a burning medicine that acts like cauterization to the site. If it is impossible to cut it off before it grows large, examine it; if it has become hard and colorless with little sensation, then proceed accordingly.
Do not attempt to treat it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor, and I have often seen great harm result from cutting into such a tumor. Even if the tumor feels soft and is not discolored, I believe that incision is still possible throughout its entirety. Then induce the patient to vomit and cut without caution or delay, and treat the wound with astringents and tonics until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In stitching the nose, lip, and ear. If the connection breaks away from a wound or similar injury, know that once any of these cartilages' connections break, little to no effective treatment can be done for it in most cases, except perhaps for certain individuals.
If one of these conditions arises, you should first see if the wound is still fresh and filled with blood. Then sew the edges together and treat it until it heals. If the connection has broken apart, leaving two distinct parts, you should carefully scrape each part to make it bleed, ensuring a stronger healing process.
Then sew the edges together, tighten them, and apply a mixture of myrrh and frankincense powder on top. Place a seal made from a paste of nettle ointment or another sealing balm over it. Leave it for two to three days before undoing the stitches.
Changing the dressing and leaving it until the stitches dissolve on their own, then treating it with a salve until healing occurs. The method of suturing involves bringing together what is separated either with needles as we described in the suture of the abdomen, or with thread as we mentioned there.
Chapter XXVII.
In removing knots that appear on the lips.
Many people may present you with small, hard tumors inside their lips that resemble sesame seeds or are smaller or larger, in which case you should turn the lip inside out, make a cut on each knot, and remove it with a hook.
Cut them off from all sides, then fill the incision site with powdered ash until the bleeding stops, and rinse with vinegar and salt. Treat the areas with constrictive agents until the wounds heal.
Chapter XXVIII.
On cutting excess flesh from the gums.
Excess flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients call "abulus." You should remove it with a hook or scrape it off at the base and allow the blood to flow, then apply powdered ash to the site.
If a dry and contractile cartilage returns to its original state after treatment, it often re-forms. In this case, cut it off again and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
In the inventory of teeth with iron.
Coarse, unpleasant scales may gather on the inner and outer surfaces of the teeth and between the gums. They may become discolored, turning black, yellow, or green, leading to gum inflammation and tooth deformity.
You should have the patient sit between your hands and head on your lap, then extract the tooth with scales or anything resembling sand, ensuring nothing remains. You should also do this for any blackness, greenness, yellowness, or other discoloration until it is purified.
If the scales do not disappear from the first inventory, repeat the process on a different day, and then again and again until you achieve your goal. Keep in mind that each tooth may require different techniques and shapes according to what is suitable for your work.
The instrument used to clean a tooth from the inside is different from that used for external cleaning and between the teeth. There are several types of instruments, each with its specific shape, that you should have ready.
Chapter Thirty
In the extraction of teeth.
One should treat the toothache with every means and not hesitate to extract it, for it is a noble substance, even if there is no other option but to remove it.
If the patient is determined to extract it, then it should be secured until the aching tooth heals. Often, the patient in pain is deceived and thinks that it is a healthy tooth, so they extract it, but the pain does not disappear until the diseased tooth is removed; we have witnessed this many times by the actions of barbers.
If the aching tooth is correctly identified, one should then use a scalpel with some force to loosen the gum from all sides, and subsequently move it slightly with their fingers or gentle pliers until it becomes loose.
Then, firmly grasp the tooth with both pincers, placing the patient's head between your knees for stability, and pull it straight without breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of the instruments, insert it under the tooth on all sides, and move it as you initially did.
If a tooth is hollow or decayed, it should be filled with a cloth and properly sealed with a thin rod to prevent its rupture during the application of forceps and clamps. The condition around the gums should be thoroughly examined on all sides.
Beware of your efforts, lest you break it and some remains, causing greater harm to the patient than their initial pain. Do not do what the ignorant surgeons do by cutting off parts without using the described methods.
Often, they inflict great harm on people; the least of which is that a tooth may break and its roots remain intact or partially so. Either the tooth is extracted along with some jawbone, as we have seen many times, then rinse it with a drink or vinegar and salt; if there is bleeding from the site, which often happens, then crush some glass and fill the cavity.
If the glass does not help, use a fine forceps with a long shaft and a short handle, thick enough not to bend when you grip the tooth; this is the image of the small forceps. Here is the image of the large forceps:
The handles should be thick, as you see, so that when you grip them, they do not slip or bend; they should be short in length. They can be made of Indian iron or steel, with the ends rounded and fitted together tightly to ensure a secure grip.
And the limbs may be made to resemble shears, thus providing a strong grasp.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the extraction of root tips and the removal of broken jawbone fragments.
If, when extracting a tooth, the root tip has broken off and remains in place, one should apply a piece of fat soaked cloth to the area for one or two days to soften it, then insert forceps or pliers. which resemble the sides of a bird's beak, known as a billage, and an image of the pliers follows:
If it does not exit with these pliers, one should dig into the root and expose all the tissue with a scalpel, then insert a small lever-like instrument, as illustrated below:
Short-handled and slightly thick, not too sharp to avoid breakage. If the root comes out with this, otherwise use these other instruments as illustrated, the first with a triangular tip that has some thickness.
Another delicate triangular shape:
And we may also avail ourselves of this machine with two nozzles, the picture of which is here shown:
And other instruments and sharp objects previously mentioned in the inventory of teeth, and we may also avail ourselves of this instrument similar to a large plier, the picture of which is here shown:
Triangular in shape with a slight bend, where some thickness is required to prevent breakage, and it should be unstained. Know that there are many instruments for teeth, as well as other tools, which cannot be counted, and a skilled craftsman can invent machines for himself according to the requirements of work and diseases themselves.
For there are diseases for which the first ones did not mention instruments due to the diversity of their types, if a bone from the jaw or from one of the bones of the mouth breaks or decays, inspect it in its place with one of these tools and pliers mentioned for extracting roots.
And we use this pair, the picture of which is here shown:
It has a slight thickness to hold the bone so that it does not slip until the bone is removed, and we treat the site with appropriate drugs, if the bone is slightly rotten, remove the rot and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
The Thirty-Second Chapter.
In the removal of teeth that have grown crookedly among others.
If teeth grow crookedly deviating from their natural alignment, it distorts the beauty, especially in women and slaves. One should carefully examine if a tooth has grown behind another.
If it cannot be straightened or moved, and it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument, whose shape is as follows:
It resembles a small beak, and it should be made of sharp, high-quality iron. Use it over several days to cut the tooth firmly, avoiding damaging nearby teeth. If the tooth is easily movable, cool it with a cold tool from India, whose shape is as follows:
It should be entirely made of India, with a very finely engraved handle, similar to the tool used for making needles. Cool the tooth gently over several days using this tool; do not rush, lest you damage surrounding teeth. Then smooth it and file it away with other tools.
If a tooth has broken, causing pain to the tongue when speaking, it should also be cooled until the roughness of the break goes away, becoming smooth and not hurting the tongue or impairing speech.
Chapter XXXIII.
In the interweaving of mobile teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the anterior teeth become unsteady and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient is unable to chew anything edible without risking further loss, having tried without success various astringent remedies.
The solution is to tighten a gold or silver thread, with gold being preferable as silver tarnishes and corrodes over time, while gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of medium softness and firmness, suitable for the space between the teeth.
The technique involves taking the thread and inserting its bend between the healthy teeth, then weaving both ends of the thread between the mobile teeth, one or more, until the weave reaches the healthy tooth on the other side.
Then, reweaving from the starting point, gently but firmly tighten your grip on the thread to ensure it does not move, tightening at the roots of the teeth to prevent slippage. Cut off any excess thread with scissors, gather and twist the ends together using a twine, and hide them between the healthy and mobile teeth.
To prevent damage to the tongue, it should then be left in this position, taut, for as long as it remains intact. If it becomes loose or detached, tighten it with another thread so that it may function properly for all time. This is an illustration of teeth and their intermeshing in two healthy teeth and two mobile teeth, as you can see:
A tooth or both teeth may sometimes return to their original position after falling out and intermesh as described, remaining in place. This is only possible with the skill of a skillful dentist, who may also carve a bone from a cow to create a tooth-like structure and insert it into the gap left by the missing tooth. It is tightened as we have said, remaining stable and functioning properly.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
In cutting the ligament exposed under the tongue, it prevents speech.
This ligament exposed under the tongue may either be a natural feature present since birth or a result of a wound that has healed.
The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth and placing their head in your lap, then raising their tongue and cutting the nerve ligament running across it horizontally until the tongue is released from its attachment. If there is some stiffness or complexity due to scar tissue from a previous wound, you may use a hook to pry it open and slice through the ligament vertically to completely release it.
Be cautious that the incision does not go too deep into the flesh, as it may cut a vessel and cause bleeding. After making the cut, rinse with rosewater or vinegar mixed with cold water. Then, place under the tongue a piece of cotton which the patient holds each night.
If it bleeds again, apply powdered glass to the wound. If blood persists, use a lens-shaped iron to suck out the blood. Then treat it with all other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the removal of the toad formed under the tongue.
A tumor may develop under the tongue, resembling a small toad, preventing the tongue from its natural movements and possibly even swelling to fill the mouth. The treatment involves opening the patient's mouth towards the sun and examining the tumor.
If you see it as a black, hard lump that the patient cannot feel, do not interfere, for it is cancer. However, if it leans towards white and has moisture, insert a hook in it and cut it with a delicate knife from all sides to remove it.
If blood prevails while you are working, apply powdered glass until the blood stops, then resume your work to remove it completely. Afterwards, rinse your mouth with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with all appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter XXXVI.
On the treatment of tonsillar swelling.
And any growth in the throat, other than tonsil stones, that resembles tonsils within the throat, if it does not heal after being treated as mentioned in the sections, is called enlarged tonsils.
Examine it: if the tumor is solid, dark in color and not sensitive, do not treat it with iron. If it is red in color and its origin is thick, do not also treat it with iron to avoid bleeding. Leave it until it ripens; either it will subside on its own or it will burst from within.
If it is white in color, round, and its origin is thin, this is what should be cut. The action consists of examining it before treatment to see if the hot tumor has completely subsided or has decreased in size.
When ready, seat the patient facing the sun with their head in your lap. Open their mouth and place a servant between your hands, who will press the tongue downward using this instrument: [image or description follows]
The instrument should be made of silver or copper, thin as a knife. When pressing the tongue and observing the swelling, use a hook and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it outward as much as possible without disturbing the surrounding tissue.
Then, cut it with this instrument, which resembles scissors but has both ends bent towards each other, extremely sharp. It is made of Indian iron or Damascus steel: [image or description follows]
If this instrument is not available, cut it with a scalpel: [image or description follows]
Sharp on one side and dull on the other, after cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner. Then, rinse the patient's mouth with cold water or a mixture of vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, rinse with boiling water mixed with pomegranate peel or assafoetida (or similar astringents) until the bleeding stops. Then treat as mentioned for tonsil issues. Similarly, any other growths in the throat, such as additional tumors, can be cut out using the same method described for tonsils.
A woman was treated for a tumour that had grown inside her throat, extending to the tonsil, which was only slightly sensitive and almost blocked the throat. The woman's breathing was restricted, and she was unable to eat or drink.
And if she had remained for one or two days, she would have died. The tumour had sent out two branches that emerged from her nostrils, so she acted quickly and inserted a hook into one of them, then pulled it out, and a good piece came off.
She cut it off at the point where she reached it from the nostril, then did the same for the other nostril, opened her mouth, pressed her tongue down, and inserted the hook into the tumour again, cutting off some of it, leaving only a little blood.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water and eat food. For a long time, they continued to cut off the tumour, which kept regenerating until it affected both of them.
I tried and cauterized the tumour inside the throat, which prevented its growth. Then I left the region, not knowing what God had done with her after me.
Chapter Seven and Thirty.
In the removal of the tonsil tumour.
If a tumour, called an "abouta" (grape), descends to the tonsil and swells, becoming white, elongated, and rectangular, it is called a "column." If it is thicker at the bottom and round, it is called a "grapes," if treated as described in the classification, but without effect.
You should cut off the hot tumour if it has subsided and is thin, but avoid cutting off any that are rounded, compact, of a purplish or black color, or without sensation.
If you observe these characteristics—whiteness and elongation—you should have the patient sit facing the sun, press his tongue with the instrument described earlier, then insert the hook into the "grapes.
Pull it down and cut it with one of the instruments mentioned for removing the tonsil, but only remove what exceeds the natural amount; otherwise, you will harm the voice and speech.
After cutting, use the same method described for removing the tonsil and treat it until healing occurs. If the patient refuses to have it cut, apply heat using a sharp remedy by placing his head in your lap.
Then compress his tongue with the instrument mentioned, and take some sharp water as mentioned in the chapter on burning, and mix it with non-extinguish clay until it is neither thick nor thin, and fill the hollows of this instrument with it. This is its shape: .
The end of the instrument that holds the medicine has a hollow shape like a spoon, and you place the medicated instrument on the uvula while the patient lies on their side, allowing saliva to flow from their mouth into their throat without any foreign objects entering and causing harm.
Then grip the medicine with your hand and squeeze it onto the uvula for half an hour until it turns black and the sting of the medicine subsides. If you wish, take a cotton swab, wrap it around the end of the rod, dip it in the medicine, and apply it.
Insert the rod with the cotton swab into the tube from above, sticking the cotton onto the uvula. Repeat this process as many times as needed to achieve the desired burning effect on the grape. Leave it, and after three or four days, it will wilt and fall off. If required, reapply the medicine.
After the burning, wipe around the grape with a cotton swab soaked in butter and dry the surrounding area of medicine. Then rinse with cold water and apply external treatments with compresses and internal gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further away from fear.
Treating the throat may also be done more gently than with burning or cutting, using herbs such as fennel, za'far (saffron), thyme, dolichos, chamomile, and mugwort, either individually or in combinations, boiled in vinegar.
The pot is sealed with clay and placed over a fire, with a hole in the lid through which the hollow instrument is inserted. It is made of silver or brass.
The end of the instrument, containing the apple, is inserted into the patient's mouth, allowing the vapor to reach the throat. This process should be repeated several times until the throat is soothed and relaxed. Avoid using this treatment in the early stages of a tumor.
If the swelling increases, it is a sign of the heat in the tumor, and you should only proceed when the tumor has subsided. If you do not have the hollow instrument, take a tube and attach a slice of egg shell to its end to avoid burning the patient's mouth.
Because the egg shell prevents the hot vapor from burning the mouth, this is a good treatment for its safety and effectiveness.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
In the removal of thorns and anything lodged in the throat other than that.
Often, a bone, fishbone, or other foreign object becomes lodged in the throat. One should remove whatever is visible after pressing the tongue with an instrument at the sun's angle.
To determine what is in the throat, and what is not visible but hidden within it, one should induce vomiting in the patient before their food has been digested in the stomach, for perhaps the lodged object will emerge through vomiting or the patient might swallow a piece of string or a fragment of food.
or they might swallow a dry piece of bread or take a piece of soft seaweed, tie it to a thread, and swallow it. When it reaches the location of the bone, quickly pull on the thread, doing this several times.
Often, the bone or fishbone becomes stuck and can be extracted by these means. If it does not come out as mentioned above, use an instrument made of lead in the following shape: .
It should be slightly thicker than a rod and have a curved end that the patient inserts into their throat gently while lifting their head, taking care not to touch their throat to avoid coughing. The doctor can also use their hand to insert it.
The insertion of the sick person is better for his knowledge of the location of the embedded object, and it pushes or pulls his hand with the tool to the desired position until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
In the removal of a lodged phlegm from the throat.
If the treatment of the phlegm with the mentioned remedies does not succeed, look then at the patient's throat in the sunlight after pressing his tongue with the tool described to you.
If you spot the phlegm, draw it with a small hook or a delicate, firm forceps. If that is not possible, take an evacuated tube, insert it into the patient's throat near the phlegm, and then insert a heated, protected iron rod into the tube.
Do this several times, and have the patient refrain from drinking water for the entire day. Then, he should take a glass filled with cold water, open his mouth, swish it around, not swallow any of it, and occasionally move the water with his hand.
If the phlegm falls onto the throat when it feels the water, and if it does not come out as described, then dry the throat with smoke from a burnt piece of gum arabic using the tool mentioned for drying the tonsils. Do this several times, and it will fall.
The method of working with incense: Take a vessel in which there is hot coals from a fire, and the vessel has a cover with a hole in the middle. Assemble the end of the instrument into that hole, then throw the incense and have the patient place his mouth at the end of the tube and close his mouth so that the incense does not escape until he knows that the incense has reached his ring.
If the phlegm does not come down, repeat the incense and make the patient endure thirst, eat salt and garlic, and do not drink water; in this way, it must certainly come out through this treatment. This is a picture of an instrument that attracts the phlegm from the throat if one looks at it.
It resembles a hook as you can see, except it has this bend that enters the throat, and both ends resemble a bird's beak with its rough sawtooth; if one presses on something, it does not let go.
Another instrument compresses the tongue, which is a wide ring of iron that fits across the mouth above the tongue; it is inserted into the mouth, leaning on its side, keeping the mouth open against the patient's will and he cannot remove it at all until it is moved away.
The instrument that opens the mouth, designed precisely for this purpose: a metal ring of specific width that fits comfortably over the tongue and within the mouth, leaning on one side to keep the mouth open without the patient's conscious effort.
Chapter Forty.
On the discussion of the speech regarding the formation, treatment, and incision of tumors.
The types of tumors are numerous and varied, as mentioned one by one in this book. They differ in their shell (بطّ) and incision (شقّ) according to two factors: the type of tumor itself and what it contains in terms of moisture.
The second type of distinction is based on the locations where they occur in the body, as a tumor in the head differs from one in the abdomen, and a tumor in a hot spot (لحمى) varies from one in a joint, each with its own rules regarding treatment.
Some tumors should not be incised until the pus within has ripened and reached its fullness, while others require incision even if the purulent matter is not yet fully formed, such as tumors close to joints.
Because if a tumor forms near a joint and its condition persists until it putrifies the surrounding areas, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, leading to a prolonged disability of that body part, or the tumor might be close to a vital organ.
If you delay the incision until the pus ripens, it may cause harm to a vital organ or affect an area near the abdomen, making it difficult to incise (بطّ) even though the tumor is not yet fully formed. Therefore, it is necessary to incise tumors that are close to the abdomen while they are still in an unripened state, lest they putrify and spread internally, becoming a fistula.
When a tumor does not heal, one must know the time when it has matured completely. This is when the pain of the tumor ceases, fever subsides, redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor hardens, and other signs appear.
If possible, the bandage should be placed at the base of the tumor to facilitate the flow of the discharge downwards, or in the thinnest part of the tumor with the most distinct contour. If the tumors are located on the hands or feet, the bandage should extend along the length of the body.
And one should place the bandage around muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, in general, in all flat positions with no curves. However, for those with bends, the bandage should follow accordingly. If the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is better to leave it uncovered.
Until it has completely matured as we have said, one should not bandage it too early, for then the discharge of pus will be abundant and harmful, and its stench may become stuck, and sometimes the tumor's edges may harden and its depth may narrow. Some tumors may be bandaged across the body if necessary or according to what is required by the organ.
For small tumors, a single bandage should be used, while for large tumors, a wide bandage or several cuts should be made according to the tumor's size. Some tumors may require the skin to be scraped and cut if they have become like a cloth.
And it becomes, in a manner, as if it were dead, as is often the case in many ganglions and abscesses, some of which are incised in three angles, and others have part of them cut off like the shape of a palm leaf.
And some use a round incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and other types of incisions; and if it has no head, like a smooth, flat tumor, it should only be bathed simply. If the tumor is large and has collected pus over a long period, do not rush to drain all the pus at once.
Instead, remove some of it and then compress the tumor until another day, then remove some more pus, repeating this process gradually until all of it is out.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a very young child, or an old person, the animal spirit (vital force) often dissolves with each discharge of pus; so much so that the patient might die without your realizing it. Be extremely careful in this matter.
After compressing these tumors, clean the wound and examine it; if the tumor's wound is small or the incision simple, use old linen or cotton string. If the tumor is large and the compressions numerous, consider other methods.
Then, insert a string in each incision until they connect; if the tumor has detached some skin or formed an abscess, stuff it with old cotton or linen beard without moisture and compress it for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a piece of cotton fabric in them and apply it to the bleeding area repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should employ the measures, treatments, and applications described in many places within this book and its sections. If it is winter and the area with the swelling has many nerves, you should soak bandages in a hot drink and oil.
Place them on the area. If it is summer and the conditions are hot, you should soak the bandages in cold water and oil or a drink and oil, as mentioned. This should be done for three days, after which the swelling should be drained and cleaned.
Treat it with similar things until it heals. This is all the knowledge needed to treat tumors in general, and each type of tumor has been described previously in detail, summarized in a clear manner.
Chapter Forty-One.
On the incision of tumors that occur on the scalp.
There are small tumors on the scalp, which belong to a category of conditions called "surlins," enclosed in bags that have specific properties, similar to a chicken's ovary. There are many types, some are fatty and others contain moisture like mud.
Some have a moisture similar to wool or porridge, and others are solid and rocky. All of them pose no danger in terms of incising and extracting them, unless a vessel (artery) stands in the way during incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument depicted below, known as a drill, to determine what they contain. If they hold moisture, make an incision along their length with a simple cut, as illustrated.
Begin the incision from line ~B~ to line ~C~. Once the moisture has drained, peel and completely remove the sac containing that moisture, leaving no part of it untouched, as it often returns if any remains.
Then, dip a cotton swab in pure honey (if available), or alternatively in salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it until the following day, as it will consume any remaining sac tissue. Repeat the process of applying the cotton swab with honey a second and third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that no part of the sac remains, then treat the wound with remedies until it heals. If the mass contains fatty tissue, incise it as illustrated.
Make two perpendicular incisions and use forceps to pull the edges of the wound apart. Peel it from all sides, and strive to remove the peritoneum that contains it. If a vessel (artery) stands in the way, follow the instructions provided for you after this, and do the same for a hard mass.
The treatment, as mentioned, is specific, and the incision on the solidified tumor is easier because it contains little blood or moisture. Some of these tumors in the head in certain people have no moisture at all, so much so that when I incise a tumor, there is no fluid to drain.
On the head of an elderly woman, I found a tumor as hard as a solid stone, rough and white, so firm that it could not be broken, even if someone threw a blow at it. Such tumors are similar to those that occur on the heads of children.
At the bases of the ears, make a simple incision through all of them and ensure the flap is from below, allowing the discharge to flow downward. Then treat it with the appropriate method.
Chapter Forty-Two
In the incision on pigs that occur in the neck, these tumors often appear in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins, and they can also appear elsewhere on the body. Some may be solitary, while others are numerous, and some may develop from one another.
Each of these tumors has a separate membrane, similar to the membranes surrounding organs in the body, as is the case with tumors inside the skull, as we described earlier. There are many types of these pigs; some are solid, others contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
What I observed of its condition upon examination was good; it appeared similar to skin in color and moved in all directions, not attached to the neck's nerve, tendon, artery, or depressed. It is necessary to make a simple incision from above to below the body, following this line (~J~) to (~B~):
And peel it from all sides, expanding the skin's lips with a hook or hooks or many hooks if necessary, as we mentioned regarding tumors of the head. Gradually extract it, leaving no vein or nerve cut on the neck, and let the blade be not too sharp.
To prevent your hand from making additional cuts or disturbing the patient, do not cut what you do not need to cut. If you cut a vein or artery and are hindered from continuing, apply powdered glass or some fine grit to stop the bleeding.
Bandage the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes, and it is about to putrefy. At that time, the blood will stop flowing, then return to your work until you are finished. Then, check with your index finger if any remain, small last pieces, cut them off and clean them.
If there is a large vein in the root of the pig, do not cut off that small pig from its root, but rather tie it with a double thread tightly and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm. Then fill the wound with old cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment and treat it.
If the entire pig is cut, one should gather the edges of the wound and sew it up immediately after realizing that no flesh remains, except for the bone of the pig.
One should aim to cut through the flesh and bone, using stitching as mentioned. For pig parts that retain moisture, apply a simple bandage where it appears healed, and ensure the bandage is placed below as advised.
Then, use a twist of Egyptian ointment or similar to cover what remains of the corruption. Once you see the wound has healed, treat it with flesh-regenerating ointments until it is fully cured.
Chapter 34.
In the incision of the throat, a tumor occurring within the pharynx.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen it practiced in our land, and this is their manner of speaking. As for those suffering from strangulation, they should avoid the incision in the throat, as it is not beneficial to them.
In order that all the veins and lung are not damaged, and for those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no issue with the trachea, the incision in the throat should be used to escape the damage that may occur from strangulation.
If we wish to do so, we should make three incisions in the larynx below the rings of the trachea, or four small transverse incisions between two rings, as deep as the incision in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This location corresponds to the incision.
Since it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant, if the physician is timid, he should stretch the throat skin with a hook and cut the skin until it reaches the trachea, avoiding blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should make an incision in the peritoneum that we described, and he can determine the location of the tracheal incision from the mucus that comes out with it, and from the loss of voice and leaving the wound open for a while. Once the time when suffocation was feared passes, he should close the wound by bringing together the edges of the skin.
He should then operate only on the cartilage-free part, and use drugs to promote tissue regeneration until healing occurs. According to the author of this book, when they observe that the patient's throat is blocked by one of the mentioned tumors, this is what the preceding explanation refers to.
When the patient is on the brink of death, and he himself feels that he cannot breathe, they should make an incision in the larynx so that the patient can breathe through the wound, thus saving him from death. They are instructed to keep the wound open until the illness subsides, which may take around three days or so.
When they saw that, they ordered the wound to be stitched and treated until it healed. I have personally witnessed a servant taking a knife and cutting through part of her lung with it; she was then called for treatment, and upon examination, I found her bleeding heavily as if she were being slaughtered. I exposed the wound.
I found that the blood coming from the wound was thin, which convinced me that she had not cut any arteries or veins, and air was exiting through the wound. I then cleaned the wound and treated it until it healed, and nothing else happened to the servant except a slight sound when breathing.
After several days, she recovered completely, which is why we say that cutting the throat poses no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four
On the incision of the tumor that is exposed in the pharynx from the outside and is called the "pharyngeal fistula.
This tumor, called the pharyngeal fistula, is a large growth that resembles the patient's skin tone and is more common in women. It has two types.
It can either be natural or accidental. The natural one is beyond any control, while the accidental one has two types: one resembling fatty tissue and the other a tumor that forms from arterial complications, both of which pose a risk upon incision. It is not appropriate to expose them with iron at all, except for what is small if you explore and examine it with a probe and find that it resembles fatty tissue and is not attached to any vessels, then cut it as you would cut merchandise. Remove the content from the sac if it is in one, or thoroughly investigate and then treat the area as appropriate.
Chapter Forty-Five
On cutting according to the types of merchandise.
The types of merchandise are numerous, and all have been mentioned in the classification. Here, we must distinguish between merchandise and extractions, which is complex. I say that extractions are characterized by heat, fever, and severe pain until the excess fluid subsides. And then, the abscess matures, and the fever and severity subside. Unlike extractions, merchandise is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain. It is enclosed in a sac of serous membrane, which serves as its special casing, resembling the color of the body. Its onset is like a pea, and it expands to the size of a duck egg or larger.
They are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture. The colors of the moisture vary, as mentioned in the classification. When treating merchandise, it is essential to probe and examine it first with a tool called a probe (as depicted in the following chapter).
Estimate the size of the tumor, then remove the probe and observe what comes out as a result. If it is an exudate, regardless of color, make a simple incision as mentioned for other tumors. If no exudate comes out after the probe, know that it is fatty.
Make a cross-incision on it as you were taught, using this figure, and hang it with pincers. Gently peel the skin from all sides, taking care to preserve the sac if possible so that it can be removed intact along with the tumor.
If the sac ruptures during the procedure and you are unable to remove it intact, this often happens, so cut it into pieces until nothing remains. For if any part of it is left behind, whether small or large, the wound will tend to become infected.
If you are unable to remove it entirely and only a small part remains, thoroughly clean the wound with some sharp, consumable abrasives, close the incision, and apply hot compresses as well as other remedies until healing occurs. If the tumor is large, draw lines around its edges to seal them and treat it with adhesive remedies.
If you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vein and bleeding occurs, quickly apply powdered ash to the area, keeping it tight for two or three days until the wound becomes gangrenous and the blood flow stops. Then return to cutting away what remains of the tumor.

In the Figures of Instruments.
Which operate in the incision and cavity, images of scalpels, three types of which are large, medium, and small.
Image of a large scalpel:
Image of a medium scalpel:
Image of a small scalpel:
Made of steel, the blades are square-ended and sharp to facilitate entry into tumors. These are images of the saws (or "bards"), and they are also categorized into three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large saw:
Image of a medium saw:
Image of a small saw:
Suitable for examining tumors, wounds, and narrow spaces to locate bones or other objects within. They are made as smooth, rounded tools, similar to files, from materials such as brass, copper, iron, or silver, with the best quality being those crafted from copper or bronze (aspadroia).
Surgical Drills Can Also Be Made from Black Lead and Are Suitable for Piercing Diverticulas with Curves, So That They Bend with the Curve. They Too Come in Three Types: Long, Medium, and Short.
According to the depth of each diverticulum and adjusting its thickness according to the capacity and narrowness of the diverticulum, a large lead drill:
A medium lead drill:
A small lead drill:
Images of forceps, which come in many types: simple ones with a single claw, and three categories: large, medium, and small. There are also blind forceps, with three types, clawed forceps with two claws, and curved forceps with two claws. They come in three types, and among them are forceps with three claws, also in three types. All these varieties require specific applications; a large simple forceps: A medium simple forceps: A small simple forceps:
Picture of a large blind hook. Picture of a middle blind hook.
Picture of a small blind hook.
Picture of a large hook with two prongs. Picture of a middle-sized hook with two prongs. Picture of a small hook with two prongs.
Picture of a large hook with three prongs.
Picture of a middle-sized hook with three prongs. Picture of a small hook with three prongs.
And these are images of scalpels that cut and excise flesh and tumors, which come in three types: large, medium, and small. Picture of a large scalpel.
Picture of a medium scalpel.
A small surgical knife:
The blades used to make incisions, their reach is limited, while the other ends are unrestricted, designed to aid in the removal of skin without damaging arteries or nerves, providing comfort to the patient and temporary relief from the discomfort caused by removing the growth.
And here are images of the knives, which come in three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large scalpel:
It is made of a type of copper that resembles half-rounded steel used for cauterization, with a broad spoon-like end consisting of two layers. Within the head of the instrument, there is a blade hidden, resembling the tongue of a bird, which can be extended inward and outward as desired.
Images of the instruments used to pinch and remove tumors, which are placed between the fingers and invisible to the patient. There are three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large tumor-removing instrument:
Images of scalpels used to cut through bleeding, which come in three types: large, medium, and small. Image of the large scalpel.
They are made of copper or round steel, slightly longer than necessary, and must be sharp; these types of scalpels, both large and small, should be in your possession to cut through blood quickly when needed, especially when no medicine is available.
However, they should not be used to cut through blood at all parts of the body, but only in fleshy areas such as the muscles of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, abdomen, and groin, and other similar wet fleshy organs.
And one can make other small instruments from them, resembling pistachio shells as shown in this image.
These can be used to cut through blood when it flows from a phlebotomist's puncture site, or when cutting a vein or artery. They can also be made round as shown in this image.
Chapter LXXIV.
In the treatment of men's breasts.
Which, resembling the breast of women, may become swollen in some people at the age of puberty, resembling the breast of women, and forming an unsightly bulge, those who dislike it should make a half-moon shaped incision on the breast.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~: Then, remove all the fat, and fill the wound with a mixture of salt and medicine, then close the edges of the wound with stitching, and treat it until it heals; if the breast tilts downwards and relaxes due to its bone structure, as is the case for women.
Then, make two incisions on its upper sides in the shape of a half-moon, connecting at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller one as shown. From line ~B~ to line ~C~, then peel the skin between the incisions, remove the fat, and use the stitching and bandages as mentioned, along with any necessary treatment, until it heals.
If you fail to discern what needs to be cut in order to alleviate the patient's distress or prevent excessive blood loss, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in a consumable ointment and leave it until the remaining fat is consumed, after which you may treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Eight
In the case of tumors under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the type known as "swine" (hard, containing a sac), and some contain moisture. In such cases, you should make a semi-circular incision in the shape shown here.
From line "B" to line "C," once you have drained all the contents from the tumor using cotton soaked in a suitable agent, leave it for a day or two before removing the cotton.
Treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type known as "swine" (hard, containing a sac), make an incision as we described for swine tumors; if the wound continues to discharge pus, apply heat treatment as mentioned earlier.
Chapter Forty-Nine
In the incision of the tumor that is exposed by the artery or vein and is called aneurysm.
If the artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, a tumor often develops from it; likewise, a vein may exhibit swelling and a tumor.
And the signs by which it is known whether the tumor and swelling are from an artery or a vein: if the tumor is from an artery, it is rectangular and located deeply in the body; if you press the tumor with your finger, you feel a creaking sensation.
And if it is from a vein, the tumor is round on the surface of the body; the incision on these tumors is dangerous, especially those located in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many places on the body, and they are very great in size, so one should avoid treating them with iron.
And what concerns those in the limbs or head, one should avoid them; for if it is a swelling of an artery, make an incision along its length in the skin, then open the slit with forceps, remove the artery from the adhesions.
Until it is exposed, then insert an needle under it and penetrate it to the other side, tighten the artery with a doubled thread at two points as I have taught you for the arteries in the neck; then use a scalpel to knock on the spot between the bands until all the blood comes out of it.
When the tumour dissolves, the treatment that produces pus is then used until the bands (or ligaments) fall off, after which they are treated with appropriate ointments until healing occurs.
If the tumour is located next to a vein, hold as much of the tumour and skin in your hand as possible, then insert an needle below that point and push it through, with a doubled thread attached, until you exit from the opposite side. Then, tie the tumour securely as previously described when tying a grape, using both ends of the thread. If you are concerned that the threads will slip, insert another needle with a new thread beneath the entire tumour at the point where the first needle crossed.
Tighten your threads at four points, then make a cut in the middle of the tumour. Once the contents have been extracted, cut away any excess skin and apply a dressing soaked in a mixture of wine and oil. Then use the treatment involving twisting and ointments until healing occurs.
Chapter Fifty
On tumours that expose nerve twisting.
As the tumor appears in the artery and vein, so it appears in the nerve if a blow occurs or results from excessive fatigue, and so on, and this is most common in the wrists and ankles.
In every location where joints move, there is a firm tumor that resembles the color of the rest of the body. In most cases, it is painless. If pressed strongly, the patient feels a numbness similar to paralysis, and the tumor is not concentrated in deep tissues.
On the contrary, it is located under the skin and moves in all directions, neither advancing nor retreating. As for what is found in joints, it should not be treated with iron, as it may cause permanent damage. And what is found in the head or forehead should not be subjected to such treatment.
Make a cut in the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, use a tweezers to grasp and cut it from the root. If it is large, hang it on a hook and peel it off, then remove it and close the wound with stitches and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty
On cutting moles that appear on the stomach.
They may often appear on some people's stomachs and other parts of their bodies as moles called fungous because they resemble fungi in shape. Their base is thin, but their head is thick. Sometimes their edges turn inward, and they can vary in size, from very small to extremely large.
And I have seen a man with two growths in his abdomen, similar to mushrooms, with no distinction between them; their bases were thin and their edges had turned inward and fissured, and moisture was constantly seeping from them. So I cut them off, and weighed one at eighteen ounces and the other at six or seven ounces.
In performing the cut, observe: if the patient is moist and the tumor white, damp, and thin in origin, then cut it with a broad blade; be prepared with hot irons, as blood often flows profusely upon cutting.
If blood flows excessively, apply a hot iron. If the patient is timid and frightened of having the tumor cut with iron, take a fine metal thread, tighten it around the tumor, and leave it for two days; then increase the tension on the thread until the tumor detaches.
Whenever the tumor is cut and detaches on its own without difficulty, this is a good sign; however, if it is thick in origin, cutting it may be risky, especially when located in the abdomen. It may be possible to cut off half or some part of it.
Then apply a hot iron to prevent it from returning; then treat the wound until it heals. Be cautious when cutting a tumor that is pale in color, lacking sensation, and unappealing in appearance, as it may be a cancerous growth, which we will discuss later.
Chapter LXXV.
In the treatment of navel hernia.
A navel hernia may result from various causes, such as a tear in the peritoneum (the membrane lining the abdominal cavity) allowing the omentum (a fold of abdominal fat and tissue) or intestine to protrude, similar to other types of hernias. It can also be caused by blood from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned, or due to excessive gas accumulation within the hernia.
If the hernia is due to a tear in the peritoneum allowing the omentum or intestine to protrude, the swelling will resemble the body's natural tissues, be soft without pain, and change its position. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, its position and characteristics will differ as described. If you press it with your fingers, it will disappear then return, and it may be accompanied by borbing sounds and become significantly larger during defecation, indicating a possible fecal impaction. If caused by moisture (or fluid), it will be soft.
If pressing it with your hand does not make it disappear, its size does not change, and it doesn't become more pronounced or smaller, then it is likely caused by blood. In this case, the hernia will appear black, indicating bleeding. If due to growing tissue (or scar tissue), the swelling will be firm, consistent in size, and not easily reducible.
If it is caused by the wind, its touch will be gentle. The procedure is to observe: if the hernia is due to arterial or venous blood or wind, one should refrain from treating it, as there is fear of complications and uncertainty, as I have explained in the chapter on tumors caused by arteries and veins.
If the hernia is due to the intestines or fat, one should order the patient to hold himself firmly and stand upright, then trace around the navel with a pen. Then, you should order the patient to lie down on his back between your hands, and cut around the navel with a broad blade where you have marked with ink. Then, pull the middle of the hernia upward with a large forceps, and tie the cut edge tightly with a strong thread or catgut.
The tie should be a simple knot. Then, open the hernia sac and insert your index finger to explore. If the intestine is caught in the knot, loosen the knot and push the intestine back into the abdominal cavity. If it is fat (throb), use forceps to extend it.
Cut away the excess. If you encounter an artery or vein, tie it tightly and return to your work. Take two needles and insert two strong threads into the cut, passing the needles through the hernia wall in opposite directions. Then, pull the hernia tight at four points with the needles.
If you prefer to remove the needles and leave the site until the flesh, having been stretched, becomes gangrenous and falls off or is cut off when it softens and becomes gangrenous, then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals, for if it is a navel hernia, the flesh containing it will heal.
Or if there is moisture, you should incise the mass as we mentioned and drain the blood or moisture found within it, then treat it with what seals the wound.
Chapter Thirty-Five
In the treatment of cancer.
As we have mentioned in the classification, there are types of cancer, and the path to treating them with medication, while warning against treating them with iron, as it may become gangrenous. We also discussed cancer that develops in the womb, cautioning against its treatment.
The pioneers stated that when cancer is in a location that can have it entirely removed, such as breast or thigh cancer, or other organs capable of removal, it should be excised entirely, especially if it is small and newly formed. However, when it has progressed and become large, it should not be approached.
For I have not been able to heal anyone, and I have not seen anyone before me achieve that. If you are able to act as we mentioned, the treatment should be advanced, making the sick person easy from the black plague in several instances, but if it is in the veins with obvious congestion, it should be interrupted.
Then prepare the patient for treatment, and then apply to the cancer the appropriate pins, and cut it from all sides with the skin, thoroughly, until nothing remains of its roots, and allow the blood to flow without cutting it off quickly.
If, while working, you encounter a thick flow of blood, squeeze the areas with your hand or any available instruments; if it obstructs your work, it causes great bleeding from the cutting of an artery or vein, then remove the clot until the blood stops, and treat it with all other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Five.
In the treatment of constipation.
We have previously discussed the types of edema, how water accumulates, and the characteristics of each type, as well as their treatments with medications. The type treated with iron is solely the edematous type; it should not be confused with the type caused by heat or that related to flesh, in any case.
If this approach fails, as the edematous type is resistant to treatment with medications, examine the patient for signs of extreme weakness or other illnesses that could be contributing factors, such as a disease unrelated to constipation.
If the patient exhibits symptoms such as coughing, diarrhea, or others, do not treat them with iron; it is misguided. If you examine the patient and they appear strong, suffering only from constipation without any other accompanying illnesses, and are neither a child nor an elderly person, then the course of action is to have the patient stand between your hands. A servant behind him squeezes his abdomen with his hands and pushes the water downwards towards the groin, then takes a chisel-like instrument in this manner:
A long, two-sided instrument resembling a scalpel, except it has a slight concave curve to prevent it from penetrating into the intestines during operation, which would cause harm. Then, examine if the hernia has originated from the side of the intestines.
It is necessary to make the incision three fingers below the navel, following the curve of the abdomen towards the groin. If the hernia originates from liver disease, make the incision on the left side of the navel, also three fingers deep. If it originates from spleen disease, make the incision on the right side, likewise three fingers deep.
The incision should not be made on the side that the patient prefers to lie on, as this may cause excess fluid to accumulate in that weak area. Then, use an instrument to puncture the skin completely and insert it into the incision, raising your hand.
Using the scalpel, make an incision between the skin and peritoneum as if you were peeling it, removing about as much as a fingernail. Then, puncture the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches a hollow space (the sac containing the fluid), remove the scalpel, and insert the instrument in the hole.
It is a semi-cylindrical tube made of a thin cane crafted from silver, copper, or polished smooth bronze with a small hole at the bottom and three holes on each side, two on one side and one on the other as you can see.
And one end may be sharpened to resemble the shape of the nib of a pen as shown here: .
At the upper end is a ring, so when the instrument reaches the water, it descends from its own weight onto the instrument, thereby emptying the water at a moderate rate; for if you empty more than is appropriate in that time, the patient might die due to dissolution of his animal spirit.
or it may present a membrane close to death, but he should vomit from it according to his strength and what indicates the patient's condition in terms of pulse power and good color, then remove the instrument and stop the water, as it is retained for its own time.
due to the skin that covers the hole in the peritoneum, which I told you to secure in that manner, then return the instrument another day if you see that the patient is likely to recover.
It also removes a small amount of water, doing so over several days while on the patient's neck and taking care not to make any errors so that there is only a slight remainder of water; if you are concerned for the patient and left too much water, treat him by burial in hot sand.
Excessive sweating in the bath or under the sun, endure thirst and treat with drying medications until recovery. Apply heat to the stomach, liver, and spleen after expelling the water as described previously.
Chapter LXXV.
In the treatment of children born with unpierced or narrow or incorrectly positioned urethral openings.
Some boys may emerge from their mother's womb with an unpierced perineum, and it is necessary to promptly perform the piercing as soon as they are born.
With a very fine scalpel, as illustrated below:
Then, insert a very thin lead wire through the opening and secure it with binding, leaving it for three or four days. When the patient feels the urge to urinate, gently remove and replace it. Without the use of lead, there is a risk that the urine flowing over the area may prevent the opening from closing.
For those with a narrow opening, treatment with lead as mentioned for several days helps to widen it. Those born with the opening in the wrong position, such that they cannot urinate forward, are also treated in this manner.
Until the urethra is raised above and no semen reaches the womb straight, it is a very ugly condition, and the treatment for this is to have the patient lie on their back.
Then, with your left hand, stretch the urethra firmly and use a blade or a sharp knife, as if carving, to create a central opening in the head of the urethra, ensuring it is precisely located in the middle, as desired.
Be careful during the procedure to prevent blood loss, as it often occurs. Confront it with what stops the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter LXV.
In the discharge that occurs in the foreskin, urethra, and glans, as well as in cases of blackness, putrefaction, and adhesions between the foreskin and urethra.
This discharge often occurs in the urethra, forming a white, foul-smelling puss, which can be either benign or malignant. The benign discharge should be gently pulled with a fine hook.
Cut it until it is completely cleaned, then apply a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment. Subsequently, treat it with Nabali ointment until healing occurs. However, if the discharge is foul-smelling and malignant in color, burning (cauterization) should be applied after cutting and removing it.
If the fistula is within the foreskin, it should be treated without circumcision. Some fistulas are internal, and some external; in this case, the internal fistula should be removed first, and then when it has healed, it can be treated externally.
For if you treat them both together, the foreskin may tear; it also may turn black and corrupt in women or the foreskin, so all that has turned black or is corrupting should be cut off.
Then apply honey mixed with powdered pomegranate peel and alum, and treat it with other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use a half-moon iron to cauterize it as follows: .
Cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, that is, bleeding and the wound if it becomes infected. If the membrane dissolves completely, it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the sick person can urinate through it. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans, .
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is intact and does not require circumcision; it may also occur due to a wound or tumor. Therefore, remove the foreskin with a blunt scalpel to loosen the bond and release the glans from all sides.
If the diagnosis is difficult after examination, it is necessary to peel off a part of the foreskin and the glans, as the foreskin is thin and may tear quickly due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin from the glans using a thin cotton cloth that has been soaked in cold water so as not to stick either.
Then treat it with a contracting drink until it heals.
Chapter LXXVII.
In the purification of boys and the treatment of what befalls them of errors.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of union, like any other surgical procedure. However, since it is an act done by our will and practiced especially in boys, we must delineate the best practice in it.
And the easiest way to achieve safety is that I say the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their laws, but it is something we acquired.
By experience, for I have found that the majority of practitioners and healers use purification with musk and scissors, and also use cauterization, tying with thread, and cutting with the fingernail, and I have tried all these methods.
I found no better method than cleansing with scissors and binding with thread, for the use of the scalpel often damages the skin because the foreskin's skin has two layers, and it is possible to cut off the upper layer while leaving the lower one intact.
He is then forced to make another cut and endure continued pain, as cleansing with a flint does not ensure the removal of the tip of the urethra, as it may have entered its hole. Furthermore, cleansing with a nail might cause the skin to slip and spoil your work, or if the foreskin's skin is naturally short.
Often, they are born in such a state that no cleansing is required, and I have witnessed this. The method of cleansing with scissors and binding with thread has proven superior to me through experience, as the scissor's cut is harmonious with the lower blade.
When you press your hand, allowing the two blades to meet in harmony, they cut with one size and at the same time, making the thread's grip similar to a wall around the urethra from all sides, ensuring no error whatsoever. The primary goal is to make the boy comfortable.
In particular, if he is someone who understands a little, you should only tie the thread to his urethra and leave it for another day, then delight him and make him happy in every way possible. Make him stand tall between your hands.
Do not have the scalpel concealed in your sleeve or under your foot while examining the patient. Ensure the child's eyes do not fall upon it or any of the instruments. Then, insert your hand into the urethra and inflate the skin, lifting it upwards to expose the head of the urethra.
Then, clean it of any accumulated dirt. Later, secure the marked area with a doubled thread and tie a second knot slightly below. Hold the lower knot firmly with your index finger and thumb and cut between the two knots. Then, quickly lift the skin upwards to expose the head of the urethra and allow a little blood to flow, as this helps reduce swelling. Later, dry it with a damp cloth and sprinkle it with ashes from burnt dried squash or fine sand, both of which are excellent remedies.
Then, quickly lift the skin upwards to expose the head of the urethra and allow a little blood to flow, as this helps reduce swelling. Later, dry it with a damp cloth and sprinkle it with ashes from burnt dried squash or fine sand, both of which are excellent remedies. Then, place a piece of egg white cooked in rosewater and mixed with fresh rose fat on the wound, leaving it there until the next day. After that, treat it with all other remedies until healing occurs.
And this is an image of the scalpel suitable for cleansing.
It should be a sharp, straight scalpel with handles of equal length, watering the nail and cutting edge. If there is any error in cleansing, and the skin inside turns or some of it does, you should extend it from your clock using your fingernail before the area swells.
If you cannot cut it evenly with your fingernail, use a hook and pull it out, then cut it. If after three days the area below the head of the urethra remains swollen, hot, and painful, leave it until the heat subsides, then peel it gently.
Cut it as best you can, but be careful not to harm the head of the urethra. If any part of the head of the urethra is cut, it will not cause harm. Treat the wound with the powders described in the section on powders.
If the skin above the urethra is cut and shrinks upwards, it will not cause much harm. Treat it as we have described until it heals.
Chapter LVIII.
On the treatment of urinary retention in the bladder.
Urinary retention in the bladder occurs when it is blocked by a stone, congealed blood, pus, or flesh growth, among other things. Treat this as we have described in the sections (or categories) of treatment outlined.
If urine cannot be released and you notice that retention is due to a stone that has damaged the bladder neck, the patient should sit on their knees with their back against a wall and then have someone lie down on top of them, pressing their stomach towards their spine. The patient should hold this position as long as possible.
When the bladder's neck is forced to push the stone backward, urine flows out. If it does not flow as mentioned and the condition of the patient worsens, the stone should be removed using a tool called a catheter, which has this form: (illustrates a catheter).
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth, and hollow like a feather pipe, approximately one and a half inches long. It has a delicate cone-shaped tip and a urination funnel at the other end. To use it, take a folded string and tie a woolen ball or cotton to its end securely.
Insert the string end into the catheter's bottom and use a knife to trim any remaining wool so that it can slide easily inside the tube, acting as a plug. Then, grease the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white, and have the patient sit on a chair.
The bladder and urethra are washed with wet oils or oil and warm water, then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches its origin. Bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter further inside.
Until the urethra is bent and the catheter is pushed inside, reaching close to the perineum. Then tilt the penis downwards while the catheter remains inside, and push it further until it reaches the bladder, where the patient will feel that it has reached an empty space.
It is prepared in this manner because the passage through which urine flows is curved; then, the string is extended with a slight twist, and the urine follows the string, after which it is removed and the urine flows out, and the catheters are replaced.
Continue this process until the bladder is emptied, and the patient feels relief.
Chapter LIX
How to inject the bladder with liquid.
And images of the instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or hollowed ivory with a long, delicate tube. You intend to drip water and medicine into it, and this is done with an instrument called a 'zarraqah', and here is its image.
Made of silver or hollowed ivory, it has a long tube with a delicate, hollow interior, except for the end which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you can see.
The hollow space where the tubes are located is just large enough to accommodate them without any excess, so that when you draw in some moisture, it follows the tube, and if you push it out, it moves forward as if it were a syringe used to pump oil during naval battles.
If you wish to expel moistures from the bladder, insert the tip of the catheter into the moisture and draw it upwards with the pump, then the moisture will be attracted inside the catheter and its tip will enter the urethra, as we described in the catheters, and then push the moisture out with the pump.
Then that moisture reaches the bladder to the extent that the patient feels it, and this is a figure of a delicate syringe with which the bladder is injected: .
It is made of silver or brass, with its upper part resembling a small cone and a groove at the bottom where the string fits, then take a camel's bladder and put in it the moisture you wish to inject into the bladder, then tie it tightly between the grooves with a doubled thread.
Warm that moisture slightly over the fire, then insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra, and tighten your hand on the bladder with the moisture firmly until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a thin piece of cloth and make a circle from it, punch holes all around, then insert a tight string through those holes as you would a needle, and gather the circle to form a sac after placing in it what you want of moistures, oils, or water.
Then bind it to the instrument and use it as you used the bladder, with your hand's pressure, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter LXX (Sixtieth Chapter)
On Removing Stones
We have previously discussed the types of stones, their treatment with medications, and the distinction between stones formed in the kidneys versus those formed in the bladder, along with their respective symptoms. We also mentioned the stone that requires manual manipulation or incision.
This refers to the stone formed specifically in the bladder, which becomes lodged in the urethra, and I shall describe this condition clearly and concisely.
I state that stones formed in the bladder are more common among young boys, and their symptoms include urine that exits the bladder resembling water due to its lightness.
It appears sandy, causing itching and irritation to the penis, and often hangs down, leading to a prolapse of the anus in many cases. It is easier for young boys to recover from this condition before reaching 14 years of age, while it becomes more challenging for the elderly. In adolescents, the duration between onset and recovery is typically around four to five years.
The treatment is easier for those with larger stones, while smaller ones are the opposite. When resorting to treatment, it is first necessary to inject the patient with a solution that expels all waste in their intestines, as it may prevent the stone from being found during examination.
Then the patient is taken by the feet, shaken and lowered so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place several times, then sits between your hands with his back straight and his hands under his thighs, making the bladder tilt completely downwards, then examine him.
Feel it from outside; if you sense the stone in the space, immediately use your scalpel to slice through it. If it does not fall under your touch at all, you should smear the thumb (of the left hand for a boy, or the middle finger) with oil from your right hand.
If it is a fully grown boy, insert your finger into his rectum and search for the stone until it is under your finger, then gently move it to the neck of the bladder, press down on it with your finger, and push it outward towards the area you intend to cut.
Order a servant to squeeze the bladder with their hand, and another to extend the patient's thighs with one hand and pull the skin under the testicles towards the area where the incision will be made. Then take the scalpel as shown:
Incision Between the Anus and Vulva: Not in the Middle, but to the Side of the Left Hip; The Incision Should Be Made with the Same Amount of Pressure as a Stone and Your Finger in the Anus, Expelling It in a Curved Motion to Make the External Incision Wide and Internal Incision Narrow, Allowing the Stone to Pass Out as Much as Possible.
Do not press too hard, as you might push the stone in the anus with your finger during the incision, causing it to pass out easily. Be aware that some stones have angles and edges, making their passage more difficult.
Some stones are smooth, resembling a nut, and roll out easily; for those with angles and edges, make a slightly deeper incision, or use a pincers to grasp them firmly, with one end shaped like a file.
Secure the stone with a pair of pincers, shaping one end to prevent it from slipping, or insert a delicate, curved tool under the stone. If these methods fail, slightly widen the incision. If blood persists, cauterize it with cautery.
If there are multiple stones, first dislodge the larger one into the bladder, then make an incision on it, and subsequently push out the smaller ones. If a stone is extremely large, it is misguided to make a deep incision on it, as it may expose the patient to one of two risks.
Either he dies or he suffers permanent dribbling of urine, because the wound never heals. Try to force it out or, if necessary, break it with clamps until it comes out completely.
Once you have finished treating the wound with cauterization, patience, and tweezers, tighten it and make a wet patch with oil, elixir, or lard and cold water to soothe the hot swelling. Then, the patient should lie on their back without loosening the bandage until the third day.
If it heals, wash the wound with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with nettle paste and basil paste until it recovers. If a hot swelling, pain, or similar occurs, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing urination, this is indicated by the presence of blood in the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove the clot, as leaving it can lead to bladder corruption and infection. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, applying appropriate treatments for each condition until it heals.
During treatment, it is essential to bind and compress the thighs to aid in the application of medications to the wound. If the stone is small and lodges in the urethra, causing urinary retention, treat it with the described methods before it worsens.
Often, this treatment replaces the need for incision. I have tried this method, which involves taking a forceps made of steel, as illustrated below.
The forceps is a triangular instrument with a sharp, pointed end, embedded in a stick. Take a thread and tie it to the forceps beneath the stone so that it does not return to the bladder. Then, gently insert the forceps into the urethra until the forceps reaches the same stone.
Turn the forceps with your hand in the same stone, little by little, aiming to puncture it until it passes through from the other side. Urine will flow naturally. Then, press your hand on the remaining part of the stone outside the penis; it will crumble and come out with the urine, healing the patient.
If this treatment is not feasible due to a blocking obstacle, tie a thread under the stone and another above it. Then, make an incision on the stone along the penis between the two threads and remove it.
Then, untie the thread and clean the dried blood in the wound. You tied the thread under the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and above it to ensure that when the thread is removed after the stone comes out, the skin returns to its place, covering the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns to its place and covers the wound as we have said.
Chapter LXVI.
In removing stones from women.
Stones in women are rare, and if one is detected, it is difficult to treat and impossible for many reasons; one of which is that the woman may be a virgin, and another is that you will not find a woman who allows the physician to examine her.
If she is chaste or related to the physician, thirdly, you will not find a woman skilled in this art, especially manual work, fourthly, the place of incision for the stone in women is distant from where the stone is located, so it needs a deeper cut.
In that there is danger, if necessity demands, one should take a skilled female physician, who is rare to find; if unavailable, seek a chaste and sympathetic doctor or bring in a knowledgeable midwife or a woman who has some knowledge of this art.
She should be instructed to perform all the examinations, beginning with checking if the woman is a virgin; she should insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone. If found, she should press it with her finger.
If she is not a virgin, but married, then you should instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina of the patient and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it firmly.
If the stone is found, it should be removed from the bladder and passed down until it reaches the hip joint, then incise at the entrance to the vagina opposite the base of the thigh where the stone is felt.
Her finger should not leave the stone, pressing it from below. First, make a small incision, then insert a rod into that small incision. If she feels the stone, increase the size of the incision as much as she believes the stone will exit through it. Be aware that there are many types of stones.
They come in various sizes, shapes, and textures: some small or large, smooth or rough, long or round, with or without ridges. Knowing these varieties will help you identify what you need. If blood is abundant, sprinkle powdered ash in the wound and press for a while until the bleeding stops, then resume your treatment.
Until the stone is removed, keep in mind that you have at your disposal the instruments mentioned for extracting stones from men. If blood loss becomes a problem and you notice pulsation indicating an severed artery, apply pressure with the cautery to the affected area.
Secure it with firm ligatures and leave it alone, do not repeat the process and leave the stone untouched; for it may cause harm to the patient. Then, treat the wound. If after a few days the bleeding subsides and the area becomes gangrenous, resume your work until the stone is expelled.
The 62nd Chapter.
On the fissure of the urinary bladder.
The urinary bladder is a collection of moisture in the white mesentery that lies beneath the scrotal skin surrounding the testis, known as the scrotum. It may also have a special membrane assigned to it by nature in one part of the testis.
It may give the impression of another testis, situated between the scrotal skin and the white mesentery that we mentioned, which only occurs rarely. This bladder forms from weakness in the female anatomy, and it may be caused by a blow to the females.
This moisture can have various colors, either yellow, red (blood-like), black (purplish), or white (watery), with the latter being most common. The signs that indicate its presence are as follows.
Where water collects, if it is in the white peritoneum that we have mentioned, the tumor will be slightly elongated into a shape like an egg, and the testicle will not be visible as moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If the moisture is in a membrane specific to it, then the tumor will be rounder, like one end of an egg.
Therefore, a person might mistake it for another egg. If the moisture is between the scrotum and the white peritoneum, it will be sensitive to touch. To determine the color of the moisture, apply a square forceps as depicted in the previous image, and based on what emerges from the forceps, you can judge its inner contents.
If we turn to treatment with iron, then the patient should be ordered to perform phlebotomy if possible and you see their body filled (with fluid), then they should lie on their back on a slightly elevated surface, place multiple layers of cloth underneath, and you should sit on their left side.
You should command a servant to sit on the patient's right side, extending their penis towards one side of the scrotum and towards the direction of the abdominal orifices. Then, take a wide knife and make a longitudinal incision through the middle of the scrotal skin near the groin.
Make the cut straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotal skin into two halves, until it reaches the white peritoneum containing it. Peel away the peritoneum and be careful not to make any further incisions, peeling from the side closest to the egg shape. Remove as much of the membrane as possible.
Then, loosen the peritoneum filled with water by making a wide flap and remove all the water. Then, separate the edges of the incision with forceps and lift the peritoneum upwards without touching the skin covering the testicles. Cut the peritoneum as best as you can, either in one piece or in sections.
Especially, be careful not to cut through the thin side, or you risk the fluid returning. If the egg (testicle) protrudes from its covering during the operation, after removing the peritoneum, sew together the edges of the skin covering the testicles.
Then, treat it like any other wound until it heals. If the testicle has been damaged by a different illness, you should tie off the vessels in the scrotum to prevent bleeding, then cut the testicle from its attachment and remove it, treating the egg (testicle) as we have mentioned.
If the fluid has collected on both sides, know that they are both testicles. Make an incision on the other side as you did before, and perform the same operation, then wipe away the blood.
Insert into the incisions a piece of fabric soaked in oil or rose fat, and make another from outside, soaked in a mixture of wine and oil, and lay it over the testicles and abdomen, placing a folded cloth (bandage) on top. Secure it from above with a bandage that has six sides, as illustrated here.
Then, two pieces of cloth are taken, sewn together, and filled with fluffy wool, as shown here. The ends are shaped with wet cotton or wool and secured tightly in a belt around the waist, one piece extending to the seat and back.
The second one is taken towards the groin, and both ends are placed on the thighs below, while the remaining two ends are secured on the thighs, and all the tension is gathered in a belt around the waist. This garment can also be made by stitching instead of cutting with iron.
Take a thin, sharp iron and make a cut in the scrotum skin while it is still protected, as described. Continue until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed. Then take another iron and press it as shown here:
It resembles a Greek eye, then protect the peritoneum and drain all moisture. Stretch it with pincers and scrape off the layer containing it using the iron. Cut as much as possible until you completely remove all of it and preserve the testis, without exposing them to fire.
Know that this method is safer and prevents blood loss, and it is better than cutting. If you encounter any obstacles during the cut or while pressing, such as a hot tumor, bleeding, or anything else, you should treat them with appropriate remedies as mentioned earlier.
If the patient is timid and cannot bear this treatment due to its repugnant nature, then use the duck as I have described. If it proves effective with you based on the evidence we provided.
If the swelling is filled with water, the patient should sit on a high chair, then cut the swelling at its base with a broad scalpel and place the duck along the body. The incision should be wide enough to allow all the water to drain out, then apply cotton and secure it with a bandage.
Leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat the wound until it heals. If the water does not drain despite your best efforts, it may be due to the white membrane blocking the opening of the wound, preventing the water from escaping.
In such a case, you should insert a duck feather or the instrument used to extract water from bladders (as illustrated), or slightly increase the opening of the wound.
Be aware that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so. If it does, apply the duck in the same manner, and the patient should endure for a few days.
Chapter 63.
On the incision of fleshy tumors and their treatment.
Be aware that making an incision in this gland is one of the risks that lead to death in most cases, so we advise against it and opt for safety. I will mention the procedures involved and the types of tumors.
I say that many tumors can occur in bodies with a composition related to the female reproductive system, and this can be due to several reasons, either from surplus heat that accumulates in the female organs or from a blow, and the tumor's color is similar to that of the body without having water.
The tumor can be hard and possibly calcified, appearing as a dark color without sensation, and it may result from the complex or swollen arteries, as mentioned earlier, or from swollen veins. The absence of pain indicates a tumor dispersion due to artery swelling.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not yield at all; while the one caused by swollen veins does not disperse upon finger pressure, and this type can be difficult to cut through, affecting both the tumor and surrounding tissues.
This involves incising the scrotum, extending the testis upwards, removing it from the white visceral membrane, detaching the vessels, tying them off, and cutting the vas deferens after ensuring that the testis is free from all attached tissues. If the testis has fused with adjacent tissues, this procedure may not be effective.
It is necessary to remove the egg and cut it, and if there is adhesion between any of the membranes or among the vessels, all such adhesions should be freed and cut in a circular manner.
If it is a flesh adhesion in the back of the place, then cut all of it and remove the egg as we said. Once your work is done, thoroughly wash the wound with damp wool soaked in rose oil and drink, then treat it with all other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four
In the treatment of an adenuoma accompanied by a calcaneum.
The calcaneum (dalia) is a tumor twisted with some torsion, resembling a cluster with relaxed anthems (glandular structures), making it difficult for the patient to move, exercise, or walk. In the treatment of this condition, the remedies are similar to those mentioned earlier.
However, we must mention the procedure as described by the ancients: The patient should sit on a high chair, then press the anthema (gland) downward while holding the skin of the testicle with your fingers, along with the vessels close to the penis.
And have another assistant hold it firmly and stretch it, then make a curved incision with a sharp, wide scalpel next to the vessels until they are exposed. Then, peel it from all sides as you described for the arteries in the groin, and insert a needle with a doubled thread into it.
Secure it at the beginning and end of the affected area, then make a straight incision down the middle of the body and remove the accumulated foul moistures.
Then treat the fistula as other wounds that require a period of time for the vessels supplying one of the ovaries to fall, which is not harmful. If the fistula affects all vessels, one ovary should be removed along with the vessels, otherwise the egg will lack nourishment. By cutting the vessels, it wilts and becomes useless.
Chapter 65.
In the treatment of intestinal adenoma.
This adenoma occurs due to an incision that exposes the peritoneum extended across the abdomen towards the groins, causing the intestine to protrude from this hernia into one of the ovaries.
This hernia can either be due to a tear in the peritoneum or its extension, and these types are caused by numerous reasons such as a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting a heavy object, etc. Its sign is that if it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, it occurs gradually over a long period of time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the tumor is level towards the depth before the peritoneum compresses the intestine. Its indication is that if it arises from a tear in the peritoneum, it begins with a severe, sudden pain, and the tumor appears distinct beneath the skin.
If the intestine protrudes and exits the peritoneum, it may carry with it adhesions, and this is called an adherent or a putrid intestine. It can also contain feces that accumulate, leading to the patient's demise.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially if pressed, treating this condition with iron is dangerous, and one should be cautious of such practices. The treatment involves instructing the patient to push the intestine back into its cavity if possible.
Then, the patient lies on their back between your hands and raises their legs. Next, you stretch the skin below the testicles upwards and cut the scrotal sac lengthwise. You then insert hooks into the edges of the incision as needed to keep it open.
The incision should be deep enough to allow the egg to exit. Then, you strip the layers beneath the scrotal skin until the white, tough peritoneum is exposed from all sides. At this point, insert your index finger into the space behind the testis.
Between the white peritoneum beneath the tunica of the testis and the second peritoneal layer, there is a adhesion behind the testis. It is then bent with the right hand towards the interior of the tunica, yet the white peritoneum extends upwards with the left hand, lifting the testis along with the peritoneum to the side of the incision.
The servant is commanded to extend the testis upwards, and you release the adhesion behind it completely. Inspect with your finger to ensure there is no twisted bowel in the rigid white peritoneum. If you find any, push it back into the abdomen below.
Then, take a needle with a thick thread twisted from ten strands and insert it at the end of the peritoneum beneath the tunica of the testis, next to the incision. Then, cut the ends of the looped thread so that there are four strands. Then, arrange them one on top of the other in a crossed manner and tie the peritoneum beneath the tunica of the testis with a strong ligature from both sides. Also, twist the thread ends and tie them tightly so that nothing can reach the vessels supplying them. To prevent any hot swelling and also to create a second ligature outside the first, away from it by less than two fingers, after these ligatures, leave a portion of the peritoneum beneath the tunica of the testis equal in size to a finger.
To prevent any hot swelling and also to create a second ligature outside the first, away from it by less than two fingers, after these ligatures, leave a portion of the peritoneum beneath the tunica of the testis equal in size to a finger. Cut off the remaining tissue in a rounded manner, along with the egg, and then make an incision below the scrotal sac, through which blood and pus will drain, as we have described previously. Afterwards, apply the wool soaked in oil to the wound and use the bandage that we have mentioned.
And the white peritoneum, after it is cut with caution to prevent blood loss, often poses a challenge. Leave the bandage until it falls off on its own. If it does not fall quickly, use hot water to soak it and help it slip off.
Then treat the wound with all the treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter 66.
In this intestinal hernia, I have never seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. The pioneers mentioned that one should proceed as we described for the hernia accompanied by a goiter, tying the vessels after making an incision on them gently below.
Then make an incision in the middle and treat the tumor by opening it, until the vessels fall off, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter 76.
In the hernia that occurs in the groin.
The hernia in the groin may expose itself as we have mentioned, and nothing from the intestine descends into the female part; if it does descend, it is slight and always returns.
However, if time passes, the hernia in the peritoneum increases, allowing the intestine and fat to descend into the scrotum, which is a result of the extended peritoneum in the groin as previously mentioned. This is because the peritoneum extends, relaxes, and then shrinks, causing the hernia to protrude and twist, which can be treated with heat as previously described.
It can also be treated with iron, following this method: the patient lies on their back between your hands, you make a vertical cut in the protruding hernia area, about three fingers wide, then separate the peritoneum layers beneath the skin.
Until the white peritoneum beneath it is exposed, take a strip of cloth, place it on the hernia opening, press it deep into the abdomen, then sew the two edges together, binding them with stitches.
Then take the edge of the cloth, without cutting the peritoneum or touching the testicle or any other structure, as I have taught you for treating intestinal hernias, and treat it with surgical methods.
If the stitches break, clean them and repair the wound until it heals; then the peritoneum will contract and the hernia will not increase in size.
And this method is better at this point because it is closer to safety.
Chapter LXXVI.
In the relaxation of the scrotal skin.
The scrotal skin often relaxes in some people without the muscles inside relaxing, which makes it look ugly. Therefore, when one desires to treat this condition, the patient should be put to sleep on his back.
He should cut all the relaxed skin over the thick skin, then gather the folds, and if he wishes to sew first, he can sew three or four stitches through the relaxed skin and secure them. Then he cuts between the stitches.
Then treat it like any other wound until it heals, and the stitches will fall out.
Chapter LXXXVI.
On castration.
In our religion, castration is forbidden.
Therefore, I have refrained from mentioning it in this book, but I have included it for two reasons: one, so that physicians are aware of it if asked and can offer a remedy to those who encounter it; the second is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
As with lambs, goats, cats, and similar animals, I say that castration can be performed in two ways: by pressing or by cutting and severing. In the case of pressing, we make the animal sit in hot water until its female organs relax, soften, and hang down.
Then, you should massage it with your hand until it softens and becomes unnoticeable upon touch. For castration by cutting, you must hold the animal and, using your left hand, grip the scrotum, then tie the testicles off and make a single cut on each testicle.
Once the testicles are exposed, cut them after having removed the outer covering, leaving only the thin membrane surrounding the vessels intact. This method of castration is superior to that by pressing.
Because pressing might leave some of the female organs intact, causing the animal to desire copulation, then you should treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In the treatment of hermaphroditism.
In men, hermaphroditism appears in two types: one where it manifests as a space or an opening between the testicles, resembling the vulva of a woman, and sometimes there is hair growth and urine may flow from this opening in the scrotum.
In women, there is one type, where it appears above the vulva in the groin, resembling a small penis extending outside, like the male genitalia, and both are female in nature. Treatment for all three types.
For both types of men and the single type of woman, the excess flesh should be cut off to remove its effects, then treated like any other wound until healing occurs. However, for the second type of man from whom urine flows through the scrotum, there is no operation possible, and it does not heal on its own.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On the amputation of the clitoris and the flesh protruding from the vagina of women.
The clitoris may grow beyond the normal size, becoming distorted and ugly, and in some women it can become so enlarged that it resembles the male organ, leading to sexual activity.
It is necessary to hold the clitoris with your hand or a forceps and cut it, without exceeding in cutting, especially at the depth of its base, lest there be bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical treatment until it heals. As for the flesh that grows, it is flesh that grows inside the womb, filling it.
And it may protrude outward, similar to a toe. Therefore, some early scholars call it the "clitoris disease," and you should cut it as you cut the clitoris, treating it with surgical care until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On the treatment of epiploic hernia.
Epiploic hernia is when a woman's vagina is not perforated or the opening is very small, either naturally born that way or from an accidental cause. The accidental cause may be due to a surplus of flesh or other conditions.
It can be a thin or thick peritoneum, located either deep within the uterus, or along its sides, or at the top or bottom, preventing intercourse, conception, and childbirth. It may also halt menstruation. This is determined by an experienced midwife's examination.
If the obstruction is visible, examine it with your fingers or a speculum. If it is an obstructing perineum membrane, close to the labia, quickly make incisions and place your thumbs on both hands.
For a woman lying on her back, spread her legs and stretch the labia to puncture the thin perineum membrane, allowing the obstruction to open. Then take a woolen cloth, soak it in oil, and apply it to the area. Continue sexual intercourse with the woman daily to prevent the opening from sealing again.
If the perineum membrane is thick and tough, use a broad scalpel similar to a palm leaf to cut it. If the obstruction is from grown tissue, use pincers to grasp and cut it. Have at hand medications to stop bleeding without causing pain, such as fennel, hyssop, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube to prevent the wound from closing quickly. Hold it for several days and apply a dry linen string as a dressing, treating the area with all appropriate remedies to promote healing. If another meat-like growth appears in the womb, cut it following the same method.
Unless it is a benign tumor, a cancerous growth in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red sores that occur in the female genital area.
As for hemorrhoids, they are an inflammation of the veins' openings such that they bleed constantly, and if they present over time, they become warts. We have mentioned in detail their types, symptoms, and here we mention them.
What is curable and what is not: If hemorrhoids and warts are located deeply within the uterus and do not cause sensation, they should not be treated with iron. However, those that are in the uterine opening and cause a sensation are the ones to be treated.
A woman should enter a cold house, then use a scalpel or rough cloth to remove the warts, cutting them back to their roots. Then, she should apply something that causes bleeding from one of the cut ends without causing pain.
Like turpentine, turmeric, gum, and similar substances, then raise her legs against a wall for a while, dip them in cold water. If the bleeding persists, sit her in a mixture of sumac, pomegranate peel, and galgal, then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
If the blood stops, bind it on her back. Otherwise, fasten the ribs and breasts without a specific condition. Then take a piece of wool and immerse it in a mixture of pomegranate seeds, or date palm juice, or sumac branches with a drink made from gall. Apply it to the wound.
If the tumor subsides, treat the area with a ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of hair, rough to the sight, so you should cut what is visible from it, just as you would with warts, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter LXXIV.
On the fallopian tube that appears in the uterus.
It may appear in the uterus with various types of tumors, such as cancer, fibrosis, ulcers, abscesses, erysipelas, fistulas, hemorrhoids, cracks, warts, and hot tumors. All these conditions and their types have been described in detail in the previous sections.
In this article, we should mention the hot tumor that appears in the uterus if it is one of the tumors that persist for a long time, how its fallopian tube is lined with iron. You should examine it; if the pain of the tumor is acute at the beginning with palpitations, inflammation, and fever.
If it is red and the sensation persists, do not hurry to bind it. Treat it with what aids maturation. Once these symptoms subside, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean back.
Bring her legs together towards the lower abdomen, spread her thighs, and place her arms under her knees, binding them with a suitable bandage.
The midwife should then sit on the right side and use the instrument to dilate the cervix, whose image is depicted later. When using this instrument, one must assess the depth of the woman's uterus to avoid inserting more than necessary.
If the instrument extends beyond the depth, it may harm the patient. In this case, padding should be placed on the cervix to prevent further intrusion. The screw within the instrument should be turned from the upper side.
As you hold the instrument, the server turns the screw to dilate the cervix. If an effusion appears and feels soft when touched, it should be incised at its base with a broad blade once the discharge has ceased.
A soft plug, immersed in rose fat or green oil with some constriction, should be inserted into the wound. The plug protrudes from the cervical crack and is covered with pure wool soaked in boiling water mixed with bread dough.
Then it is treated after two days with the ointment that is suitable for it until it heals.
The womb and the wound may be washed by infusing water and honey, then water in which the root of fennel or long anise has been boiled, and finally return to the ointment, if the abscess is hidden internally within the womb.
One should abstain from treating it with iron, but rather treat it as we have mentioned in the categorization.
Chapter LXXV.
In instructing midwives on how to treat live fetuses that have emerged in an abnormal form.
The midwife should first know the signs of normal childbirth, which include when the woman feels a need to push downwards and desires fresh air, and finds the labor process easier despite postnatal conditions.
The speedy delivery of the fetus indicates a normal birth, where it emerges with its head first, and the placenta either accompanies it or is attached to the umbilical cord. If these signs are observed, the midwife should gently press on the mother's abdomen to facilitate a swift delivery.
If the foetus descends head first, the placenta follows, and this is a good sign. Any other presentation is abnormal and to be condemned, as the fetus may emerge with its legs first, followed by its hands, before its head and legs.
If it extends one hand or leg, or if its head and hand emerge first, or if it curls up or turns over on its back, or assumes any other such abnormal position, the midwife must be skilled and delicate in dealing with all these situations and avoid any mistakes.
I will describe each shape and the method to recognize and manage it, if the fetus emerges head first in a natural position but the woman experiences difficulty and her strength weakens, I recommend seating her on a chair while other women support her.
Moisturize the mother's womb with cooked fennel and wet oils, then the midwife inserts a small knife between her fingers, cuts the placenta, or uses her fingernail to make a slit, allowing the moisture within to flow out, and press on the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If the fetus does not descend, the midwife should apply a mixture of fennel saliva and oil of syrig (or sherbet) to the mother, then instruct her to sneeze gently while holding her nose and mouth closed. This is said to prompt the fetus's descent. If the hands emerge first, they should be carefully guided back inside the womb, little by little.
If the baby does not come out, place the woman on a bed and raise her legs above, then shake the bed on the ground while she holds on to prevent falling. If the hands do not deliver the baby and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the remaining fetus.
If the baby is positioned with its legs first, tie the mother's hands with a cloth and gently pull them, and the baby should come out. If the baby comes out on its feet, you should raise it slightly and then turn it slowly to align it, before taking one of its legs and extending it gradually.
If they come out to the thighs, order her to squirm and blow on it with a quill, and it will come out. If it does not come out as described, turn the fetus slightly until it takes its natural form, and then it will come out smoothly. If all else fails.
Take some of the mucus from the nose, mucus from fennel, shark fat, and a diluted resin, grind them all together in a mortar, then apply it to the woman's vagina and lower abdomen, and sit her in warm water until the vulva is hydrated.
If you see that her waters have broken, make a pocket from a raw date and have her carry it. If she holds the pocket for an hour, sit her on a chair, then blow on her and cover her mouth and nose, gently press her lower abdomen, and the baby should come out immediately, with its knees and hands first.
If the patient is in this position, the surgeon should slowly insert his hands and then have the woman lie on her stomach with her legs hanging down from a bed while she holds her hands. Then, press slightly above her abdomen. Then, remove the pillows under her legs so they are pointing downwards. If the baby does not come out, take both her legs and move them vigorously, then press gently above the perineum to help the baby ascend. Then, the midwife should insert her hand and carefully position the baby.
Instruct the woman to move and strain until the baby is born, with the baby's hand extended in opposition. If she cannot withdraw her hand, hold the woman in a supportive position as she stands or sits, or have her lie down if necessary.
Have her lie on her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then, use the birthing pad (made from the described materials) if labor has begun. If she feels a strong urge to push, seat her on a chair. Treat her hand and position the baby correctly. Encourage the woman to strain until the baby is born, ensuring it comes out naturally.
When the baby is born on its stomach with its hands extended, the midwife should take hold of the baby's hand and gently turn and position it correctly. Once positioned, apply the recommended oil and birthing paste as described.
Then make her move little by little. If she does so, sit her down on the chair and order her to lean to the right side. Then instruct her to turn over and cough, expelling the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends into the womb in this manner with the placenta, cut the placenta with your nail until it is free from moisture. If it attaches to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the umbilical cord to prevent suffocation and death. Then push the fetus back inside until it is in the proper position.
Instruct the woman to cough several times, and it will come out easily, the birth of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins often give birth to three or four, although this is rare. Five is something beyond nature; they do not live at all.
They are surrounded by a single placenta, and they separate with a membrane barrier between them attached to the umbilical cord of each. They can come out naturally and easily, like one fetus, or they can come out difficultly, as described.
If some of them are difficult at birth and turn to the forms we described, treat them as we described. The midwife should be gentle and do what she does with kindness, patience, and cunningness, using all means available to ensure safety.
The number of fetuses imagined in the womb and then aborted may be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten. It is established in my experience that a woman aborted seven, and another aborted fifteen, all of them having conceived multiple fetuses.
According to the most wise and knowing, all of this should be within the knowledge of a midwife. She may one day encounter such a situation and handle it as she should.
Chapter LXXVI
In the removal of a dead fetus.
If, after applying the treatments mentioned in the previous sections, the dead fetus does not exit and manual intervention is required, you should assess the patient. If the woman is physically strong and free from any concerns that could lead to damage, she should lie on her back on a bed.
Her head should be tilted down, her legs raised, and she should be supported from both sides or tied to the bed to prevent her body from moving when the fetus is being extracted.
Then, moisten the mouth of the womb with wet fats, saliva from fennel and dill, and flaxseed oil. The midwife should then rub her hand with these oils and saliva, insert her hand into the womb gently, and seek out a suitable place to insert the forceps used to extract the fetus.
If the fetus is positioned such that it is about to descend by its head, then hooks should be inserted into its eyes, or back, or mouth, or throat, or under its beard, or in the areas close to the ribs, or beneath the sternum.
If, however, it descends by its legs, then the area around the genitals and middle ribs is targeted. The surgeon should hold the hook with their right hand and wrap its fold between the fingers of their left hand, then insert the hand gently and embed a hook in one of these mentioned positions.
Until it reaches something hollow, then insert another hook in front of it, or a third if necessary, to ensure an equal pull without bias towards any side. Then extend it evenly, not just straight but also moving it to each side.
To facilitate its exit, as is done with a tooth when it is extracted, the surgeon should loosen the extension. If any part becomes stuck, the midwife should smear some fingers with grease and insert them to rotate what is stuck. If part of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other positions.
She should raise it slightly to do this until the fetus is completely delivered. If a hand emerges before others and cannot be pushed back due to compression, wrap it in cloth and then pull it until it comes out entirely, then cut the cloth.
Either at the wrist or the forearm, and so you should do on the other hand and feet, if the fetus' head is large and encounters pressure during delivery, or there is water collected in its head, then you should insert a sharp instrument between the fingers.
And you should make an incision with it to extract the water, or use the instrument called a forceps, which is illustrated along with other instruments in the following chapter.
Similarly, if the fetus has a large head, you should naturally make an incision in the skull or use forceps as we mentioned earlier, and then extract the bones with hooks. If the head emerges but is compressed at the collarbone, it should be incised until the moisture in the chest drains.
If the chest does not expand, and it is not possible for the fetus to emerge, then cut as much as you can. If it is located below the abdomen or has a hernia, you should press on it until the moisture drains.
If the fetus is in a position with its legs, it is easily pulled and aligned towards the cervix. If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, you should use a cloth wrapped around your hand to pull it, and then make an incision at the abdomen or chest until the moisture inside drains.
If all other members have been removed and the head is retained, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the cervix is open, she should insert her hand into the cervix and seek out the head, then draw it towards the mouth of the cervix with her fingers, after which she should insert a hook or two hooks and pull with them.
If the mouth of the womb is attached to a hot tumor, it should not be forced, but instead, wet, fatty substances should be applied, as well as medications, and sitting in relaxing water to soften and moisten it.
If the fetus is on its side and can be repositioned, use what we mentioned for a living fetus; if this is not possible, it should be cut and removed, ensuring no part of the placenta remains inside. Once you have completed your treatment, apply the mentioned remedies for hot tumors that appear in wombs.
If there is bleeding, she should immerse herself in a contracting water bath and use all the remedies. I have seen a woman who had become pregnant but the fetus died in her womb; then she became pregnant again with that same embryo.
Then, the other fetus also died, and after a long time, a tumor appeared in her womb, expanding until it opened and discharged pus. I was called to treat her, and after a long time of treatment, the wound did not heal, so I applied some strong absorptive ointments.
A bone exited from the site, and after some days, another bone emerged. I was amazed by this since the abdomen is a place without bones; I presumed it to be from the bones of a dead fetus, so I examined the wound and removed many bones from the head of the fetus.
I continued following this process until I removed many bones, and the woman was in good health and lived for a considerable time, during which a small amount of pus drained from the site. And I have only shared this rare case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for the skilled physician in their handiwork of treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
It includes diagrams of the instruments needed to remove the fetus.
A diagram of a spiral instrument used to open the cervix.
This instrument, which equals books in value, has two spirals on both sides of the handle; however, this spiral should be softer than the clamp and made either from ivory or delicate wood (balsa). The width of each handle should be approximately the thickness of two fingers.
The length of the two pieces, when measured towards a finger, is one and a half cubits, and in the middle of the two wooden planks, there are two projections of the same type of wood, with a length of half a cubit or slightly more, and a width of nearly two fingers or slightly more. These projections.
They are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you rotate the loops. An image of another such instrument, more delicate and lighter.
It is made of ebony or cypress wood in the form of claws, but at the end of each there are two projections, each about a cubit long and two fingers wide. If you wish to open the cervix using these.
Then, you should seat the woman on a bed with her legs relaxed and spread apart. Insert these projections into the cervix, pressing them between the woman's thighs while holding the instrument's end below her knees. Open your hands with the instrument as you would with claws, adjusting the level of opening as needed for the cervix. Until the midwife achieves what she desires, an image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients.
An image of the instrument that pushes the fetus.
An image of the hook used to extract the fetus's head.
The scissors resemble a saw with teeth at the tip, as you can see, and it can be made in an oblong shape like claws, as you observe. It has teeth like those of a saw, cutting and shaving thereby.
Image of a cannon:
Image of a fishing hook:
This hook has a slight thickness to prevent it from breaking when pulling the catch, image of a two-pronged hook.
Image of two broad scissors for cutting the catch:
These tools, the more diverse and readily available they are to the craftsman, the faster their work progresses and the higher their standing among people for their skill. Therefore, do not underestimate any tool; it may be needed in the future.
Chapter Seventy-Eight
In removing the placenta.
If the placenta becomes stuck after childbirth, instruct the patient to press against her abdomen and then sneeze while you cover her mouth and nose with your hand. If it dislodges in this manner, otherwise take a sharp object and carefully extract it.
Drill a hole in the cover and place therein opened herbs for the cervix, such as fennel, chamomile, dill, chamomile, nettle, sorrel, and centaury, all these or some of them, and immerse them in water then carry them over fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole in the cover, with the other end in the cervix.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then sneeze as mentioned; the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, the midwife should dip her left hand in Shiraj fat or camel spittle.
Then insert it into the vagina and examine the placenta. If it is attached, grab it and slowly stretch it until it comes out; if it is stuck deep inside the womb, insert the hand as described earlier, find the placenta, and gently pull it with caution.
In order not to cause the womb to drop upon strong pulling, but rather, it should be gently transferred to the sides, right and left. Then, gradually increase the amount of pulling; it will respond and release itself from adhesion. If the cervix is closed, the treatment has already been described through sneezing, the pot, and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that has been described, avoid violence when attempting to pull it again. Instead, tie the portion that has come out around the cervix, on the woman's thigh, and then apply a four-ingredient ointment; it will soften and relax it after a few days.
It resolves and exits, unless it becomes putrid, in which case a foul odor ascends to the stomach and head, harming the patient. Therefore, appropriate smoke should be used.
Therefore, some pioneers have tried smoke from craftsmanship and dried figs, an illustration of the apparatus with which a woman vaporizes herself during menstruation, retention of the placenta, and other such conditions.
It is made of lead resembling a funnel, or of copper, with the narrow end inserted into the vagina and the wide end over the fire, upon which incense is placed on the embers, held until that incense disappears, then replaced with another.
Chapter LXXIX.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids without perforation.
It may happen that many boys are born with hemorrhoids not perforated, but blocked by a thin membrane. Therefore, the midwife should puncture this membrane with her finger, otherwise, she should tie it off with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to touch the muscle.
Then, she should place a woolen pad soaked in a drink and oil on it, and treat it with ointments until it heals, or if she fears that it will get blocked, insert a small lead pipe into the opening for several days, removing it when the child needs to defecate.
The obstruction of the anus may also result from a healing scar or tumour, which should be incised and then treated with the remedies and plasters we have mentioned.
Chapter Eighty.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids occurring in the lower regions.
Hemorrhoids occurring in the lower regions is a complication and thickening that takes place near the anus from the outside or within one of the spaces, and the hemorrhoid may be single or multiple.
If this complication persists, it will open up and release a watery white discharge or thin pus. Some hemorrhoids may extend to the rectum or colon, and those that are not extended may be recognized by what is expelled from them during defecation, both in terms of feces and gas.
Sometimes worms may exit from them, and they can be hemorrhoids if they are in the space and extend to the bladder or penis, or even to the hip joint and the coccyx—in other words, any location where a hemorrhoid is known to have extended but is not open.
Insert your index finger into the anus and, using a thin needle of copper or iron, enter the hemorrhoid if it is not curved. If it is curved, insert a thin lead needle or a horsehair into it.
Until you feel the probe or a hair in your finger, if you do not feel it at all and nothing comes out of the hole, neither feces nor air nor worms, as we have said, know that it is non-perforated and hurry to treat it.
If the fistula is perforating to the bladder or urethra, its indication is the passage of urine through it and its inability to heal with medications. On the other hand, if it is perforating to the thigh joint or gluteal region, its sign is the arrival of the probe there.
If it does not have any curvature towards the bone, there is pain in a specific direction, and pus always comes out of it, and no treatment works and it does not heal with ointments, then there is no cure for these types of fistulas at all.
Treating them is a futile effort for those who attempt it without knowledge, and while the non-perforated and non-chronic fistulas can heal with iron, as I will describe and as I have experienced, place the patient on their back with your hands beneath their chest.
Raise the patient's legs and tilt their hips towards their stomach. Then, insert a copper or lead probe into the fistula if it has any curvature, until you feel where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the anus, insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel that the probe has penetrated all the way through your finger without you sensing any gap or separation between your finger and it, then be certain that it has successfully gone through. Do not exert further effort, as there is no cure for such a condition.
They have said that it heals in some people rarely, and the treatment that is hoped to be beneficial includes applying a hot, thin iron according to the size of the fistula, as mentioned before, and inserting it into the fistula until it reaches near the anus, then withdrawing it twice or three times.
Until you know that it has burned all the excess flesh that is attached, similar to a bird's feather tube, then treat it with a wet twist in butter, removing the burnt flesh, and finally treating it with sealing ointments, for if it heals, it is cured.
If the probe does not penetrate your finger located in the anus and there is a thick barrier of flesh or membrane between them, and you see the fistula on the skin surface afterwards, then make an incision at the beginning of the fistula. As you pass the probe through the fissure into the fistula, until you reach where the end of the probe stops, it is then withdrawn and the probe falls off. Then, clean away the excess flesh attached, similar to a bird's feather tube, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If blood prevails and prevents you from cutting those meats, the best thing to do is to burn or treat with a sharp medicine, because burning with fire combines two good qualities: it burns that excess flesh.
Cut the blood and dry the humors, then treat it with a wet twist of butter or powdered sulfur mixed with oil until the site pus forms and these burned meats come out in the pus, then treat the wound with healing ointments that promote the growth of hard flesh.
These are the medicines that have a constricting and drying effect, and if they adhere, healing is complete; and it does not come back. If the fistula has penetrated to the depth of the seat (anus) and is distant from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the seat and feel for its extent.
If you feel the probe and there is a membrane or flesh between it and you, and it is close to piercing, the work in it is only by hope and desire; that is, use one of three methods: either burn it as we said.
Or cut it until you reach its bottom to be able to insert the twist and treat from close, but do not overdo the cutting so as not to cut the muscle surrounding the anus, which may cause the patient to expel feces without intention; then treat it as we mentioned, for perhaps it will heal as we said.
Either you penetrate and pierce that veil after having incised it near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or with another sharp instrument, and then clean all the purulent flesh in the wound to where you can with careful exploration.
Then, close the entire wound, including the incision and the upper orifice, until it heals, leaving the fistula open inside the anus, which will be easier for the patient, and the fistula may remain in this state.
If you insert the probe into the fistula and it is on one side of the anus, towards the body surface with the skin and the ring of the anus, then take a probe with a pointed end, like a shoemaker's needle, in this way:
Insert a threaded line, consisting of five threads or so, and then introduce the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom. If it is perforating the edge of the anus from inside near the surface, then proceed as follows:
Then, pull the thread out of that opening by inserting your finger into the anus and extracting the end of the thread, gathering both ends together, and tightening them. Leave it for a day or two; whenever the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it firmly until the tissue between the thread ends is cut and falls off. Then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the opening of a fistula is not drainable, make it drainable in any way possible, but do not cut into the muscle to do so, then proceed as we have mentioned until healing occurs.
An illustration of the scalpel used to incise cysts shows the blade sharply curved on one side and blunter on the other, so as not to cut through unnecessary tissue.
Chapter LXXXI
In the treatment of hemorrhoids that bleed and their laceration, and the healing of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: those inside the anus, resembling red blowers or small and large grapes, from which blood always flows.
They may be singular or plural, and when they are outside the anus, they are rarely moist, releasing yellow water or a small amount of blood continuously, and they appear in the color of the skin.
For the treatment of hemorrhoids inside the anus, instruct the patient to defecate and clean themselves until the anus is exposed, so that you can see the hemorrhoids, and quickly attach them with pincers or grasp them with your fingernail, then cut them at their base. If they do not stick due to moisture and relaxation,
Remove it with a coarse cloth or a piece of reinforced dough, then pull it out with your fingers, cut it, and sprinkle some sharp particles on it after cutting to serve as a substitute for cauterization, or extract it as mentioned in the previous chapter on cauterization.
Then treat it with all other remedies until it heals, if the fistula does not respond to treatment, inject the patient with a solution that causes a slight burn, which will wash out the fistula and easily expel it when the patient moves. As for the warts that protrude from the anus, their removal is easy and simple.
Take it with your fingernail or hook it to a fishing line and cut it, then treat it as mentioned until it heals. If one dislikes cutting with iron, they should use a needle with a thin thread inserted into it.
Then pull the wart upwards and insert the needle into its base on the opposite side, wrap the thread ends underneath the needle while it is crossed, tighten the wart firmly, tie the thread, and remove the needle. Do this with all warts, leaving one untouched.
To drain any excess blood, place a cloth soaked in rose fat or asphalt on the fistula and leave it there, instructing the patient to rest. Then wait until the warts fall off. Once they do, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they heal.
Treatment of wounds: Often they result from dryness and blood stasis. If they persist without improvement despite treatment, one should remove the top layer with a surgical knife or fingernail to make it moist and eliminate the covering that prevents healing.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, repeat the process more intensely, causing bleeding and peeling. Then treat it again; it will heal.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
In the treatment of reverse and non-reverse nails, warts, and dry scabies.
A nail is a round knot on the skin's surface resembling a screw head, present throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and between the toes, causing pain while walking.
One should make a cut around the nail, grab it with a hook or pliers, and extract it from its root. Then treat it, as mentioned previously. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, round growth on the skin's surface.
It often appears on children's hands, and its treatment involves stretching and cutting or drilling the wart with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off. You can also burn it or treat it with a sharp medication as mentioned previously.
Both reversed and non-reversed warts can be removed with the instrument I have mentioned in the treatment of the ulcer. The ulcer is also a small, rough, thick protuberance on the surface of the body that goes deep into the tissue. If it gets cold, it feels similar to the sting of a mosquito.
It can be found on the entire body, most commonly on the hands. Its treatment involves taking a tube made from a duck or strong eagle feather and placing it over the ulcer so that the tube's edge surrounds it on all sides. Then, you rotate your hand with the tube to cut through the tissue around the ulcer.
It goes deep into the flesh and detaches the ulcer from its origin. If desired, you can use a copper or iron tube in the same manner as shown.
The tube's upper end should be smooth and slightly curved, allowing for easy handling and twisting with the fingers. After applying heat to the ulcer as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, proceed as follows.

Regarding the tools used for injecting treatments into rectal issues, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe can be made of silver, porcelain, copper, or iron, and with these tools, small and large ones can be created, depending on the users' needs. The syringes used in the treatment of young children, whose seats are narrow or painful, should be very delicate, resembling a large syringe.
Its upper end, where the syringe is attached, should be wide in the same manner, with a barrier to secure the attachment of the syringe as you can see. The lower end, which enters the seat, should be solid and very smooth on one side, with two holes on either side, and one hole on the other side.
The size of the hole should be suitable to the thickness of the rod, or slightly thicker, and the syringe, which is made from a bladder of an animal or sheep's small intestine, should have a diameter of one finger.
Make numerous holes as it coils, with a finger's thickness between each hole. Then, insert a thin thread, twisted into a loop of ten stitches or so, into these holes to secure the syringe, similar to a scroll. Once the medicine is placed inside, tighten the syringe's head between the two stones firmly. Then, use it to inject. Here is a diagram of the syringe and the hole:
To inject the medicine, fill the bladder or intestine with the medication while it is at a temperature comfortable for the patient. Be cautious not to make it too hot or too cold. Then, have the patient lie on their back and raise their legs above them.
And under him, a mat or cloth is placed, then the tip of the syringe is lubricated with grease or egg white or horse saliva or similar, and it is gently inserted into the anus. Then the assistant squeezes the syringe firmly with both hands until all its contents are released into the bowel.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs against the wall. If the medicine encourages him to evacuate, he should do so as much as possible. If he sleeps through the night, it is more beneficial. If it is used to treat diarrhea and its exit is hastened, the syringe should be repeated until recovery is achieved.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the anus, the syringe should be gentle and smooth, like those used to inject children, and here is a picture of a mild syringe with its skin tightened.
Chapter LXXXIV.
In the treatment of surgical wounds.
As I mentioned in the division concerning the treatment of burns, here I recall the treatment of surgical wounds with the hand and with drugs, to the fullest extent. I say that surgical procedures vary according to the nature of the wound and the location of the cut.
The things that are the cause of wounds are numerous, such as a blow from a stone or a cut from a sword or knife or a stab from a spear or arrow or similar objects.
And as for wounds according to their locations on the body, they are like a wound that occurs on the head or neck or chest or abdomen or liver and similar organs.
And I will describe the treatment of certain wounds to make them a measure and a rule for all other wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds especially, as the complex ones will be mentioned in the first section of the third chapter of this book.
I say that if there is a simple wound on the head, and it is not a broken bone, and it was caused by a blow from a stone or similar objects, and only the skin is pierced, but the wound is large and I fear that the patient may develop a feverish edema, then immediately incise it with a scalpel at the appropriate place. Do not delay this, and drain the blood from him to his strength, if there is no obstacle to incising, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is small, and let the incision be from the opposite side of the wounded area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinking, and heavy foods; if there is an obstacle to incising, let him reduce his food intake and avoid meat and drinks, and apply a cotton ball soaked in rose fat alone or with a drink that has constriction properties.
If the hot tumor is secure, then apply pressure to the wound if it is still fresh with its blood and has not been altered by the air, which I will describe in detail shortly. However, if the air has changed it, apply some ointment to it.
Until the pus is drained, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and was caused by a sword or similar sharp object, and its edges do not meet due to lack of sutures, then sew it up as I will describe in the section on abdominal wound surgery.
If the skin has exposed the bone, and it is hanging but can only be secured with a slight clamp, then cut it away and treat the wound with remedies that promote the growth of strong flesh in place of the skin, and instruct the patient to consume foods that are firm, such as heads, skulls, etc.
If a fungus develops in the skin and does not adhere to the bone, cut off the infected part and throw it away, then treat the wound. If there is an artery or vein that is bleeding and the blood flow cannot be stopped with medications, examine the artery.
If it becomes gangrenous and does not fall off, cut it off with a scalpel and bind it. If, in the case of small, simple wounds, the above remedies do not help and it is necessary to stop the bleeding, cauterize them, and the healing process will be easy and straightforward.
Before the air alters it, the recipe for the dust calls for one part resin, two parts frankincense, and three parts slaked or unslaked lime to be crushed, sieved, and filled into the wound, then tightly bound to ensure a good seal.
It hardens with blood, then secured from above with bandages, left intact as long as it does not swell. The treatment is effective until healing occurs; the lime alone can achieve this if resin and frankincense are unavailable.
It can also achieve this effect with just two components in many major surgeries if the application and binding are done skillfully, as long as the wounds remain fresh with blood. However, if the air has altered them, especially during the summer season, additional measures may be required.
Therefore, using this dust effectively does not imply merely applying some of the prepared ointments or a porridge made from barley flour with water and honey to promote pus formation; rather, it should be treated with all other remedies until healing occurs.
If a fracture occurs in the bone, even if it is minor, draw it out with splints, as mentioned in the treatment of skull fractures. In neck surgery, if the wound is in the neck, there is no difference in treatment from a simple head wound.
If a nerve in the neck has been cut, or an artery, as for a nerve, there is no remedy but to avoid treating it with strong constrictors such as iron, glass, and similar substances, as they will harm and spasm the nerve.
No cold applications should ever be placed on the wound, for the nerve's essence is cold, and it connects to the brain, which is the most noble of organs. Therefore, the treatments used should be gentle, such as a compress soaked in pure water, or oil infused with rose and nutmeg.
If the wound is also washed with pure water and other metallic stones in this manner, and moist plasters are applied, while for a large wound, stitching or binding it tightly with bandages should be used until healing occurs.
If the wound has a depth and a collection of pus has formed at its bottom, it should be drained in the lowest part; if an artery has been severed within the wound and blood is still flowing, it should be cut, tied off, or cauterized if necessary.
If the wound has severed some or all of the pharyngeal muscles and the jugulars are intact, sew together the edges of the skin over the pharynx, taking care not to touch the pharynx itself, then shape it back to its natural form and secure it tightly, leaving it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that cause contraction and drying until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, open it, if there are pieces of bone in it, extract them entirely or as much as possible, and if you cannot do so, leave it until the wound putrefies and heals, making its removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the described powder; if it becomes gangrenous and forms a bone abscess (nasal), treat it as mentioned in its corresponding section, under chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see that it has penetrated deeply, check if air emerges when the patient breathes; if so, know that it is a fatal wound. If there is no deep penetration and the wound is fresh with blood, do not immediately apply powder or tighten it, lest the blood become trapped in its depths.
It will then affect the heart, causing the patient's death. Apply a drawing ointment and dissolve it in water twice a day; if you do not have an ointment, use a worn-out cotton ball to absorb any discharge and place the patient's sleep on the wound.
To drain any accumulated fluid. If three days or more have passed since the wound was inflicted and the patient shows no signs of stiffness, poor circulation, or shortness of breath, and their overall condition is good, know that the wound is healing well and treat it with tourniquets and other remedies until it heals completely.
If it is not possible to drain the pus and the fistula persists, then know that it has become a chronic fistula, and treat it from its opening. If the illness affects the wound on the chest or back, treat it as previously mentioned with stitching.
If it is large or involves the joints, if it affects the bone and cuts away pieces of it, examine the wound and promptly remove those fragments if they are clean. If they are not clean, leave them until they heal.
If the wound becomes gangrenous, it will be easier to remove the dead tissue. As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment should follow the same guidelines as mentioned.
Chapter LXXV
On abdominal wounds, the emergence of the intestine and its stitching.
The abdominal wound may be large or small or moderate; a large one might expose the intestine or several intestines, making their reinsertion and stitching more difficult and complex.
A small wound can also be difficult to manage from another perspective, as prompt reinsertion of the intestine into its proper position is crucial. If delayed, the intestine may become swollen and thickened, making its reinsertion even more challenging. Therefore, a moderate-sized wound is preferable because it does not present the same difficulties in returning the intestine to its original place as these two types do.
Know that sewing the abdomen on four sides: The two general stitches are suitable for sewing the abdomen and for sewing all other body wounds, while the other two stitches are specific and apply to all wounds except the abdomen.
And I will describe them one by one with an explanation, so I say that if the wound is small and something from the intestine has emerged and it is difficult to return it, this is for one of two reasons: either because the hole is too small as we mentioned, or because the intestine was previously inflated by the cold air.
If this is the case, then you should warm it by immersing a sponge or cloth in lukewarm water alone, or one that has been boiled with cinnamon, calamus, and fennel, until the bloating dissolves.
It may also be achieved with a drink that contains a constrictor, which is better than water alone in dissolving the bloating. If you observe that the bloating has dissipated, moisten the intestine with water boiled with fenugreek or fennel, as it will facilitate its entry with ease.
If, after this treatment, it still cannot be returned, make a small cut in the hole using the tool used for cutting pipes (nassur), and the initial treatment is preferable if it can be done. However, he may be forced to make a cut only as a last resort and when all other methods have failed. This is a picture of the tool:
One side of the wound is curved and limited, while the other is unlimited. The thin edge is not as sharp as the scalpel but slightly concave. It is a tool similar to a small spear. If the wound expands and the intestine is exposed, it should be returned to its natural shape.
Its specific position is preferable if possible, but if the wound is wide and located in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs higher than their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, the head and chest should be raised above the lower part.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always aim to have the surgical area higher than the other side. This applies to both major and medium surgeries.
In minor surgeries, place the patient as you are able to, then have a helpful assistant hold the wound with both hands, gathering the edges together, and reveal them to the person doing the stitching one at a time.
This is the general method of stitching: take a needle or several needles suitable for the size of the wound, leave a gap at the edge of the wound equal to the thickness of a finger, and sew with one needle without threading it with a thread on both sides of the skin. With the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin, from within to penetrate them on that side, and having gathered together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, they become four incisions, then it is tightened with a doubled thread around the needle from both sides many times until the edges of the wound meet firmly.
Then it is left for the thickness of a finger, and another needle is inserted, then it is threaded as it was done with the first needle, continuing to do so with as many needles as needed until the whole wound is drained, and the needles should be placed between the thick and thin parts.
Because very thin needles quickly cut through meat, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin, they should therefore be placed halfway between the thin and thick parts, and the needle should not be inserted at the edge of the skin close to the wound.
So that the meat is not cut off quickly and the wound does not reopen before healing, nor should it be too tight with stitching, which might prevent the wound from healing. Then cut the ends of the needles to avoid harming the patient during sleep and make them secure with pieces of cotton fabric from each side to hold the needle ends.
And leave it until you know that the wound has healed. This method of stitching with needles is most effective for small wounds, as it may only require one, two, or a few more needles to sew them up.
The technique of stitching the second layer of the common approach consists of gathering all four margins, that is, both margins of the skin and both margins of the peritoneum, in a single pass with an needle containing a moderate length of spun thread suitable for its tenderness and thickness. Once these four margins have been passed through the needle, the needle returns from the same side it started.
The thread should be interlaced across the top of the wound, forming a stitch similar to that used for sealing containers, which tightens the load and spaces each stitch apart by the thickness of the small finger. This stitch is known to everyone.
By this stitch, a surgeon treated a man who had been cut with a knife, and the abdominal wound was more than an inch in size, with about two inches of the middle intestine protruding. The tear was located in the middle of the abdomen.
After 24 hours, the intestine was returned to its place inside the wound. The wound healed in about 15 days, and he was treated until he recovered fully and lived for many years, performing all his activities. The doctors had judged that he would never recover.
It is remarkable that I did not treat it with a salve, as I was in a place where there were no medicinal supplies. Instead, I placed old cotton on the wound twice a day and cared for its washing with honey water until it healed.
And as for one of the two types of suturing, I mention it based on Galen's words: to begin suturing with the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside, then, once the needle has penetrated through the skin and muscle in a straight line along the entire length of the abdomen.
I leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where the needle was inserted, and insert the needle from inside to outside on its other edge, passing through the margin of the rectus muscle, then, once inserted, pass it again through the same edge from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and insert the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, then, as you pass it through, also pass it through the rectus muscle's edge, until it completely penetrates into it.
Then, begin from the same side, following the line with the edge closest to the peritoneum on the other side, and remove the needle from the skin next to it, then return it through that same skin, along with the peritoneum's edge on the opposite side, in line with the rectus muscle.
Remove the needle from the skin on this side, and repeat this process several times, until you have sutured the entire surgical site, following the example provided. The characteristic of this suture is that it resembles the stitching of furriers on leather.
By sewing the peritoneum once on one side with the edge of the skin and leaving it open on the other side, allowing it to empty. The second type of stitching, specifically mentioned by Galen, is as follows.
It involves sewing it in a way similar to how some healers do, by bringing each part to its natural counterpart, attaching the edge of the peritoneum to the other, and the edges of the drains to their respective ends, as I have described.
The needle should be pushed into the edge of the drain, close to you on the outside, and then inserted solely into the inside. You leave the edges of the peritoneum, then turn the needle and withdraw it, going from the outside to the inside through both edges of the peritoneum, and also turn it back.
You then withdraw it from inside to outside through the other edge of the drain on the opposite side, and this type of stitching is better than the general, simple stitching that is mentioned, which is done with two needles. Galen said, 'One may use two needles for stitching the abdomen.' This involves using a single thread and beginning by pushing the needle from your side to the other, then using another needle from the opposite side, following the same stitching method as for the seams.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, stitching it is more difficult than other parts of the abdomen. As for treating the wound, its management is similar to other wounds, for if you succeed in achieving a fresh wound with its blood before air alters it, and you return the intestines to their place and stitch them tightly, then apply hot iron.
If the wound has been altered by air, apply some remedies that you prepare to promote discharge, loosen the stitches, and heal the peritoneum and omentum, then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals.
If you do not have access to remedies, apply aged catgut to the wound and change it twice a day as I have taught you until it heals. In most cases, if the wounds are simple, you will not need further treatment. However, if you fear that the wound might affect vital organs with pain.
You should immerse soft linen in a moderately warm oil or rose fat and apply it around the areas between the ribs and underarms. If pain or putrefaction is felt in the intestines, this often occurs; in such cases, inject a warm black astringent drink.
Especially if putrefaction has reached the intestines and become an open wound within the abdominal cavity; know that what was thick in the intestines heals more easily, while what was thin is harder to heal.
And as for the intestine known as the colon, it does not permit healing from surgery located in it at all, due to the abundance of its veins and their size, and the lightness of its tissue and its nearness to the nature of the nerve. If what emerged from the wound is still fresh, return it to its place, just as you would with the intestine.
If it has passed a period of time and it has turned green or black, then you should tighten it with a thread over the place where it turned black to prevent bleeding, for in the scar there are veins and arteries. Then cut off the tie below that.
Make the ends of the thread attached from below the surgery, outside of it, to make it easier for you to pull and remove it when the scar falls off and the wound becomes infected. Remember the wound that occurs in the intestine: if there is a small tear in the intestine.
It is possible that it will heal in some people, as I saw a man who had been pierced in the abdomen with a spear, and the wound was on the right side of his stomach. I treated the wound, but I did not expect it to heal completely, as it became a fistula through which feces and gas exited. I continued to tend to him until the wound healed and the scar formed. When I saw that the scar had healed, I was concerned that something bad might happen to the patient inside his body, but nothing bad happened to him from that at all, and he remained in the best of conditions. Correctly, he should eat, drink, have sexual relations, and enter the bath, and engage in his service as usual. Some experienced people have said that if a small wound appears in the intestines, it should be sutured accordingly.
And it is that one should take the larger ants, open their mouths, and place them on either side of the wound, then when they grasp and tighten their jaws, their heads will be cut off, but their bodies will adhere and not fall off, and another ant should be placed next to the first.
And one should continue to do this with several ants, as needed for the size of the wound, then apply it and sew up the wound; these ant heads will remain stuck in the intestines until they heal, without causing any harm to the patient, and even thin thread can be used to sew the intestines.
Which is to take a thread from the animal's intestines that is stuck to it, cut off the sticky part with an needle, tie a thin cotton thread to the end of it, and then insert that thread through the needle. And in it, the thread of the intestines is used to sew up the wound, then returned to the body cavity. This method of stitching using ants and intestines is a means to achieve hope and desire.
However, if the wound is large and wide, especially in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy or cure at all.
Chapter LXXVIII.
In the treatment of the common cold and nosebleed.
Know that every wound or lump that persists, grows old, and becomes a ulcer that does not heal and continuously produces pus, is called, in general, a fistula, and we call it a cold (or catarrh) when it occurs in any part of the body.
It is, in truth, a complex, solid, white mass without pain, with a hollow space like the cavity of bird feathers.
Some have therefore named it a feather, and it can sometimes be moist, continuously producing pus, and at times the moisture may cease. It can be abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
In the classification when discussing ulcers, it has been stated that every wound that does not heal and does not allow tissue regeneration may be due to one of nine reasons: either a lack of blood in the body, or its low quality, or because there is hard flesh inside or around the edges that prevents the growth of healthy tissue. Either the ulcer is deeply infected and filthy, or itself putrid with a foul-smelling substance, or due to poor quality material it produces, or because the treatment is unsuitable, or due to a plague in the town, or some other local factor.
Either the ulcer is deeply infected and filthy, or itself putrid with a foul-smelling substance, or due to poor quality material it produces, or because the treatment is unsuitable, or due to a plague in the town, or some other local factor. As demonstrated in the city of Saragossa, where the progression of diseases is hindered and the healing of tumors is delayed due to either a single bone or multiple bones, all these causes, symptoms, and treatments with drugs have been detailed in the previous section.
Here, I should introduce you to the treatment of fistulas and catarrhs through manual manipulation. Note that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body, ending either in great veins and arteries or in a nerve.
or to a peritoneum or intestine or bladder or rib or vertebrae of the spine or a joint of composite joints such as the hand and foot, and some end near a major organ and so on.
As for these fistulas with such characteristics, they are among the most difficult diseases to cure and require a great deal of effort and knowledge. If there are fistulas that have not reached the aforementioned places where treatment is possible, I urge and hope for a remedy.
And to gain this knowledge, take a probe of copper or iron. If the fistula runs straight, use it to examine it. If there is a curvature in the fistula, use a thin lead probe, as lead softens its shape.
It will slide easily when inserted, and bend towards the curvature. If the fistula has multiple openings and you cannot locate them all with a probe, inject moisture into one of the openings. The moisture will flow towards the other openings and drain.
Then, by all means, conduct an examination to determine if there is a bone or nerve, or if the fistula's base is distant or close, or if it is a single fistula with multiple openings. Observe all this within your ability through your investigation of the patient's condition and pain when you touch the area.
And similarly, regarding the signs and causes of tumors, if you observe all this with certainty, then proceed to treatment confidently, examining it to see if...
If the fistula appears close or in a healthy place, far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the locations mentioned, then cut the fistula as described above and remove the debris and rotten or excess flesh.
And what grows in its mouth, whether flesh or a papilloma, should be treated until it heals. If the fistula's base is distant and straight, you should cut it deeply as much as possible, then clean it of all rotten flesh.
Then use the clean catheters soaked in strong medications and insert them into the fistula's base, which you have located with iron, doing this multiple times until that sharp medication has eaten away all the rot remaining at the bottom of the fistula.
Then use the ointments that promote tissue regeneration until it heals. If it does not heal in this way, remove it as described previously. If the cause of the fistula is a bone and this is confirmed, cut it open as I have instructed you if there is no impediment.
If a vein, nerve, or principal member (as we have said) becomes exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackening in it, remove it until its corruption disappears, then treat it with what binds it until it heals, if it does not heal and pus continues as it was.
Therefore, know that you have not removed all corruption, so expose all of it once again and explore its removal and purification with all your effort, then force it (the tissue). If it heals, otherwise, be aware that this corruption is deep and remote from the initial corruption, so expose all of it once more.
Explore its removal and purification with all your effort. If the corrupt bone is a small one and you can pull it out, then use delicate hooks suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, explore their removal all at once and do not leave any behind. If something prevents you, such as a ligament, and cutting it poses no danger, then cut the ligaments and flesh to free the bones.
If you are unable to remove the bones at once, then apply something that prevents putrefaction to the wound and leave it for several days until the flesh around the bones becomes rotten along with the ligaments. Preserve the wound so as not to allow the cut you made during your work to heal.
Instead, if you are afraid of this, place a cotton ball soaked in powdered sulfur with oil or a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian paste or one of the green pastes. If these ligaments rot and the bones become loose, it will be easy to remove them and pull them out.
If it is a single large bone, such as the leg or thigh bone, and the corruption affects only its surface, then remove it thoroughly to eliminate that darkness and corruption. Afterward, close the wound. However, if the corrupted part is substantial and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, it must be cut away.
Cut it all away to where the corruption ends, and then treat it until it heals. I will tell you of a case that occurred to a man in his leg, which can serve as an example and aid to your treatment; this man was young.
Around thirty years of age, he experienced pain in his leg due to a movement inside the body, which caused materials to reach the leg and form a large lump that was not caused by something external. Over time, with the persistence of the pain and the mistakes of the doctors, the lump opened up.
Much pus and fluid drained from it, and it was poorly treated, causing the leg to become gangrenous with numerous openings exuding pus and body fluids. It was treated by a group of doctors for about two years, but there was no skilled surgeon among them.
Then I examined his leg, and the pus was draining from these openings in great quantities. The man's body had wasted away, and his skin had turned yellow. I inserted a probe into one of these openings, which reached the bone, so I examined all the openings.
I found them opening into each other on all sides of the leg, so I incised and cut open one of those openings, exposing some bone which was decayed, having been eaten away, blackened, putrefied, and perforated to such an extent that the perforation reached the brain. I then spread apart what had become exposed.
He removed the rotten bone, and I believe that there was no other damage to the bone than what I had cut out and spread apart. He then used compresses with healing drugs for a longer time, but it did not heal. Then he examined the bone again for a second time.
I found the decay attached to the bone, so I spread apart what had become exposed from that decay as well. I then attempted to force it together, but it did not heal or bind. I examined it again, and I kept cutting off pieces of the bone one by one, trying to make it heal, but even after cutting off about a palm-length of bone, it still would not bind.
He removed it with its brain, then used compresses with healing drugs, and it healed quickly. However, this repetition was necessary due to the patient's weakness, lack of endurance, and my fear of death, as excessive vomiting had previously caused a severe condition that only fully recovered.
Flesh grew in the place of the bone, and its condition improved in his body. His strength returned, and he regained control over his movements. No harm affected him while walking, and if a bone broke in any part of the body, it healed properly.
It is necessary to proceed as follows: take a bandage, tighten it at the end of the protruding bone, and order someone to pull it upwards, and make another bandage from thicker wool than the first.
Then bind it to the flesh beneath the bone, and extend its end downwards to draw the flesh down, while exposing the flesh in the area you wish to cut, so as not to harm the saw, and place a wooden block or board under the bone firmly.
For if you do not cut the rotten bone, the saw will not be able to cut it, and you should make the cut slightly above the area of rot, so as not to leave a cavity in the bone that would not be visible to the eye, and you might have to cut it again.
If the bone is rotten and not protruding, but connected to each other, with rot in the middle or in some of them, then expose the flesh from all sides, place a wooden block below, and cut it from the first side where the rot is.
Once you have finished cutting, cut from the other side, and make the cut slightly away from the rot as we mentioned. If the rot is in a joint, then cut the rotten joint itself and cut the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the rot affects the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but to remove it. If the rot is in a finger or toe joint, its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel away the rot as best you can, clean and remove it, however possible.
By what means can you achieve it, if a vessel or nerve does not impede you? Know that the saws and chisels for cutting these bones are many, according to the position, arrangement, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and softness of the bones. Therefore, for each type of work, you should prepare a tool suitable for that work.
And know that the work itself may indicate the type of tool you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of these arts, for he who is skilled in the craft and has witnessed various forms of illness. He may himself deduce what is suitable for each illness, and I will show you in the last part of this door several tools.
Make them examples to be emulated and a measuring stick to measure others with, if God wills, an image of a saw:

Chapter LXXVIII.
On the amputation of limbs and the separation of bones.
The limbs may decay either from a cause external or internal, and if you treat the corruption with drugs but the treatment is ineffective and you see the decay spreading in the member, nothing will stop it.
You should then cut off the limb at the point where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved from death or a great calamity greater than the loss of the member; and a sign that this is the case is when the member turns black as if it had been burned by fire.
Or it may turn black and the decay will spread to what is adjacent, taking over the body; so be swift in cutting it off. Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the bite of some creatures such as a sea scorpion, or a snake, or a spider, or the like.
If the corruption or bite is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger, and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand; similarly, if it has taken hold of the hand, cut it off at the wrist, and do not allow the corruption to spread further until it reaches your forearm.
If, however, the injury is in the arm, it should be amputated at the elbow joint itself; if the damage allows for it, and you consider it necessary, take it towards the shoulder, but do not ever cut off the shoulder, as this would cause the patient's death. Rather, use other treatments to the best of your ability.
Similarly, if the damage in the foot affects a finger, it should be amputated at one of the phalanges; if it involves the sole of the foot, cut off the entire foot, but if it reaches the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to leave it and let the patient succumb to death. The method of amputation or dismemberment consists in tying a ligature below the point where you intend to cut, and another ligature above that point.
The assistant should tie one ligature below and another above, then, using a broad scalpel, remove the flesh between the two ligatures, exposing it completely. Finally, cut or sever the tissue, ensuring to apply a piece of linen cloth from all sides.
To prevent the saw from striking the wrong place, causing additional pain and a hot swelling to the patient, if bleeding occurs during the operation, quickly stop or press on the site with some sharp flakes to stem the flow, then resume your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the injured member with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals, and I will tell you of an example that occurred to a man in his foot, this very occurrence that I describe to you, for there appeared on his foot a darkness with burning like fire.
This corruption was the first to occur in his finger, until it spread throughout his foot, and the man, upon seeing the corruption spread in the member with the intensity of pain and burning, amputated it at the joint, and he healed.
After a long time, the same corruption appeared in his index finger, so he came to me, and I treated it with the remedies I had on hand, after cleaning his body, but the corruption did not stop and spread to the other fingers.
Until the corruption spread to his hand, he called on me to amputate it, but I refused, hoping to stop that corruption and fearing for his life when cutting off his hand, as his strength was waning, and when he despaired of my help, he left for his hometown.
I was informed that he amputated his entire hand and healed, and I have related this story to serve as a help in the case of this disease and as a guide to be followed.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
In the treatment of abscesses and the method of injecting them with medicines.
If a tumor occurs in some fleshy organs and its duration is prolonged until it ruptures or opens, expelling everything within it, leaving the site empty as if it were a vessel.
The skin covering it is like a cloth that has become thin but has not yet decayed to the point of affecting a bone, nerve, or ligament; from here it deserves to be called an abscess rather than a fistula, except if its duration prolongs until the decay affects any of these members.
If it is then called a fistula or an ulcer, and its treatment involves cutting off all that skin completely, as it unravels, especially if it has become thin like a cloth and is confirmed to not adhere to the site due to its decay.
If the skin still adheres and has not yet reached that level of decay, but there is enough flesh, then treat it with injection; that is, examine the abscess. If it is large and the pus within it has a bad odor, inject Egyptian medicine into it.
Which is a mixture of vinegar, oil, honey, and cinnamon, equal parts, combined in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens like honey; then take as much as needed, dilute it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess, sealing its opening and leaving the medicine inside for two hours.
Then, remove it with the era (potter's clay); do this for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul odor disappears. If this remedy is not available, you can use ashes of date palm wood or oak wood, mixing them with water.
Then, strain it and inject it until you are certain that the abscess has been washed out. If there is no chance of obtaining Egyptian medicine or ash water, inject a mixture of water and honey with a touch of powdered zingiber (ginger).
Or, you can inject honey and a drink mixed together, as honey purifies and washes, while the drink adheres to the abscess, especially if it contains residual astringent and drying properties. If you do this several times and are certain that the abscess is free from corruption, then inject what promotes tissue regeneration.
For example, take some palm ointment and mix it with rose oil and astringent drink, or inject it with other medications and ointments whose properties have been proven in the article on ointments. If the opening of the abscess is narrow and cannot accommodate the syringe, then...
Gradually widen it with iron or insert a clean string soaked in Egyptian ointment or syrupon ointment to make it larger. If the opening is also wide, sew its edges together and leave enough space for the syringe to enter without excess.
If the mouth through which pus flows is elevated, make an incision in the lowest part to allow the pus to flow downward, for if pus accumulates in the depths of a wound, it prevents tissue regeneration.
If it is not possible to make an incision in the depth of the wound towards the bottom as desired, then mold the tissue so that the pus can flow easily from it, according to what you find suitable, and ensure that no pus accumulates there at all.
As for the protective medications that are applied to a wound from the outside, and how they should be applied, take one of the protective ointments suitable for the condition you wish to treat, and spread it over a cotton cloth, enough to cover the entire wound. Then, using scissors, make a hole in front of the wound's opening, slightly wider than the wound itself. Next, apply a soft ointment to another cotton cloth, cut to the size of the hole, and place it over the wound, ensuring it is not too close to the wound's opening. Leave the large cloth untouched until the pus has drained, then remove it.
For several days, the ointment on the wound's opening should be removed at regular intervals to allow any accumulated pus to drain and to assess the nature of the discharge: whether it is excessive or minimal, mature or immature.
And moreover, examine the site of the abscess itself to see if its owner feels pain there or not, and if there is a swelling or not. If your treatment continues in this way and you observe that the material that comes out is meager at the mouth of the abscess.
If you know that the abscess has adhered or is about to adhere, then dissolve it on the morrow or on the third day. And when you have opened the wound, replace the bandage with a new one and renew the ointment. If after a long time thin pus comes out from the abscess, do not despair of its healing.
Healing is near, because among people there are those who slow the growth of flesh in their wounds, and others do the opposite. If after many days pus that is not yet mature comes out from the abscess, know that the abscess has not adhered. If it takes time for the abscess to adhere.
If the process takes a long time, increase the drying medicines, and let them be in a state of being moist in composition and dry in power, such as the palm butter if it is increased with more of the collicular (a traditional medicinal ingredient). Among what is most effective for treatment is to use the palm butter.
Apply a mixture of rose oil and an ancient, moderate-strength drink, then knead it and use it. If rose butter is not available, you can use honey after boiling it until it thickens, or mix powdered asafoetida, galangal, and cinnamon and sprinkle the powder over the honey while it's on the fire. Then, apply it to a cloth and secure it over the wound, or coat it with honey that has been cooked until it thickens, then sprinkle medications on top and place the cloth over it and secure it.
In such cases, long ziraund, the root of the blue lily, and powdered calum (cress) or centaury (centaurea) can be used alone or mixed, ground and sifted, then sprinkled over the honey described earlier and applied; however, if after a prolonged period the wound does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption within.
It has affected bones, or other hard nerves or ligaments, and its treatment is the same as for fistulas, as mentioned earlier.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
In the treatment of ganglions, crushed nails, amputation of the surplus toe, and incising the healing of the fingers.
A ganglion is a mass of flesh that grows under the nail of the thumb or any other finger, and sometimes in other parts of the fingers. If its condition persists and treatment is neglected, it becomes swollen and hot.
Or it decays and putrefies until it consumes the nail root, and perhaps all of it, and the decay may reach the bone, emitting a foul odor, becoming broad at the tip, and its color blackened; if you treat it as mentioned in the previous sections and your treatment is ineffective.
All the debris that grows from under the nail should be cut with iron, and then the wound should be cauterized. Indeed, cauterization is very beneficial in this case, especially if the bone is intact and so is the nail.
And the angle of the nail, which pierces the flesh, should be filed and raised slightly, and a thin rod should be placed under this angle to gently lift and cut off the piercing flesh.
You should apply burning, corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh until it all disappears, and then treat it with ointments for healing. However, if corruption has affected the bone, you must cut out and remove that bone, for it will not heal as long as there is a corrupt bone left.
If you observe decay and corruption spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the phalanges as previously mentioned, and then treat it until it heals. If the nail is injured or bruised and causes severe pain, you should first drain the blood or pus.
Then, using a sharp scalpel, make an oblique cut in the nail from top to bottom, taking care not to reach the flesh beneath. This will cause severe pain for the patient and may lead to excess tissue growth at the site. Treat the area with remedies to relieve pain.
And as for the surplus finger that is generated in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy or perhaps have bones in it, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow from the base of one of the fingers' joints.
Or if it grows from some of the phalanges of the finger, and those that grow in some phalanges do not move, and those that grow at the joint of the finger may move, then what is entirely fleshy should be cut off easily by cutting it at its base with a wide knife.
As for the one whose growth is at the joint's base, its treatment is difficult, so it should not be cut off; but for the one that grows in the finger at a phalange, the flesh around it should first be cut away circularly, and then the bone can be split using one of those saws suitable for this purpose.
Then treat it until it heals; and the adhesion that occurs between fingers, often occurring naturally or due to a wound or fire burn, etc., should be incised in order to break this adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural state, then place between them a thread or a small hole soaked in rose fat so that it does not adhere quickly and separate, or use a thin lead plate between them until the wound heals as it should.
And if the fusion of some fingers with the hand is exposed, then that fusion should be cut according to what is suitable and proper for the shape of the member.
Chapter Ninety
In the cutting of veins.
Veins are twisted, thick vessels filled with a dark, viscous fluid, most commonly found in the legs, particularly in the forks of the legs, the ankles, and the feet. Therefore, it is first necessary to use vigorous rubbing of the body to dislodge the black mud.
Then, the vein (basilisk) should be cut, and its treatment with iron consists of two methods: one is to open it and drain the black blood, and the other is to scrape it off completely. In the first method, the leg should be soaked in hot water first.
Until the thick, cloudy blood is dissolved, then the patient's leg should be tightly bandaged from above the thigh to below the knee, and the vein should be cut in one, two, or three wide incisions.
Then, the black blood should be drained by hand from below the leg upwards and from above downwards, until you have removed what you consider sufficient or what the patient's strength allows. Then it should be tied off, and he should be instructed to avoid foods that promote the formation of black bile. This process should be repeated with vomiting and fainting.
When the veins are filled and this causes harm to the patient, if his leg has a lot of hair, it should be shaved, then immersed in hot water, and the leg should be washed with hot water until it turns red and sweats or undergoes intense physical exercise.
If a bath is not available to heat the affected area, then the skin should be split lengthwise over the sweat gland, either at the knee or below the ankle, using a sharp instrument, and the sweat gland should be removed from each side until it becomes visible to the touch.
When it appears, you will see it as a dark red color, and if you remove the skin, it resembles a tendon. Then, insert a smooth, blunt hook underneath until it rises and comes out of the skin. Hang it on this hook, and make another cut nearby, about the length of three fingers.
Then, remove the skin from the sweat gland until it is exposed, and proceed to raise it with the hook as before, hanging it on another hook. Then, make another cut or multiple cuts if needed.
Then, pull and cut it at the end of the first cut near the ankle, then pull and remove it from the second cut until it emerges from the third cut. Finally, cut it off at the third cut, which is above all the others.
If the traction and the slip do not work, introduce a needle with strong doubled thread, tie it, pull it, and insert under it a trocar, then twist your hand in all directions until it comes out. Be careful; if it breaks, it will be very difficult to extract.
Once the foreign body is removed, apply a poultice of soaked linen in rosewater or oil to the wound and treat it until healing occurs. If the object is twisted and has curves, it must be turned in all directions.
If it is not straight, as we mentioned, it should be cut at each curve and twist, then hung on pegs until completely removed. Be careful when cutting it; do not cut any vessels or cause a wound, as it will make extraction difficult.
Image of the method to extract a twisted foreign body:
Image of the blind hook:
It should not have a bend like other hooks, and its tip should not be sharp to avoid damaging vessels; instead, it must be thick and flexible. If it is too thin, it will easily cut the vessels due to its sharpness.
Chapter Ninety-One.
On the Sweat Gland of the Body.
This sweat is generated in the legs in hot countries such as Hijaz and Arab lands, and in arid, impoverished regions with little vegetation, and possibly in other parts of the body besides the legs. It is also produced due to fermentation occurring beneath the skin.
Similarly, it occurs within the bodies of living creatures and worms, requiring scraping and the removal of worms that develop between the skin and flesh. The onset of this sweat is indicated by a severe itching in the leg, followed by a tingling sensation, after which perspiration begins to exit from the site of the itching.
It is as if it were a root or an animal part, so when a portion appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead, weighing between one and two dirhams, and tied off. The lead is then left hanging from the leg.
Therefore, whenever something emerges from it towards the outside, wrap it in lead and tie it off. If it persists for a long time, cut some of it but do not remove it from its origin before all of it has emerged, as cutting it too early may cause it to retract and enter the flesh, leading to swelling, putrefaction, and a bad ulcer at the site.
Therefore, it should be managed and cut little by little until it exits completely from the body, without leaving any trace. In some people, this vein may be as long as five or ten fingers.
I have heard that in one case, it reached twenty fingers' length for a man. If it disconnects during treatment, insert a rod into its opening and wrap it tightly with the body until everything inside is exhausted, and try to heal the site with drugs for several days.
Then treat it with tumor treatment, especially if it appears in a joint or in the foot, where it has numerous branches, and each branch should be treated as we mentioned in the division and as previously stated.
Chapter 92
In the incision on the worm that develops under the skin, known as cow disease.
This disease is called "cow disease" in some of our countries, as it often affects cattle, a small worm that develops between the skin and meat, and moves throughout the body, rising and falling.
It is perceptive to the touch when it moves from one part of the body to another until it breaches through the skin, forming a sore from the putrefaction of certain humors, as occurs with worms and snakes, and rashes on the stomach.
And it is expected that its harm comes from the fact that if it spreads in the body and rises to the head, reaching the eye, it may open and come out, thereby destroying the eye. This occurs frequently. If one wishes to treat and remove it, it can only be done when it has spread and become apparent.
One should tighten the skin above and below it with strong bands, then make an incision and extract it. If it has become embedded in the flesh and cannot be found, one should apply heat from a fire to burn it. The greatest harm it can cause is to the eye, as we have mentioned.
If it is seen to have moved to the head, near the eye, tighten the skin under the forehead firmly, then make an incision and extract it. The patient should purify their body with purgative medicines that eliminate bad, stagnant humors, and be cautious of foods that cause fermentation.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
On the incision for the condition known as 'nafar'.
The condition known as 'nafar' in our land is a pain that appears in certain members and then transfers from one member to another, which I have observed as I describe.
I was called to a sick woman in a certain desert. She exposed her arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the vein of the forearm. After an hour, I observed that the swelling was moving towards the elbow with great speed, similar to mercury.
If the pain moves from one place to another, it disappears from the original location and settles in the elbow, then after an hour, it spreads throughout the body, reaching the other arm. She told me that her whole body was turning as she observed.
I was amazed by the speed at which it moved from one part of the body to another, and I had never previously seen this disease in such a way with such rapidity, except for having observed a group of people experiencing pain that shifted from one part of their bodies to another.
I initially thought that the reason for this was that the woman was from a desert region, with dry bodies and visible veins, which made the moving sensation more perceptible. This explanation would not apply to those in comfort, whose bodies are moist and have hidden veins.
If one wishes to treat it when the patient feels pain, and the swelling appears as we described, apply pressure above and below it with haste, make an incision, and drain the accumulated fluid, then bandage the area.
If you cannot see the condition, treat it by shaking the body and expelling the winds, such as with powder, or drops, or similar remedies.
Chapter Ninety-Four
In removing arrows.
Arrows may vary according to their types and the positions they occupy in the body. As for their differences by type, there are large and small arrows, hollow and solid glass arrows, and those with three or four angles.
Some have tongues, others have fragments, and according to the organs they enter into, they fall into two categories: either they are in the main hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestine, bladder, and similar ones. If an arrow enters one of these organs and the signs of death that I am describing to you appear, it is necessary to avoid removing that arrow; for in most cases, death will ensue. And if the arrow does not show any of these evil signs and has not become embedded in the organ, remove it and treat the wound. As for the signs of the brain if an arrow penetrates it and breaks the bone and injures the peritoneum covering the brain, it will cause severe headache, confusion, and dizziness.
And if the arrow does not show any of these evil signs and has not become embedded in the organ, remove it and treat the wound. As for the signs of the brain if an arrow penetrates it and breaks the bone and injures the peritoneum covering the brain, it will cause severe headache, confusion, and dizziness. Redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, spasms, mental confusion, sudden vomiting, and possibly blood from the nostrils or ears. Speech may be cut off, voice lost, and white, mucus-like discharge emanates from the wound site.
If these signs appear, refrain from further treatment and arrow extraction if it has not already left the body. As for the signs of an arrow that has struck the heart, close to the left breast, and is felt as though it has become embedded in a solid object rather than something hollow.
The arrow's movement may resemble a pulse, and black blood issues from the wound, followed by cold limbs, cold sweat, and fainting. Know that death is inevitable. If the arrow wounds the lung, frothy blood will exit from the wound.
The vessels around the neck swell, the patient's skin changes color, they breathe heavily, and seek cold air. If the arrow has pierced the pleura (the membrane surrounding the lungs), it is close to the small ribs, causing immense breathlessness and pain.
The patient sighs, and all the muscles around their shoulders tighten. If the arrow has struck the liver, intense pain follows, and bright red blood issues from the wound. If it has hit the stomach, undigested food may exit from the wound.
And his command is clear. If the arrow enters the abdomen and becomes embedded there, or if something from the feces emerges from the wound, or if the intestines are perforated, then there is no hope for treatment or for extracting the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and causes urine to emerge, then it is a matter that requires immediate attention.
A visible protrusion from the wound, accompanied by severe pain, indicates a fatal outcome. However, most other organs, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, back, ribcage, thigh, and leg, among others, can often recover.
When the arrow does not strike a blood vessel or nerve and is not poisoned, I will share with you some observations on these arrows to guide your treatment. For example, consider a case where an arrow struck a man in the eye socket at the base of the nose.
He removed the arrow from the opposite side beneath the earlobe, and the patient recovered without any harm to his eye. I also extracted another arrow that had struck a Jew in the eyelid below the lower lashes; the arrow was partially withdrawn and only its small tip remained embedded in the wood.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, made of smooth iron square-tipped without barbs. The Jew recovered without any eye complications. I also removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian; it was an Arab-made arrow.
He who has two ears and between them a wound had penetrated, which had sunk into his ring, I treated it gently until I extracted it, and the Christian was saved. I also removed another arrow from a man who had been wounded in the stomach; we thought he would die from it.
After he had been thus for about thirty days, without any change in his condition, I made an incision over the arrow and treated it, and he was cured and did not suffer any further complications. I also saw a man who had been wounded by an arrow in his back; the wound healed over it.
After seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh. I also saw a woman who had been wounded in the stomach by an arrow; the wound healed over it, and the arrow remained without causing any change in her condition or hindering her from performing her natural actions.
I also saw another man who had been wounded in the face by an arrow; the wound healed, and he did not experience much pain. Many similar cases existed. I removed an arrow from a commander of the sultan that had penetrated his nose in the middle, slightly leaning to the right.
The arrow completely disappeared, and I was called to treat it three days after the injury. I found the wound caused by the arrow very narrow; using a thin probe, I explored it, feeling nothing, but he experienced a pinching and aching sensation under his right ear from the opening.
I have failed to expect that the point of the arrow would cause such a wound, so I dressed the area with a bandage containing an absorbent force to promote healing, hoping that the area would swell and show the mark of the arrow. I incised it, but there was no sign that the arrow had reached the area.
I persisted with the bandage for many days, but there was no improvement; the wound healed over, and the patient remained bedridden, hoping to expel the arrow. One day, he felt the arrow inside his nose and informed me of it. I then applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened and I probed it, I felt the fine point of the arrow attached to the wood. Then I continued to open the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared, staying with me for a period of time lasting about four months.
Then, when the wound widened and I was able to insert hooks into it, I pulled and moved them, but they would not come out. So I continued to manipulate them and devise ways to extract them using various tools until one day I managed to grasp them firmly with secure hooks, as illustrated in the final chapter of this book.
The doctors had judged that his nose cartilage would not heal, but I managed to fix it, and the wound healed completely, without causing him any further harm. I will tell you how I extracted some arrows, which serves as a comparison and proof for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts and details of this craft cannot be fully conveyed through description or contained within a single book. Rather, the skilled practitioner measures with a few words against many, applies what is present to what is absent, and infers a new work and tool at unforeseen crises.
If we delve into this craft, I say that arrows depart from the parts where they became lodged in two ways: either by being drawn from the place they entered, or from the opposite direction. They exit as they entered.
Either the arrow protrudes from a feverish part and can be drawn out, or if it does not come out on its own, you should leave it for days until the flesh around it putrefies, making it easier to draw and remove, especially if it becomes lodged in a bone.
If it does not come out, leave it for additional days and repeatedly attempt to draw and move it daily; it will eventually exit. If it still refuses to come out after several days, you should drill around the arrow in the same bone with a delicate drill on all sides until you create an opening, then draw and remove it.
If the arrow is lodged in the skull bone and deeply penetrates one of the brain's cavities, causing some of the symptoms you mentioned, refrain from drawing it out and allow the patient time to recover after several days.
In cases where the arrow must be drawn and removed, if it is deeply embedded and does not come out with pulling, use a drill around the arrow as described to you, then treat the site until healing occurs. However, if the arrow has withdrawn into a body part, treat accordingly. If sensation is absent, use a probe to locate it. If you feel it, draw it out with suitable instruments. If you cannot do so because the wound is too narrow or the arrow is deeply embedded and there are no bones, nerves, or blood vessels nearby.
Make an incision to widen the wound and insert your hand to grasp the arrow. If it has two ends embedded in the flesh, use every means possible to free the flesh from both sides. If you cannot free the flesh without breaking the bones or cutting them off, do so.
If you attempt to extract the arrow from any angle, use your hand with pliers in all directions until you free it. Be gentle to avoid breaking the arrow, which would make extraction more difficult. If you cannot do this within a reasonable time frame.
Leave it for several days until the flesh around it decays, then treat it again. If bleeding occurs, use the treatment methods mentioned in their respective sections and be careful not to cut any vessels, nerves or tendons, but employ other techniques instead.
In every way, you can extract the arrowhead with gentleness and caution, ensuring it is secured as described. When withdrawing the arrow, you should position the wound as it was when the arrow entered, for this is most beneficial.
If this cannot be done, use whatever shapes you can manage. As for the arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either a portion may have protruded outward or you might feel the end of the arrow close to the skin's surface.
Make a cut around it, as wide as the arrowhead, then pull. If it is stuck to a bone, twist your hand in a circular motion until the arrow impacts the bone and widens the opening, then draw it out.
If it does not come out after several days, treat it again. If the arrowhead remains inside, push it with a suitable instrument; if the head has fallen off but you still want to use force, insert a hollow tool into the arrow's shaft and push it through the tail of the arrowhead.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that fits inside the hollow, for this will facilitate its exit. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize the flesh in which the poison has taken hold, if possible, and then treat it as appropriate.
If the arrow pierces the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side and is close to what can be felt with a probe, make an incision and be careful not to cut any blood vessels or nerves, then remove it.
Then, sew the wound if necessary, and treat it until it heals. Figure showing the hooks used to extract arrows:
Their ends are shaped like a bird's beak, designed to grip the arrow or object firmly, and they can be made in various sizes—large, small, or medium—depending on the size of the arrow and the width of the wound.
Figure of the hollow cannon:
Figure of the solid cannon:
This is solid at the end, like a rod, to facilitate entering the hollow arrow and pushing it out.
Chapter Ninety-Five.
On the puncturing of veins.
The veins which are usually punctured in the body number thirty, of which sixteen are in the head; the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the sensitives; and the two arteries in the temples, visible, along with the two veins in the eye sockets, known as the lookers.
And the vein standing in the middle of the forehead, and the one at the tip of the nose, and the jugular veins in the neck, and the two veins on the upper lip inside the mouth, and the two veins on the lower lip, known as the 'gateways', and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins punctured in the arm and hand, there are five: one is the cephalic vein, on the lateral side, commonly called the 'vein of the head'; the akhol (or axillary) vein, the middle vein, composed of a branch from the basilic and another from the cephalic, commonly known as the 'body vein'.
The basilic, situated on the medial side, also called the 'underarm' vein; it is generally known as the 'stomach vein', or the 'arm tendon', which attaches to the ulna and appears clearly above the thumb, along with the annular vein.
It is the vein located between the ring finger and the middle finger, which has two branches. On the leg and foot, there are three veins: one beneath the kneecap on the outer side, another at the ankle on the inner side, and a third, the sciatic vein, at the back of the heel on the outer side.
On the other leg, there are three veins similar to those described earlier. The two veins behind the knees are beneficial for draining chronic discharge, migraines, tinea capitis (scalp ringworm), and chronic, poor-healing head wounds, and their extraction should be performed as I will describe.
This involves shaving the patient's head, rubbing a coarse cloth behind the ears at the locations of the veins, and then constricting the patient's neck with a turban until the veins appear in the lower regions behind the ears. You should feel their pulse with your finger, and mark them with ink at that point.
Then, take a scalpel with a thin blade (known as a dissection knife), insert it beneath the vein into the skin, and reach the bone. Lift your hand, still holding the vein and skin, and cut through them, making a clean amputation about the length of two closed fingers.
In this manner, you control the flow of blood as desired, then secure them with bandages and leave them to heal. As mentioned earlier in the book, you should know how to cut and tie off these vessels. The two arteries in the temples are beneficial for draining chronic migraines, persistent headaches, constant conjunctivitis, and severe, persistent discharge from the eyes.
And the method of incising them, as I describe to you, causes the patient to strain their neck with a cloth until the sweat glands become visible and their pulse can be felt beneath your finger. Then, using ink, mark the area, and lift the skin from the top of the gland to the side above with your index finger.
Then, insert the scalpel from below and lift the gland upwards, cutting it off as you did with the other two, allowing blood to flow as needed. Loosen the patient's neck, place your finger on the gland, and feel its pulse.
Then, apply a cotton ball and bandage, tightly securing it from above, and leave it until healing occurs. You have previously discussed the preparation, cutting, and binding of these materials at the beginning of the book. As for the incision of the forehead sweat gland, its benefit follows the incision of the temporal gland (cervical fascia) for chronic facial ailments such as tinea, ulcers, and erythema.
And the method of incising it, as I describe, chokes the patient's neck with a cloth until the sweat appears. Then take the tool called the 'fasal' (as illustrated below):
Place the resulting fork from the head of the fasal on the same gland and strike it from above with a comb or other tool, allowing blood to flow as desired. Loosen the patient's neck and secure it until healing occurs.
It may be opened with a wide scalpel, but the blade of the scalpel should not be as sharp as other scalpels. It must be slightly broader and flexible to avoid breaking it if it were too thin, as the bone is close by.
The veins located at the base of the eyes are beneficial in treating eye conditions such as scabies, redness, discharge, and facial diseases. To drain them, the patient should wrap their neck with a turban, and while standing behind them, use a small, slightly wide scalpel to make the cut, slightly elongated.
If the area has no flesh, and the scalpel is too thin, it may break. Then, you will have lost your blood and should place a cotton ball on it, securing it for one night before removing it. Drainage of the nasal veins is beneficial for high fever.
For severe headaches and facial conditions such as chronic red rashes on the nose, drain the affected area by first securing the patient's neck and then gripping their nose with your left hand while using a thin, long scalpel.
Insert the scalpel directly through the nose, between the nasal bones, maintaining an upright position as there are no sensory nerves there. The blood will flow freely, so carefully drain it and secure the wound for the night; it will heal quickly.
And as for the goiters, the benefit of their ligation is in cases of shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and black spots diseases that appear on the skin such as vitiligo, scabies, bad ulcers, and fistulas. The method of ligating them is to tie a band around the neck below them, with the surgeon standing on top of the patient.
Then the patient sits on a chair, and sweat is ligated along its length with a slightly wider ligature, draining an appropriate amount of blood or as needed, then repeat this for the other sweat gland, and then loosen the bandage.
The two sweat glands should be tied moderately to prevent the patient from choking, and left until the next day when the wound will heal. As for the glands of the jaw, ligation after the submaxillary gland is beneficial for tooth abscesses, gum decay, bad ulcers, splits in the lips, and poor wounds.
Which are found in the nose and around it, the method of ligating them is for the patient to sit before you with their neck tied with a turban, turn their lips aside, and observe the sweat glands, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, determining their blackness.
This is also because around them are thin, black blood vessels, cut them off completely, if it seems unclear to you, aim for cutting the largest and most prominent ones, and do the same for the glands in the lower lip.
And as for the veins beneath the tongue, it is beneficial to cut them after cutting the cerebral vein for the phlegmasia that occurs in the throat from tonsillitis and mouth diseases. The method of cutting them is to have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun, raise their tongue, and inspect under the tongue on one side and then the other, observing the color of the veins, which should be black.
Cut them, but be careful not to overdo it, as there are arteries beneath, and bleeding might occur from these. The three veins that are cut in the elbow are those usually cut in people, and they should be cut on both sides.
Either stitching with a wide, flat scalpel or an olive-shaped one to the wound, or making a cut with a sharp scalpel, which is called "nasl" (this is its figure): the figure of the wide, flat scalpel: [diagram follows].
It should be wide as you see, suitable for opening hollow veins filled with thick, cloudy blood, such as these: [diagram follows].
This scalpel is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for cutting small veins containing thin, yellowish blood. [Diagram follows].
This scalpel, suitable for making cuts, comes in various widths, from broad to thin, depending on the size and thickness of the veins. It can also be used as a guide for other tools, and it is well-known among craftsmen.
And as for the basilic vein, which is one of these three vessels, the benefit of its ligation is that it draws blood from ailments below the throat and neck, extending to the chest and abdomen. The ligator should be cautious when performing the procedure and stay alert, for if he goes too deep and cuts into an artery, it will be severed.
If bleeding occurs, the ligation should not be done with a surgical knife, but rather by making a slit with a hemostat. If the basilic vein is not clearly visible, it is best to avoid it and opt for another vessel or request some of its branches.
Or, if you ligate the arm vein, it is clear and should be slit with a hemostat as mentioned. If you wish to ligate it directly, you should, before tightening the arm, feel for the location to identify the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then, tie the arm and make a slanted slit in the vein with the hemostat as mentioned, ensuring the cut avoids the artery. When you tighten the ligature, if you feel a bulge at the marked spot with ink, that is an indication of the artery's dilation, so avoid it.
If, upon ligating the vein, you see the blood oozing out as if it were a child's urine and the blood is thin and bright red, know that it is arterial blood. In this case, quickly place your finger on it for an extended period, then remove it. If the bleeding stops, it often does so permanently. Tighten the arm.
Leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it, let it be secured with a bandage and do not move it for days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop or you are unable to find a remedy in time, then amputate the artery if it appears before you; its ends will contract and the blood will stop.
Take a slice of pistachio, split it open, and take one half, then secure it firmly over the sweat gland with tight bands until the next day. If the bleeding stops, otherwise treat it as mentioned earlier with the use of sharp particles to stop the bleeding, cutting off the blood flow is not difficult in most cases.
For a small wound that is well secured by the bandage on the arm, know this: the purpose of lancing the acromion sweat gland is to draw blood from the top of the head and the bottom of the body, as it is composed of a branch of basilic vein and a branch of cephalic vein, as we have said.
The person performing the lancing should be aware that if there is a nerve beneath, they should increase the depth of the cut with the scalpel and if they reach the nerve, it may cause numbness that is difficult to heal and may not heal at all. This nerve is often quite sensitive.
If it is barely noticeable in some people and thin, you should make your lance a slashing cut, avoiding the nerve as much as possible. If the sweat gland is between two nerves, slice it lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, lancing it draws blood from the head.
It is useful for eye diseases, and in this vein, especially if you wish to focus on it, make incisions with the olive scalpel or the broad basilical scalpel, for it is the safest of all veins, as it has no arteries or nerves beneath it.
However, when making the incision, you must avoid the muscle head with the scalpel and seek the soft place; it is no harm if it does not strike correctly in the first attempt, but it may swell in some people if not incised correctly at first attempt.
However, this swelling will not harm it in any way; regarding the method of incision and its symptoms and what should precede it in repairing it, you must first know that incision is only used to preserve health.
Whether it is used in diseases or to preserve health and sustain it, and to prevent the occurrence of diseases, the incision should be made in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the cephalic, basilic, or brachial, and it should be performed in early spring when signs of fullness appear.
The incision should be made on Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours have passed in the day; however, for those incisions used in diseases, there is no specific time limit, but they should be performed when needed, both day and night.
At every hour and in every age, it is not appropriate to perform circumcision on boys until they reach the age of fourteen, nor on old men who have passed sixty years, unless one intends to do so for a valid reason.
It is appropriate to clean the intestines with a gentle enema before circumcision if there is a large amount of feces trapped, so that it does not be drawn into the vessels during circumcision from the intestine's excess dirt that harms the vital organs, and one should not perform circumcision on someone who is intoxicated or drunk until sobriety returns.
One should also be cautious about performing circumcision after defecation, vomiting, urination, excessive sexual activity, exhaustion, exercise, insomnia, and fasting, or any other conditions that weaken the body or mind. Then, one should consider softening the humors (body fluids) before circumcision if the blood is thick.
using food, drinks, and medications if possible, then taking a bath, or engaging in some exercise to soften the blood, and performing circumcision in the middle of the day as we mentioned before, aiming to clear his mind from any negative psychological conditions that day.
such as worries, anger, fear, and all physical conditions such as excessive fatigue, sexual intercourse, and the like. Prepare his environment with things that people usually use for relaxation, such as perfumes, fragrances, entertainment, and so on, according to each person's ability.
Then the splint sits on a cushion that is higher than the one on which the patient lies, and then the splinterer extends his arm, and the splint is rubbed with the hand twice or thrice, and the bandage is tightened with the hook and twisted twice or thrice, but the tension should be moderate.
Because if the tension is either excessive or too loose, it prevents the flow of blood; then, after tightening, the patient should rub his hands together vigorously.
Until the veins swell and become visible, then the splint should wipe the blade with a little of old oil, especially, and place his left hand's index finger on the same vein below the desired site for fusing, slightly, so as not to trap the vein, thus avoiding the strike. Because some veins are like a tendon that traps when punctured, and others are filled with air. When the blade is placed on them, they sink beneath the blade, misleading the splint, and he does not open the vein, or if he opens it, the opening is narrow.
Therefore, the splint should be steady and patient in all these matters, then lower the blade; if the vein opens at that attempt, it is well. Otherwise, he should repeat the process below or above the same spot with haste, if it does not swell.
If there is swelling or severe pain in the patient, leave it for one or two days and do not tighten the bandage, as it may cause a hot lump. Do not bathe, then repeat the incision if desired. If the wound is sewn up and the opening is small and the blood flow is thin.
And if you fear that not enough blood will flow out, prepare the scalpel again in the same wound, applying it gently along its length, and increase the opening a little. Do this quickly before the area swells, for in many people, small openings can cause swelling.
If you see that it has swelled, do not repeat the incision at all, for it will be of no help. Apply something of oil acetic (vinegar) to it, as it facilitates blood flow and is better for this purpose than pure oil or any other fat.
Use vinegar in all your incisions of veins if the blood flow cannot be achieved, and this can also be done by certain remedies and herbs, when one or other is applied to the area, then the thick blood will thin and dissolve.
If a large lump occurs at the site of incision, this often happens, especially for those who have not had an incision before or if the opening in the vein is small. Act quickly: place a sponge soaked in warm salt water on the lump and apply pressure for an hour; it will dissolve.
It should be done after the blood has completely left the sweat itself or from another sweat, and if something of blackness or greenness remains in the place after several days, it will not harm, for if you wish, carry something of the patience and bitter solution on it.
Or something of fusing extract and similar, and often a tumor and nodule occur when puncturing the basilic vein, so place your hand on it, and if it feels compressed when you press on it, then that is a bad nodule, so be careful not to put anything we mentioned on it.
It may then bleed from an artery, but bandage it tightly to strengthen the place, and then treat it with all other remedies until it heals, and each person should drain blood according to their strength and what color predominates in the blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red, and if you see it as thick, send it out until it thins, and likewise, if it is sharp, allow it to lose its sharpness. It is also recommended for those who are full and strong and need to drain blood all at once.
It is to widen the sweat punctures and make the blade wide, and for the weak, the opposite is true, and it should be drained in stages with a narrow hole, and best for sweating punctures is a curved, spiraled cut, not stitching.
This type of lancing is free from bleeding and cutting a nerve, and it is the best method for lancing across and along [the wound]. For those who experience dizziness during lancing, they should be given something to eat before lancing, such as bread soaked in pomegranate juice or rue.
If it is heated and causes blood to flow three or four times, and if it has a cool temperament, then before lancing, one should take bread soaked in a drink made from mimosa or honey sweetened with spices, or in a pleasant-smelling drink infused with basil.
If dizziness occurs during lancing due to excessive blood loss, then one should drink meat broth and delicate basil-infused drinks, use gargling with myrrh, and employ all the remedies mentioned in the previous section under the heading "Dizziness.
For those experiencing vomiting, and for those who wish to relax their arm and allow further blood flow, those who have undergone lancing for excessive vomiting and have weak strength should let the blood flow slowly over several consecutive days, in accordance with their ability.
And if one wishes to relax their arm and allow further blood flow, and their body is strong, they should do so within seven to nine hours of the initial lancing. If one wishes to draw blood away from the direction it has naturally flowed, then they should repeat the process on the second or third day.
And as for him who has a great amount of blood in his body that is hot and intense, causing fever, it is necessary to let the blood out in one go, removing the excessive amount, until the opening widens after examining all the conditions for phlebotomy. And place your hand on his pulse while the blood is flowing, lest death occur in place of fainting, for this often happens if the phlebotomist is ignorant and there is a moment of distraction; and it is not appropriate if you intend to release the arm and allow the blood to flow again.
If the sweat gland's opening is closed and the blood is difficult to flow, do not poke or twist it strongly, for that is very harmful; rather, leave it until you can reopen it again, or use a scalpel to clear the hardened blood in the sweat gland opening.
Or hold something salty dissolved in water against it, or some distinguishing antidote or rhubarb, and gently touch it; let the blood flow out, for if the sweat gland has swelled, leave it be.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides; if, however, it is necessary to release the blood again and there is no other choice, either open it in a different place or on the other arm or in another sweat gland.
And if the vein of the arm must be punctured, it should be done instead of using cinnamon and galangal if they are not available or hidden, as it is composed of them. The method of puncturing it is for the patient to immerse their hand in hot water until the wrist becomes red and perspiration appears clearly, then tie it tightly with a bandage.
Then, puncture the vein at a slight angle, neither too wide nor too narrow, making the incision wide and puncturing it just above the wrist joint. If blood does not flow out easily, place the hand back into the hot water container and let the blood run into the water.
Until your need is met, if it is during the summer months, you may not need to immerse the hand in hot water again. In winter, however, hot water is more effective for making blood flow, and puncturing this vein is safer than any other. Because it has no striking veins or nerves below it, and puncturing the small vein (aslim) from the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments. The method is to tie the wrist with a bandage or tightly grip it after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because it has no striking veins or nerves below it, and puncturing the small vein (aslim) from the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments. The method is to tie the wrist with a bandage or tightly grip it after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells. It should be clearly visible to the touch, and you should puncture it at a slight angle. If you cut it off completely, it will not cause any harm. Be careful; do not overdo it with the scalpel, as there is a nerve under the fingers and the area is exposed without flesh. Then, immerse the hand back into the hot water.
If you allow the blood to flow through it, and do not return it to hot water, the blood will congeal in the pores and stop flowing. If you remove as much blood as needed, apply fat and salt to the pore to prevent it from sealing quickly.
And you should do the same for any narrow vessel. The benefit of cutting a vein from the left hand is useful for spleen ailments, and you should proceed with the cut as you did with the previous one, equally. As for cutting the saphenous vein, its benefit extends to diseases in the lower body, such as those affecting the womb.
For amenorrhea, kidney diseases, chronic ulcers on the thighs and legs, and similar ailments, the procedure involves immersing the foot in hot water, massaging it to make the veins flow, then binding them above the ankle joint with a bandage, placing the vein at the level of the instep.
It branches out on the face with many divisions, so cut it in the widest branch or at the ankle where it meets, as this is best and safest. If you cut it on the face of the man, be careful of the nerves beneath it on his face.
Make the cut by bending it as if you intend to amputate, using a sharp instrument. If the blood does not flow easily, immerse his foot again in hot water and allow the blood to drain until it stops. If the person who is cutting makes a mistake and misses the vein on their first attempt.
If, after cutting, the wound is clean and free from danger, having taken care to avoid the nerve as we have said, then do the same for the instep of the other foot, and regarding sciatica, its position is as we have mentioned, at the heel on the outer side.
The benefit of cutting (the nerve) for hip pain if it is due to hot blood, and the method of cutting involves having the patient enter a hot bath, then quickly and tightly pull the leg from the hip up to the foot with four fingers using a thin, long bandage, which will only reveal itself in this way.
If it appears, cut it in any case, either by bending (the nerve) which is better, or by amputating it entirely, or making a slit in it. Its position is safe, and it is very subtle in most people, so if you do not find it.
If it does not show up at all for the sense, cut some of its fibers which appear on the back of the foot near the little finger and index finger, while being careful with the nerves, and allow the desired amount of blood to flow.
Then, remove the tension, place a cotton ball on the site of the cut, and secure the area. It will quickly heal.
Chapter LXXXIX (69)
In cupping and its method of use.
The cupping instruments may be made of bone, wood, copper, or glass, and there are two types of cupping: one for draining blood (conditional cupping) and the other without drainage (unconditional cupping).
This unconditional cupping has two faces.
And the cups for the temples (on both sides of the neck), and those for the chin (underneath the lower jaw, near the mouth), and those for the shoulders, and those for the hip bone (on the lower back), and those for the elbows (in the middle of the arms), and those for the legs, and those for the ankles.
Cupping draws blood from the delicate veins spread throughout the flesh; for this reason, it does not cause the body to void itself as leeching would, and cupping should not be used for any condition marked by swelling, so that the whole body may be relieved.
If cupping is indicated, whether for illness or by habit, it should be used at any time of the month—first, last, or in between—and at any hour of the day.
That is because some people, when blood accumulates to the extent that it requires removal through cupping, experience a sensation of heaviness and headaches. Others may feel swelling, redness, and discomfort in their faces, heads, and necks. Some have itching on their faces and sides, and darkness and pain in their eyes, while others scratch the area where they had cupping done.
Some people laugh excessively, while others taste blood in their mouths, with swollen gums and bleeding. Some sleep a lot, and in their dreams they see blood, redness, wounds, and other similar things. We should be wary of these signs.
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we prescribe cupping after two or three hours have passed in the day. The benefit of a cupping on the head is that it relieves heaviness and reduces fluid buildup in the eyes.
However, this should be done after a complete evacuation of the body's humors. This cupping can be an alternative to phlebotomy, but it is dangerous for those with cold-blooded temperament or suffering from a cold, as it may cause significant harm.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold-related illnesses should avoid it, as long-term use can lead to memory loss.
Therefore, the cupper should lower their hand slightly during the procedure to prevent memory loss. Cupping on the back is an alternative to phlebotomy for the eyes and tongue.
Therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, cracking in the respiratory system, coughing, and fullness. It is necessary to raise the bleed from the back slightly, because if it is directed downward, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
And as for the bleed from the temples, it is beneficial for pain in the head, eye strain, migraine, sore throat, and pain at the roots of teeth, serving as an alternative to bleeding the basilic vein. The surgeon should instruct the bleeder not to deepen their hand excessively to avoid cutting a artery, leading to bleeding.
And as for the bleed beneath the chin, it is beneficial for ulcers in the mouth, gum disease, and other oral conditions, serving as an alternative to bleeding the gums located between the lips. The bleed from the shoulders is effective for palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
As for the bleed from both sides of the abdomen (the zenzi), it is beneficial for what bleeding into three veins—the basilic, ocular, and temporal—achieves, as it draws blood from all those delicate veins in the flesh and pulls those delicate veins from other, thinner vessels into which they connect, until the attraction reaches the three thick veins.
The surgeon should instruct the bleeder not to delve too deeply into the wound, as the area is devoid of flesh and beneath lie nerves and arteries. However, a single bleed applied to the coccyx (tailbone) is beneficial for hemorrhoids and lower intestinal ulcers.
It is necessary to command the surgeon that the scalpel be large and made of brass, for the site requires a strong cut, and the glass scalpel may break easily. The scalpels for the legs are lacking in fullness, notably.
Because it draws blood from all parts of the body and is beneficial for chronic pain in the kidneys, wombs, and bladders, it regulates menstruation and is effective against boils and fistulas, serving as a substitute for phlego- and lymphatic drainage, except that it exhausts the body greatly and fainting occurs in most people. The scalpels for the ankles have benefits similar to those of scalpels for the legs.
The technique of placing scalpels involves first inserting the scalpel empty and applying a moderate suction, without prolonging the placement. The scalpels should be quickly inserted and removed to allow humors to flow into the site evenly. This process is repeated until the area becomes red and opens up.
When the redness of blood appears, then [the surgeon] should make incisions and gradually increase suction. Then, they should observe the condition of the bodies. If a person has soft flesh with loose pores, they should make only one incision to avoid scarring.
You should command the surgeon to widen and deepen the incision slightly, adjusting the suction with care and gentle movement. If there is thickness in the blood, they should make two incisions: the first to open a path for the flow of thin blood and moisture, and the second to completely remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very muddy, repeat the process a third time to reach the desired outcome. In general, if we want to expel a little blood, one incision is enough; if we want to expel much blood, make more incisions. If we judge that the blood is thick, make several incisions.
If the incision should be deep, the cut should reach only the depth of the skin; no excessive fat or water should be used when applying the leech. This is especially important for those with thick, tough, and dry skin, with narrow pores.
In summer, the incision sites should be rubbed with softening, lubricating, and dissolving oils such as calamus oil or violet oil or sweet almond oil or pumpkin seed oil.
In winter, suitable oils include narcissus oil, iris oil, chamomile oil, and lily of the valley oil; if the excess is thick and cold, use myrrh oil, frankincense oil, rose fat, or mint oil instead.
If the person's pores are large, their flesh tender, and they have a lot of blood, they should avoid oil. Instead, these individuals should wash their leech sites with rosewater or cold water or grapevines water or cucumber water or nettle water after the procedure.
He washes his veins with vinegar or with water containing sumac and similar substances. For those with thick blood, he washes their veins with an old drink, or water of marjoram, or a preparation of fenugreek or chamomile, and similar substances. One must be cautious about cupping after bathing or immediately after bathing.
One should use it (cupping) after leaving the bath, an hour or two later, and no one should sleep after cupping. What one should arrange for the person who is undergoing cupping, both before and after.
One should first examine if the person undergoing cupping or bleeding has a jaundiced appearance, with sharp and inflammatory symptoms in their blood, then they should take cooling substances such as pomegranates, dandelion, vinegar, endive, lettuce, henbane, and similar plants, and make their diet consist of fried foods, lamb meat, bitter fruits, and similar substances.
For those with a cold temperament, one should give honey drink, or a drink made from henbane seeds, and moderate perfumed wine, which is between the old and new. They should be instructed to eat little, and their diet should consist of endive, artichokes, and sparrows' eggs. The drink on the day of cupping and bleeding should be more abundant than food.
In certain cases, it may be necessary to give specific tonics or medications such as the distilling elixir, musk, or chiletha to individuals before cupping or bleeding, or afterwards, in order to strengthen the vital organs and purify the blood. However, it should not be given to those who are feverish.
And as for incisions that are unconditional, they are those made on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney position, and hip joint, because these organs do not tolerate conditionings, but rather aim to draw blood from one member to another.
As for placing the incision on the breasts in the case of nosebleed or using it to release a cold, stiffened air from the organ, it loosens the organ, warms it, and alleviates the pain by releasing that air. Similarly, when we place the incision on the abdomen and navel, it relaxes the organ, heats it, and relieves the pain caused by the trapped air.
It may also be placed on the kidneys if there is a blockage or stone, as the powerful suction might open the blockage or dislodge the stone. Similarly, it acts when placed on the liver and spleen during periods of trapped gas, causing confusion. These incisions can also be used solely through suction.
It can also be used with fire or filled with warm water for conditions of constipation. To do this, the incision should be filled with hot water alone or water in which certain herbs suitable for this purpose have been cooked.
Then, it is placed over the affected area, secured, and removed multiple times as needed. This is an illustration of the incision used with fire:
The mouth's capacity is the width of two fingers, open as we have illustrated, and in depth half a cubit. On its side, there is a small hole that is about half its size, suitable for an needle, made from brass or yellow copper with a thick edge.
Smooth, even, and polished to avoid damaging the organ when placed upon it, there is a crossbar made of copper or iron in its center where the candle with fire is placed. This scale can be made larger than described or smaller according to the diseases.
The shape of the instrument should be considered, for the scales used by boys or thin people are not the same as those used by men. The proper way to use this scale is to light a thread with fire from fine cotton or a small wax candle and place it on the center of the upright bar inside the scale.
The flame should be directed upwards towards the bottom of the scale to prevent the patient's body from burning, and then placed on the organ with a finger on the hole we mentioned, so that when we grasp the scale, the finger can be easily removed.
The steam emerges from the hole, causing the scale to relax on the member. The thread is then placed on the groove and repeated as needed. For the scale used in the case of water retention, it does not have a upright bar or hole.
It is used by filling it with water and placing it only on the affected area, and this is its form:
And the more this vessel is large enough to hold much water, the better it is.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoids are used most often in areas where the application of hot compresses is not possible, either because they are too small, such as the lips and gums, or because the area is exposed and lacks flesh, like the finger and nose, among others.
The method of its use involves taking the fresh, uninfected hemorrhoids and leaving them in clean freshwater for a day and night until they are hungry and empty within. Then the body is purged either by lancing or cupping, and then the affected area is wiped.
Until it turns red, then apply it; if it fills up and falls off, it is effective. If not, wash the area with vinegar and then with plenty of water, massage and squeeze; if the bleeding persists after the hemorrhoid falls off, soak a cotton cloth in cold water.
Place a bandage from above to stop the bleeding, and if the blood is abundant, sprinkle it with a powder of glass or gum or similar constrictors until the bleeding ceases, or apply to the wound halves of the dried and peeled plant (basil).
Leave it until the basil sticks to the wound, then the bleeding will cease. If, however, it is necessary to repeat the leeching, do not use the same leech if possible; if the leech refuses to attach, the area should be wiped with fresh blood.
Alternatively, pierce the wound with a needle to draw out some blood, then apply it. If it feels adherent to the place, you can make it come off by sprinkling it with frankincense or salt or ash.
Third Chapter.
On fractures.
This chapter is also about the treatment of broken bones, including fractures and dislocations.
Know, O children, that this chapter is claimed by some as the sole authority for physicians and laypeople, yet there are those who have not studied a single word from the ancient texts on this subject.
For this reason, this art of science has become non-existent in our country, and I have never encountered a skilled practitioner in it. But I have only gained knowledge of it through lengthy study of the works of the ancients and my diligence in understanding them, until I extracted the science from them, then through experience and practice throughout my life.
I have therefore described for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses on this subject. My experience with it, after I have made it clear for you and simplified it, removing the complexity and condensing it to its essence, and explaining it in detail, has included numerous illustrations of the instruments used in it.
Indeed, it is through increased explanation, as I have done in the previous chapters, that I have provided these details. There is no power but that of the Most High, the Great.
Chapter One.
In this chapter, which deals with the treatment of bone fractures and dislocations, it is appropriate to begin by presenting general principles before discussing specific broken or dislocated members. Initially, we should outline key statements and sections. You must first understand and grasp the truth of these principles if you are to learn this noble art, or teach it to others.
So I say, when a bone is broken, or a joint dislocated, or there is a wound or fall, you should first hasten to sever or relax it, or both. If there is no impediment, such as weakness of strength, or if the event occurred in a young child or an old and frail person, or at a time of extreme heat or extreme cold.
Then, his diet should be limited to cold legumes, poultry, and fowl, while avoiding drinks, hearty meats, overindulgence in food, and any meals that fill the veins with blood, until the swelling is alleviated and there is no expectation of effusion into the affected area.
Then, the patient should return to his initial diet according to his usual habits. If the broken bone is being set, the patient should consume foods that are rich, dense, and strong, such as porridge, rice, heads of grain, and beef bellies. Eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, among others, will aid in the speedy and effective healing of the fracture. Be aware that broken bones in strong men or old people never fully heal to their original state.
The dryness and hardness of their bones, and sometimes the softest bone can join and adhere to the hardest, as in the bones of young children, but nature generates on the broken bone from all sides a substance similar to glue, which thickens and adheres, thus uniting them.
They adhere to each other so that they become as strong and secure as they were originally, without anything hindering their functions.
For this reason, the patient's diet should include foods that are firm, sticky, and thick, as we have mentioned. Know that fractures vary in type depending on the member affected, for a fracture of the leg bone is not like a fracture of the skull bone, or a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone.
Similarly, all other members differ from one another, and we will mention each type of fracture, explaining it in detail in its respective section, without repetition. The type of bone fracture can also vary within itself.
Because it may be a fracture without chips, and it may be a fracture along the length of the bone with fragments that are either healing or unhealed, and the fracture may occur with a wound and tear in the skin, and it may be a slight crack.
Each type has a specific method of treatment, which will be detailed in its respective section, as follows: The recognition of a bone fracture is through its deformity, loss of function, sensitivity, and crepitus when touched with the hand.
When there is no visible deformity, nor any creaking or sensation of disturbance upon palpation of the bone, and the patient experiences little pain, it is not a fracture but may be a sprain, a slight break, or a thin crack. In such cases, it should not be moved by stretching or twisting under any circumstances.
Instead, apply to it the medications mentioned later, suitable for the condition, and then gently tighten it. Know that if a bone breaks and splits into two without causing fragments, its parts may still separate from each other.
You should promptly correct and set it straight before a severe swelling occurs, for if a severe swelling does develop, leave it for several days until the swelling subsides, then straighten it as best you can with kindness and ingenuity.
Know that setting and straightening it is easier than dealing with a bone that has fragments, then proceed as follows: if there are fragments, extend the broken member from both sides, whether it is a hand or a leg.
Either use your hands for a small member, or two ropes, or a rope and a hand, and place the member on a level surface in its natural shape. Once the broken parts of the bone have extended, then cut off the excess with whatever means you can, using all possible care and ingenuity.
Take care not to cause the patient pain or discomfort during your treatment, and strive to align one bone with its companion in the best manner possible. At this time, you should touch and feel them with your hand. If you find anything amiss, correct it and make it even as best as you can.
Beware of excessive stretching or forceful manipulation, as many ignorant people do, causing hot swelling or damage to the member, as you have often seen from their actions.
Then, after adjusting and perfecting the position, ensure that member remains still and at rest. Warn the patient to avoid moving it during wakefulness, sleep, transition, disturbance, or defecation, and strive for a posture that relieves pain.
If, while in a certain position, the patient feels pain or discomfort, they should change to a different posture where they are free from pain, and ensure that this new position is level and straight.
To prevent any deformation of the member if it is straightened, and regarding the method of binding a broken member, as I have described to you. Know that broken members vary in size and shape, such as the arm, finger, ulna, and others.
The bandages should be soft and flexible, and if they are thick, such as those for the thigh, back, or chest, they should be wide and rigid, since a broad strap holds a large member firmly from all sides without any gap.
Then, after you have finished adjusting, you begin to apply the appropriate plaster. In a gentle tension over the fracture site, begin wrapping the bandage around the same area three or four times, depending on the size of the member, slightly tightening the bandage with each wrap, and then move it up to the upper side of the fracture.
With less tension than you applied to the fractured site, then slightly space out the wraps from the fracture and relax the tension little by little until you achieve a suitable position, taking a second bandage to wrap it around the broken place as well.
Continue wrapping, moving the bandage down to the lower side of the fracture. Follow the same procedure for tension and relaxation as with the first wrap around the upper side, and place a layer of soft padding or cloth between the wraps to help align and stabilize the fracture.
If there is an angle, do not add any padding; otherwise, wrap another bandage over the existing ones and secure with firm splints if the member is not swollen or hot to the touch.
If there is swelling or a hot tumor, apply what soothes that tumor and dispels the swelling, then leave it for some days before applying compression bandages. The bandages can be made from halves of wide bamboo strips carved and shaped wisely, or they can be made from grapevine wood.
which are made from cedar or palm fronds or juniper or heather, and other similar materials readily available, and each bandage should be of the same size and shape as shown.
Except that the bandage applied directly to the broken bone should be thicker and wider than the others, and the length of the bandage is made according to what suits the size of the broken member. The shape of the bandage is as follows:
Then, apply another strip of bandage according to the first tension, and bind it with strong threads as mentioned, ensuring more tension on the broken place. And the tension should be lessened as it gets farther from the broken bone.
The threads should be of medium thickness and softness, and it is best to use wet cotton threads specifically. The threads should not be too thick like those made from twisted jute strips, as this is a great mistake often committed by the ignorant.
Because pulling on it exceeds the moderate amount, and delicate threads are also unsuitable because you cannot achieve the desired tension with them, and there should not be less than a finger between the splints.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after proper tensioning, place beneath them soft padding or fluffy wool so that nothing harms him from it, and if the fracture is with a wound and there is a tear in the skin, we will mention it separately.
Know that not every broken member should be immobilized with splints from the first day, for if the member is large, splints should not be applied to it until five or seven days have passed, or more, according to your security from the hot swelling.
This is the description of the bandages that were used by the ancients to immobilize fractures, dislocations, and cracks: a general, concise dressing that sets the bone, suitable for most conditions, especially for children and women, as it is neither too hot nor too cold.
It is to take flour dust, the inner part of the wheat that adheres to the walls of the millstone when the grinder rotates, and knead it as it is, without sifting it with egg whites, making sure it is neither too thick nor too thin, then roll it out.
A last dressing for fractures, dislocations, and contusions: taken from sheep, lamb, acacia, raisin, alder, and clay, ten dirhams each. From the poppy and patience, five dirhams each. From olive or Armenian/Roman clay, twenty dirhams. All should be crushed and mixed with white of egg or mint water, if the patient's condition is hot. This dressing, when used, is good for composition, quickly mends broken bones, and is suitable for most people due to its moderation.
Another dressing that is also beneficial for fractures and contusions: take alder, poplar, and acacia, ten dirhams each. From the poppy and patience, five dirhams each. Armenian clay, twenty dirhams. Crush everything finely, sift it, and mix with water or egg white to use.
A dressing for joints and bones that have come out of their place, alleviating the pain and settling the cracking of bones and fractures: take woolen padding, immerse it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply to the affected area. This dressing is not powerful for mending.
However, it is excellent for alleviating edema and relieving pain, especially heat-related swelling. A final dressing that mends a broken bone: take papery olive leaves and wild poppy leaves, crush them together, and use as a wet dressing. Another concise dressing used when a bone has snapped: apply crushed leaves directly to the affected area.
And if you wish to analyze the remaining tumor, take a part from each of the original materials - chamomile, malva, violet, and fennel seed - making them all fine and mix with paint if the tissue is not fresh; if it is fresh, mix it with parsley water or water. Use it.
The stronger poultice, in the second instance, is used when a solid tumor occurs due to a broken bone. Take a part of each: chamomile, flaxseed, fennel, rosemary, lavender, and malva.
All should be ground and mixed with either parsley water, fresh water, or paint, depending on the temperature of the tissue and its state. Hippocrates did not mention in his book that it should be placed on a broken member when setting it.
However, Galen suggested that substances with astringent properties and some heat, such as pepper, alum, and resin, should be placed on the broken member during its setting.
A poultice that is beneficial for weakness and pain: take equal parts of licorice, chickpeas, human hair (cut), bird feathers, chamomile, and salt. Grind, sieve, mix, and apply as a compress. The amount of binding required depends on the size of the wound.
Then, if it heals, you should observe. If no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone occurs in the patient, do not treat it for many days. If such symptoms appear at the site, then treat it.
So, act swiftly and treat it at that moment, without delay. Remove the dressing, then take a soft cloth or sponge dipped in warm water and wash the affected area until the itching and pain subside. Leave the member to rest for an hour.
Then, apply a cloth soaked in vinegar and oil (or rose fat) and secure it with bindings for the night, to prevent swelling, relieve pain, and ease the member's discomfort. After that, reapply gentle bindings and light dressings, not as tightly as before.
Treat it gently until it heals, if the swelling, redness, pain, and other symptoms disappear completely, and you still need to use bindings and tight dressing, apply them as initially done. If none of the aforementioned symptoms occur, proceed as before.
Do not treat it until three, four, five, or seven days have passed, and sometimes even up to 20 days, depending on the patient's condition as described. Once the bone is healed and the flesh has closed around it.
Increase the tension at that time even more than your initial tension, and also increase the thickness of the food for the patient as mentioned earlier. If you find that the fracture site has dried out and become weaker than it should be, know that the food is prevented from reaching it.
Then, each time you apply it, immerse it in warm water and do this every three days, reducing the tension slightly. This action allows food to reach the member and promotes quick healing. On the other hand, what the ignorant do by breaking the member again is harmful.
For if it is not set right as it should be and is instead set in a crooked position, it is an error on their part and a great risk. If it were correct, they would have mentioned it in the first books and practiced it; but I have seen no trace of this among them. The correct course of action is not to follow it.
Chapter Two
On the Occurrence of Fractures in the Head.
There are many types of fractures occurring in the head, with various shapes and differing causes. Some fractures result from sword strikes and may completely sever the bone, extending to the abdominal cavity beneath the bone. As it does in wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called "coming-in" and it may be that the sword cuts through some of the bone, leaving its point only in the surface, and the cut does not penetrate to the end. This type of fracture is called a complete dislocation, and these fractures can be either large or small.
Some fractures are fragmented or crushed, caused by a blow with a stone or falling onto a stone or similar. These fractures can either penetrate closely to the membrane beneath the bone or affect the surface of the bone.
The size of these fractures can also be either large or small, and some fractures may be subtle, hidden within the bone, just visible as a thin split, known as a fine fracture.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called "hairy" (or "coarse"), and it may occur from a fall or a blow with a stone or similar, where the bone surface is penetrated into the interior, leaving a concave shape, much like a dent in copper when struck.
These conditions are most common in soft, growing bones, such as the heads of children's bones. All these types of fractures can have detached or adherent fragments, and we will discuss their treatment in detail in a later section, identifying each type through examination.
Inspection and removal of rotten flesh with probes, and for the hairy type, it is known by exposing the bone and wiping and marking it with ink; then the fracture appears black. As for the treatment of a fracture, first consider the symptoms of the patient.
If you observe symptoms that clearly indicate fear, such as vomiting bitter substances, restlessness, loss of consciousness, hoarseness, fainting, fever, redness and swelling of the eyes, and other similar symptoms, do not approach or treat the patient. In most cases, death is inevitable with these symptoms.
If you observe symptoms that do not cause severe concern and you hope for his safety, then proceed with treatment. If the wounded person comes to you soon after being injured, especially during the winter months, you should:
You should make every effort to remove the bone within 14 days, or even earlier in summer, before the tissue under the bone decays, as this may lead to the symptoms we described.
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and there is crushing or bruising, you should cut off the damaged part as I have described, which involves shaving the head of the wounded patient.
Expose the bone in any way that is possible for you, depending on the shape of the wound and what eases the patient's discomfort. If, upon examining the bone, you see bleeding or a hot swelling, treat it as necessary.
It is to fill the wound with bandages soaked in a mixture of rose water and fat, then clean the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding stops, after which one proceeds to trim the bone and extract it, all of which can be done through one of two methods.
The single method is to cut the bone with a delicate, narrow blade, and this is its image: .
Then one uses another blade, slightly wider than the first, and its image is: .
Then one also uses another blade, wider than the previous one, and it is necessary to have several blades of varying width and sharpness, some longer and some shorter, preferably made of Indian steel or good quality steel.
And use gentle force when striking the blade, so as not to dislodge the head and cause harm, for if the bone is strong and hard, one should drill around it before using the blades with non-penetrating drills, which they call "non-grouting drills.
Because they do not extend beyond the skull bone, as the drill bit has a rounded tip similar to a ring or small circle below its sharp head, which prevents it from penetrating and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
You should choose from these drills a large number, each of which is suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have for every skull with a hole a drill whose sharp end in length and shortness corresponds to the thickness of that skull, and this is a picture of three types. From the drills, large, medium, and small.
As for the method of drilling around a fractured bone, you place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you feel that the bone has been penetrated, then move the drill to another location and make holes at intervals corresponding to the thickness of the rod or similar.
Then, you cut with the saws between each hole as much as possible with kindness, as we have said, until you remove the bone either by hand or with other tools prepared for that purpose.
Like pincers and gentle tweezers, you must be extremely careful not to let the drill or saw touch the peritoneum. If you successfully strengthen the bone and separate it from the peritoneum, and extract it, then you should clean it.
You smooth the roughness of what remains in the bone with another tool similar to a saw, but it should be thinner and gentler than other saws. If there are any remaining small bones or fragments, you carefully remove them with the tools at your disposal.
Then, the wound is treated subsequently with tourniquets and ointments as mentioned, while the other aspect of the work concerns what is easy to perform and free from risk, as described by Galen, who praised it greatly, saying: You should first begin by exposing the portion of the bone in the location where the fracture is most severe and prominent, and once you have exposed that part, place the tip of this lens-shaped fragment underneath it. And here is its image:
The lens-shaped fragment should be smooth, not cutting anything, and the sharp part on its sides, when extended in length, as you can see, is to rest against the peritoneum, and the face of the sharp fragment against the bone; then strike on the fragment from one side.
With a small hammer, cut all the bone gently as it rotates, and be secure from the peritoneum; it will not cause any frightening incident at all. Even if the healer is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he is asleep.
If anything remains necessary for the bone from the peritoneum in some locations of the bone, scrape it off with the same lens-shaped fragment, and remove it gently; it will come off without harm or fear.
And if the bone fracture did not penetrate the peritoneum, and what broke off from the bone has a rough surface with fine fragments remaining in it, you should smooth that roughness and remove those fragments using delicate forceps; prepare a set of different sizes from these forceps, so that you can use the most suitable and appropriate one for each location as guided by the work.
On the Same Bone and Its Shape: You should first examine the bone using the widest of knives, then use a narrower one after that, continuing in this manner until you reach the most precise and finest among them all.
As for other minute cracks and delicate breaks, they should be treated according to what leads to their healing, which is something evident to anyone with even a slight experience in this field, and by referring to what we have written and explained regarding major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, take a piece of cotton cloth suitable for the wound and dip it in rose fat, then place it on the wound. Then take another cloth, folded or cut into a triangle shape. Dip it in a drink and rose fat, then place it on the first cloth, doing so as gently as possible to avoid weighing down the peritoneum. Then use a wide bandage and only tighten it enough to secure the wound.
Leave it with this treatment for one or two days until the hot swelling subsides, then remove the bandage and use medications with a drying effect, such as roots of coltsfoot, flour of horseradish, ground myrrh, turmerick, and similar herbs, by making powders from these medications.
Treat the wound while it is still dry, and use a medicine that clarifies without causing irritation. During treatment, strive for cleanliness, ensuring no fat, dirt, or pus accumulates.
Since pus, if it accumulates on the brain membrane, corrupts and spoils it, causing great harm to the patient. It may appear in the skull's dura mater when the bone becomes exposed, especially if treatment is neglected.
If you see blackness on its surface, and the patient exhibits the symptoms we mentioned, know that death is inevitable. Even if the blackness occurred due to a medication applied, that medicine was strong enough to cause this blackness.
One should take a portion of honey and three parts of rose fat, mix them well, apply the mixture to the dura mater, and then treat it with all the necessary remedies until healing occurs.
Chapter III
Treating a broken nose.
Know that the nose is broken when both upper cracks (or one) are affected, as they are bones. The lower part is cartilage and does not break, but it may bend, become deformed, or suffer from pressure.
If one of the sides breaks, the little finger should be inserted into the nasal hole and that fracture should be set from inside with the index finger and thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape, and this should be done gently, taking care not to cause pain to the patient.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger did not reach it, it should be set with a slight bend at its end, and if the fracture is on both sides, do the same, and seek to correct it on the very first day of the fracture.
If possible, and otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling subsides, then a thread of linen should be inserted into the nasal hole if the fracture is on one side, or two threads if the fracture is on both sides.
The threads should be of a thickness that fills the nasal hole, and some early surgeons recommended greasing them with lard and changing them every day, although I do not agree with this. Instead, I suggest soaking the threads in a paste made from egg whites and flour ground into a powder.
Then, the threads should be left until the bone heals and the cartilage hardens. After this, pipes made from duck feathers can be inserted into the nose where the threads were, wrapped in soft cloth, to keep them in place, making it easier for the patient to breathe.
And if you wish, you can make them (bandages), even if in the course of your work a hot swelling appears on the nose, then bandage the nose with pitch or a cotton swab soaked in vinegar and rose oil or any other dye from the diakonion ointment.
If no hot swelling appears, then it should be bandaged from the outside with fine semolina and ground myrrh, mixed with egg white, then place a soft pad on top, but do not tie the nose at all, for if the nasal bones break, they should not be bound.
Or if they break, you should make an incision and remove them with the appropriate tool, then sew up the cut and treat it with suitable healing ointments, for if there is a wound inside the nose, it should be treated with bandages and lead pipes. until it heals.
Chapter IV
In the case of broken lower jawbones.
If the lower jawbone breaks and there is no wound, and it is broken from outside without splitting into two pieces and does not collapse inward, then its condition is clear.
If the fracture is in the right side, the index finger of the left hand should be inserted into the patient's mouth, and likewise, if the fracture is on the left side, the index finger of the right hand should be used to lift the deformity gently from inside out.
With your other hand, from outside the bone, you control its alignment. If the jaw fracture is split in two, it should be straightened by applying pressure from both sides until it is corrected. If it affects the teeth, they should be extracted.
If the wound does not heal with a thread of gold, silver, or silk, then apply pitch to the broken jaw, place a folded cloth over it, and use a large, tight splint or a piece of leather from a horse's hoof that is the same length as the jaw. Then, secure it from above as best you can, ensuring the binding is tight to prevent disruption. Order the patient to rest and maintain a calm demeanor. Provide soft porridge as food. If, after three days, you notice any change in the shape, immediately untie it.
Then, secure it from above as best you can, ensuring the binding is tight to prevent disruption. Order the patient to rest and maintain a calm demeanor. Provide soft porridge as food. If, after three days, you notice any change in the shape, immediately untie it. Then, prepare a new dressing with flour from a mortar, mixed with egg white or fine semolina, after removing the pitch. Place a soft pad over the wound and secure it with gentle bindings. As long as the dressing adheres well and there is no change in the bone's condition, leave it intact.
Do not reduce it until the fracture heals and the bone strengthens. For this fracture often becomes more severe within three weeks, if a hot swelling appears during that time, use what we have mentioned repeatedly to soothe it until that swelling disappears.
If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a fragment or fragments of bone have separated, be gentle in removing them, using whatever means are appropriate for their extraction from the body. If the opening of the wound is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as much as necessary.
Then, if you have removed the fragments and none remain, outline the wound with a line if it is wide, or apply one of the appropriate ointments to it. And heal the wound until it heals.
Chapter V.
On the treatment of a broken collarbone.
The collarbone (clavicle) most often breaks in the front, near its end at the shoulder joint, and it can break in one of three ways: either it cracks without splitting into pieces, or it breaks into two pieces, or it shatters into multiple fragments. The first case is the easiest to treat.
If the fracture involves fragments, which is more difficult to set, or if it occurs with a wound, when dealing with a fracture without a wound, one should have two assistants: one to hold the humerus next to the broken scapula, and the other to stretch the neck towards the opposite side.
Then, align the fracture with your fingers until it assumes the desired shape and there is no displacement or deformity; if more extension is required, place a ball of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit.
The bone should be manipulated as needed, stretching and lifting the scapula while pressing the ball with your hand to align the fracture correctly. If it is impossible to draw the edge of the scapula outward due to its depth, the patient should lie on their back.
Place a pillow under the patient's arm, and have an assistant press the scapula downward to lift the deeply situated bone above; at this point, you can align and correct the fracture using your fingers.
If you sense that a fragment of the scapula has broken off and is moving, you should carefully drill into it to remove the fragment; if the fragment is trapped within the bone, use one of the prepared cutting tools to free it. After becoming under the axilla is the mechanism that preserves the peritoneum, which is a device made of wood or iron, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a handle, and its width should be according to the size of the bone, whether large or small, and its length should also be according to what is suitable for work. It should have two ends; one end is wider, and the other is narrower.
If the wound tear that you made when removing the shard of bone is wide and you have ensured the hot tumor, then close the wound with stitches. If the tear is slight or you fear the hot tumor, then widen the wound with more cuts and bandages according to the extent of the tear.
If there is a hot tumor, moisten the wound with rose fat and vinegar or wine, and apply it. For severe bone fractures without wounds or cuts, cover the bone with a compress made from flour and egg white. Place a soft pad on it, then place a ball under his armpit if necessary, then take a long cloth, about a span wide, and wrap it around the padding, bandage, and splint, then take a thin board as a splint. It should be three fingers wide and long, then insert it into a cloth, wrap the cloth around the splint and the wound, and place it in the position of the wrap on the fracture, then tighten the wrap around the fracture as you would spin. Position the splint along his neck, under the healthy armpit and under the affected armpit, and repeat this process on both sides. As you can see, the tension secures the fracture firmly, which is evident.
And it is imperative that the splint not be removed from the broken bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day. If the bandage relaxes and the splint falls off, tighten the bandage and then have the patient sleep on their back with a small pillow under their armpit at night.
To raise the arm, have the patient rest it against their side, which will elevate the broken shoulder to the level of the shoulder joint. If no complications such as itching or swelling occur within twelve days, do not loosen the bandage.
Then, renew the bandage if necessary. Apply tension and maintain it until the fracture heals and solidifies, strengthening and gaining more power within twenty-eight days. This may occur in some people in less time.
Chapter VI.
In the treatment of a fractured shoulder, if the shoulder is not broken at its broadest point but only at its edges, then when a fracture occurs in one place or in the middle, it can only be determined by touch. According to the shape of the fracture, the treatment will vary.
After reducing the fracture and returning it to its natural position using all available means, apply a layer of powder from a mortar along with egg white and soft linen bandages. Place a supporting pad made from a folded cloth on top, then cover it with a wide splint made from a board.
Make the splint thin, covering the entire shoulder or slightly wider. If there is a protrusion under the splint from a fracture in one of the shoulder's places, correct it using a soft linen bandage until the splint lies flat, then secure it with a long cloth wrap.
Tightly secure the splint and ensure it remains in place, checking the bandage daily. If it loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint. The patient should lie on their healthy side, and the shoulder will heal in approximately 20 days.
After 20 or 25 days, if this period is complete, release the bandage with confidence, for it is a bone that is unlikely to break or splinter further. If a fragment of bone protrudes and presses against the skin, make an incision and extract it. Make what is mentioned regarding the treatment of the broken clavicle in case of a hot tumor, if such occurs.
Chapter VII
In the treatment of broken ribs.
The chest may break in the middle, but this is rare; more commonly, it breaks at its extremities, which shatter and fracture easily. Among its symptoms, if the chest breaks in the middle, it tilts downward, causing severe pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, and distress.
And if blood gushes out, the deformity of the broken bone becomes evident to the touch; it must be set by having the patient lie on his back, placing a cushion between his shoulders, pressing the elbows, and bringing the ribs together with the hands from both sides, while softening its positioning as much as possible.
And once the bone returns to its proper form, apply a splint and bandage over it, placing a light wooden splint, such as willow or hemlock, wrapped in cloth over it. Then, gently secure the bandage to the broken bone to prevent its displacement; wrap the bandage around the back in a circular motion multiple times and tighten it firmly. Check the bandage regularly and tighten it whenever it loosens.
If a wound or pain or swelling arises and requires treatment, address it immediately, remove the dressing, treat what has arisen with regard to its cure, and then replace the dressing if you deem it appropriate. Apply pressure and compress it until it heals.
Chapter VIII
In the case of a broken rib, know that fractures typically occur in the stiff parts adjacent to the back or at the ends from the front, due to their cartilaginous nature. This is easily discerned through physical examination with the fingers.
Correct it by aligning the break with the fingers on the strong portion until the shape is as it should be, then bandage and secure the broken bone with a splint if necessary. If the ribs are fractured inward, it can cause severe pain for the patient.
And the puncture, like a puncture that occurs in those with a hernia, as the bone punctures the peritoneum, and it also causes difficulty breathing, coughing, and spitting up large amounts of blood, which is difficult to treat. The ancients used many tricks for this.
Some said that the patient's diet should include foods that produce gas and wind to inflate the abdomen, allowing the fracture to push outward. We dislike this method, as it may cause or worsen an internal heat swelling. If it does not occur, then it might lead to its development, exacerbating the condition.
Some say that a cup should be applied to the site and then sucked out strongly, similar to the previous method, except that there is a concern that the cup might attract curiosity to the weak area. Some suggest that the site should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
The dressing should be placed between the ribs until it fills, making the bandage even when rolled into a circle, then treat the patient with food and medicine as for a broken bone; if the injury is severe, the patient cannot bear it. The bone was piercing the peritoneum painfully, and we were concerned for the patient, so we should make an incision at the site, expose the broken rib, and place under it the device that preserves the peritoneum, as described previously, and carefully cut and remove the bone.
Then, if the wound is large, sew it shut and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling appears, hurry to soak the dressings in rose oil and apply them to the site, also treating the patient internally to alleviate the swelling.
He should lie on the side that makes it easier for him to sleep until he heals.
Chapter IX
In the treatment of fractures of the back and neck.
If the bones of the neck are fractured, and such an injury is rare, it is often due to impact or pressure, and similarly, the vertebrae of the back should be considered in the same manner. If you encounter such a case, to determine whether the patient will recover or not. Examine their hands; if you find them limp, numb, and lifeless, with no ability to move or grasp, and if pricking or poking them with a needle causes no sensation or pain, then know that recovery is unlikely in most cases, for they are destined to perish.
If they can move their hands and feel when pricked or poked, indicating that the spinal cord is unharmed, and if the patient recovers with treatment, then knowing whether the same applies to fractures of the back, you should understand that recovery is indeed possible.
Examine his legs; if they are weak and show similar symptoms to the hands, and if laying on his back causes gas or feces to escape involuntarily, or turning onto his stomach makes urine leak out uncontrollably, then the recovery process is complex. If he lies on his back and cannot urinate, it is a sign of impending death, so do not bother with treatment. If none of these symptoms occur, the condition is less severe. Treatment involves alleviating the intense swelling.
By applying rose fat alone or, alternatively, fried egg whites to the affected sinus three times a day, one can alleviate the hot swelling. Once the inflammation subsides, apply a strengthening and drying dressing to the area, secure it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to remain still and at rest.
He should not sleep on the affected side until the pain disappears. If a fracture or something that has come loose involves the bone, it is necessary to incise the skin and extract the bone. Then, if the wound is large, close its edges with stitching, and treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx (the tailbone) breaks, insert the little finger of the left hand into the anus.
Adjust the broken bone with the other hand as best you can, then apply a dressing and a splint if necessary, and secure it tightly.
If you feel a broken fragment inside, incise the skin and extract it, then treat the wound as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Ten
In setting a hip fracture.
If the bones of the hip do not break, or if they do break, it is only that they crack at their extremities and split along their length, inclining inward, and cause pain in the affected area for the patient, numbness, and paralysis of the leg from which the fracture occurred.
It should be manipulated with your hand to assess the fracture and its position. If the fracture is only at the extremities, adjust it as best as you can to resemble its natural shape.
If the fracture is along its length or has inclined inward, lay the patient on their stomach to manipulate the fracture. Once adjusted, apply a bandage and then place a splint made of wood or leather, securing it tightly.
Do not be concerned about the fracture moving or the splint coming off, and correct any indentation in the hips using a filler to ensure equal pressure. Order the patient to sleep on their back or their healthy side, and if a hot swelling occurs...
Cease to extend or manipulate the fracture until the hot swelling subsides, and apply what has been mentioned to soothe it. Then return to setting and securing the splint as appropriate. If any fragments or fragmentation from its extremities are visible on the bone, they should not be removed.
It should not be touched from within, but only smoothed from without, and its tension should be left until it heals.
Chapter XI.
In the setting of a humeral fracture.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder. If it breaks, it can be set in one of two ways: by using a curved, smooth stick of moderate thickness, as illustrated.
Both ends of the stick should be tied with bindings, then it is hung from a high place. The patient sits on a chair and places their broken arm on the stick, so that their armpit rests in the middle of the stick's curve. Then a heavy object is hung above it.
Or a servant can extend it downwards, and the physician can adjust the fracture with both hands, ensuring it aligns properly. The alternative method is to have the patient lie on their back, and hang their hand from their neck with a binding.
Then command two servants: one to hold the upper part of the fracture with both hands, and the other to hold the lower part. If you wish for a stronger pull, tighten bindings beneath and above the fracture, and have each servant extend their arm towards their respective direction.
If the fracture is close to the side of the shoulder joint, the bandage should be placed under the armpit and the other end under the fracture towards the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, the bandage should be applied at that point and also around the elbow itself.
Then, the fracture should be gently adjusted without force until it is aligned as required and united well. If there is no sign of fever, it should be immobilized. If a fever occurs, do not immobilize it until the seventh day, applying a compress soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Once the swelling has subsided, then immobilize it. The procedure involves placing a bandage over the fracture, covering it with a new cloth wrap, and then wrapping the arm around the elbow with the hand facing downward towards the shoulder.
Carry the cloth and tighten it around the upper arm and forearm, allowing the arm to act as a splint if there are no obstructions and the fractured bone does not change position. If you fear that the fracture may shift, use traditional splints instead.
This involves placing a splint directly on the fracture, which should be wider and stronger than other splints. There should be a space of one finger width between each splint, and the length of the splints should correspond to the fracture, with an additional three fingers' worth of material on each side.
Then, apply the tension to the bandages as mentioned in the introduction of this book.
And it should be that your tension on the fracture site is greater.
And the more distant the fracture, the less tension should be applied; and when you apply the bandages and tension as we have said in your time of setting the member, then do so.
And if you fear the formation of a hot swelling, then leave off the tension and bandages until the seventh day, as we have said; then examine the dressing every three days to ensure that there is no itching, bulging, or blockage of food reaching the member due to excessive tension, so that all these issues may be rectified as we have mentioned.
If you are certain that none of these issues will occur, then do not remove the dressing for a long time; and the patient should lie on his back, with his hand on his stomach and placed under the arm a padded cushion filled with wool, moderate in thickness.
Examine at all times, day or night, to ensure that the shape of the fractured member does not change or that the bandage does not become loose; and rectify all these issues to the best of your ability, and provide the patient's food according to the order we have given, that it be soft initially, so that when the bone begins to harden.
It is necessary to thicken his diet, for the arm and leg usually harden in forty days, at which time they should be loosened and a bath taken, and treatment with ointments suitable for this purpose, if the fracture is severe and dislocated.
Do not loosen the bandage for fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve
In the Reduction of Arm Fractures.
The arm consists of two bones, called the humeri, one smaller than the other, which is adjacent to the thumb, and the other larger, placed below the smaller one. It is possible for the larger humerus to break alone, or the smaller one, or both together.
When the smaller upper humerus breaks, its reduction is easier and recovery faster. However, when the lower humerus breaks, the fracture is more severe and healing slower. The worst case is when both bones break together; if the bone attached to the smaller humerus breaks, the prognosis is better.
When reducing the fracture, the doctor should make it easy and gentle to align the bones. If the larger humerus is broken, the stretch should be more severe; if both humeri are broken, the stretch should be much stronger.
The hand should be positioned when setting and extending it on a cushion, with the thumb above all the fingers and the little finger below all the others, while the patient is seated in a comfortable position.
Let the cushion be at the same height as his face to avoid any discomfort for the patient.
Then, the assistant extends the arm from below either by hand or with a strap, and another assistant extends it from above as well. The doctor then adjusts the bone until it is in the best possible shape, crushing any shrapnel if there are fragments in a broken bone.
Crush each fragment back into its place as much as possible. If a fragment is protruding and causing skin irritation but cannot be reduced, make an incision and extract it as described previously. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate chapter has been dedicated to it.
If, while you are initially setting the bone, a hot swelling appears, apply a cloth soaked in a mixture of rose oil and white wax, medium between thickness and thinness, and gently compress it until the swelling subsides.
Remove the cloth and apply a dressing made from flour with egg white. Then, prepare splints, making sure that the one placed directly on the fracture is slightly wider and stronger. Note that in most cases, six splints will be required for the arm.
When the fracture is in one clavicle or in both, then make your grip on the site of the fracture stronger and more intense. And whenever you rotate the tension upwards or downwards, make the tension slightly looser as mentioned earlier at the beginning of this section.
And let the bandages wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, not too stiff. The thread used for tightening should be of special linen, medium between softness and hardness, as described earlier. Check the member and ligament after several days.
If anything needs to be corrected, such as a itching in the member, it should be soaked in warm water until the itching subsides. The member should then be left unstrained for the night to rest, and strain should be resumed afterward.
If the tension has loosened and the bone has shifted or something similar, use all your effort to correct it. Also, check if food is unable to reach the member due to excessive tension; in that case, loosen it slightly and leave it for several days until nutrition reaches it, then tighten it again.
If the patient does not experience any of what we mentioned, no treatment should be initiated until after 20 days or so. Then, hang the patient's affected arm from their neck, keeping it at a moderate length and conserving their strength from abrupt movements. They should sleep on their back.
Know that this fracture of the arm will heal in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps even in twenty-eight days; all of this depends on the conditions of the humors and the strength.
Chapter XIII.
In setting a broken hand and fingers.
The metacarpal bone of the hand and the phalanges of the fingers are rarely broken, but they are often bruised. If there is a fracture or bruising to the hand, it is as follows.
The patient should sit cross-legged, with a level chair in front of them.
Then he places his hand on it, extends it, and the osteopath straightens the broken bone until it is properly aligned. If there is no swelling or heat, then a splint should be applied over it as needed.
It should be placed in a soft cloth, and if the fracture is towards the palm, make a semi-sphere of cloth and order the patient to grasp it with their broken hand, then secure it with a long piece of cloth.
The splint should be made of soft leather that conforms to the bend of the hand and holds it in place, especially when the fracture protrudes. In such cases, a splint should be applied above and below the hand to keep it open and extended.
Then the tension should be carried as the hand rotates, and the fingers should be interlocked with bindings. If the fracture affects one of the phalanges, the thumb should be positioned as needed, then secured along with the hand. If desired, a small, separate splint can be used to stabilize the fracture.
If the fracture does not shift and involves any of the other fingers (middle, index, ring, or pinky), they should be aligned and bound together with the adjacent healthy finger, or all secured in order, which is preferable. Alternatively, a small, separate splint can be used to stabilize them.
As mentioned earlier, with regard to the thumb, inspect it during the splinting process and ensure it is freed from excessive heat swelling. Adjust and apply the necessary treatments as described previously.
Chapter XIV
In Splinting the Hip Fracture.
The femur bone often breaks and is easily felt due to its movement forward and backward. Its splinting involves securing a strap above the fracture and another below, with the patient lying on their face.
Then, each servant tie should be extended to its side with moderation if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But if it is near the origin of the thigh, a soft tie made of wool or similar material should be tightened.
If the fracture is at the origin of the thigh, extending up to the groin, then one tie should be above and another below the fracture; likewise, if it is near the knee, the tie should be close to the knee, extending downwards. Then the doctor should adjust the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural shape.
The bone will heal well when, in the absence of swelling, it is bandaged and compressed. If there is a hot swell, leave it for some days until the hot swelling subsides, then resume treatment.
As for compression, a broad and hard bandage should be wound around the fracture twice or three times, leaving some excess. Then, the leg should be twisted until the heel is at the origin of the thigh, and a long thread should be inserted between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, with the ends of the thread extending above from both sides.
Then, the remaining bandage should be wrapped around the leg and thigh, forming a single brace on the thigh at the fracture site. The space between the thigh and leg should be filled with soft cloth to ensure equal compression.
Then begin to tighten the strong ligature from the middle to the fracture site, three or four times, and as you move away from the fracture with the bandage, your tension should be less and more gentle and loose.
Then, proceed to the ends of the thread that you had inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie it to the subsequent bandages above, then pass the ends of the thread downward until it ends at the heel of the man, and also tighten the ends of the bandages on the other side with them.
To prevent the bandage from slipping out of its position, leave the tension on it as long as there is no pain, swelling, or inflammation in the member. If any such thing occurs, hurry to untie it and rectify all that has happened, as we have mentioned many times before.
If there is a splinter in the bone that protrudes, you should smooth it out if possible, otherwise cut it off and extract it, then treat the wound as mentioned before until it heals. This fracture of the thigh may be secured without adding the leg with bandages.
As we mentioned regarding the humerus and arm, except that its treatment in this way does not expose the patient to a limp. However, if only the upper arm is broken without including the leg, it is certain that the patient will always walk with a limp.
Know that the thigh will stiffen for fifty days or a little more or less, depending on the variation of humors and other conditions.
Chapter XV.
On the fracture of the knee joint.
The knee joint is rarely subject to fracture, but it may be bruised frequently; if a fracture does occur, it is either a tear or a dislocation of its parts, with or without a wound.
All of this must be done by touch, and it should be reduced by gently manipulating the separated parts with the fingers until they come together and heal, according to what is possible with skill, caution, and precision. Then, a bandage should be applied and a rounded splint should be used if necessary.
The tension should be tightened according to the appropriate tension, and then all conditions described for other fractures, such as hot swelling and so on, should be treated by addressing each occurrence with what is suitable until healing occurs.
Chapter XVI.
On the reduction of a leg fracture.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the shin bone, and the other thin, called the fibula, and they suffer from types of fractures similar to those of the arm bones. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is one and the same. If both bones are broken, the leg turns in all directions. If the thinner bone breaks, the leg turns forward. If the thicker bone breaks from below, this is clear to you.
Therefore, use extension and compression, and apply splints accordingly, except that if the leg fracture is severe with numerous fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and be careful in its treatment.
In the leg, there is an additional step in the process: if you have finished adjusting the splints and all your work, take two strips of pine wood used for flattening rooms placed between board gaps, or palm frond papers, or similar.
Select strips that are slightly thick and not too thin, with a length corresponding to the leg from the knee to below. Then, wrap each one with two turns of cloth along its length, placing one on the inside and another on the outside of the leg.
These should extend from the knee to below the foot, and then tie the strips in three places on each side and in the middle. With this strapping, the leg is prevented from tilting right or left and is shaped well. A wooden splint of corresponding length along the leg can also be used.
And it should be placed to preserve it from movement, and this is most necessary in the case of a fracture with a special wound, then inspect the leg every day and take care of it carefully regarding swelling or puffiness or any other issues. If such a thing happens, treat it as necessary until it heals, and the leg bone will heal in about thirty days or so.
Chapter XVII
On the fracture of leg and finger bones.
As for the heel, it never suffers a fracture, while the leg bones can suffer fractures, and the fingers even less often, as they are more susceptible to bruising in most cases.
If a leg bone suffers a fracture and you see that the bones have shifted, the patient should put their foot on the ground straight like walking, then you place your foot on the elevated bone and press it down, smoothing it out.
Until they return to their proper positions, then take the dressing and bandage, placing a small board with two flat ends under the foot, after wrapping it with cloth and using all necessary materials.
If three or four days have passed, then release the bandage. You will find the bones either levelled after being broken, or reunited after having been separated. The procedure is as you see fit. If some of the fingers are broken, set them and straighten them according to the method described for setting the fingers of the hand.
Then, make a splint for the broken finger that extends along the finger and is slightly wider, then place this board beneath the foot as described to you and secure it tightly. If the broken bones number two, three, or more.
Make a splint for each finger, graded in size and placed in a soft cloth, then secure the board at the bottom of the foot. Let each head of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to ensure proper adjustment.
You must not forget to attend to all that has been mentioned for the various types of fractures, and meet each condition with what is appropriate.
Chapter XVIII
In this chapter, the text discusses fractures specific to women (fractures of the hip and pubic bone) and men (fractures of the groin area).
When the vagina of a woman is fractured, have her sit up and then gently bend her towards her back. The midwife should grasp her from behind and insert cotton into the vagina until it fills and becomes shaped like a ball within her.
Then the woman should be shaken and her body slightly raised, so that this cotton comes out little by little until it becomes like a ball at the entrance of the vulva and the bone fracture heals. Then she should put a pad on her back. Whenever she wants to urinate, she should remove the cotton gently.
Then return it to the position you initially placed it, and go back to your first pad. Do this for about seven days or so, and it will heal. If you wish to use a goat's bladder, tighten a tube around its opening, insert the entire bladder through her vulva.
Then blow into the tube strongly, so that the bladder inside the vulva expands. The fracture will heal. Then stuff it with cotton and maintain this position for several days as described until it heals. For a broken pubic bone in men or women, this method can also be used for healing.
You should treat it as we described for the hip bone; the correct approach is evident to anyone familiar with this rare type of fracture, especially those with some experience and understanding of this book. The fracture itself often provides clues in most cases.
Follow the correct procedure for its repair and stabilization. If a man's penis fractures, insert a piece of an ostrich's throat into it, then place a wrap of cloth around it, secure it, and leave it for about three days or so until it heals.
Chapter XIX.
In bone fracture reduction when accompanied by a wound.
For anyone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large such as the femur, ulna, or similar, one should act promptly to reduce the fracture as soon as the conditions for reduction are met, as we have previously discussed.
If the wound is bleeding, one should promptly apply crushed ash to stop the bleeding, if none is available, and then proceed with reducing the fracture on that same day, without delaying.
If a hot swelling does not occur, but a warm one does, leave the reduction until the ninth day, so that the warm swelling subsides, and do not touch it on the third and fourth days, for it will then manifest bad symptoms.
If the fractured bone is exposed through the skin, one should attempt to reduce and set it with their hands gently and a slight pull, but if this is not possible, use this tool, which is made of iron, about seven or eight fingers long. And position it according to the size of the wound.
Therefore, the surgeon should choose three or four, according to the need for treatment in each type of fracture, and they should be rounded with a slight thickness to prevent them from bending when pressure is applied during surgery.
It should have a sharp point with a bend at the tip, and the upper part should be thick, while the lower half is very thin, and this is its appearance: .
It is called in Greek "perim" meaning a small hook, and it should be used to bend the sharp end onto the edge of the bone fragment, then push with one swift motion to realign the broken bones. Once some stability is achieved, a file can be used to smooth out the edges of the fracture.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, one should cut off the end of the bone so that the tool can grasp it. If the bone cannot be aligned as described above, then it should be cut with a similar cutting tool mentioned earlier.
Or use a saw to cut it as best you can, then remove any remaining roughness and thin layers from the bone. If, after realigning the bone, the patient experiences severe pain, indicating that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can successfully realign the bone to its natural position, you will greatly benefit the patient. Once the bone healing is complete, dip a cloth in a contracting, black, special solution, especially during summer, and do not place any bandages or greasy substances on the wound.
To prevent putrefaction and corruption, then use bindings when you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound exposed by making a hole in the bandages with scissors, proportionate to the size of the wound.
And be extremely careful not to tighten the wound with the fracture, for this has often been done by ignorant physicians, causing either death, gangrene, or a severe cold. Let your tightening be gentle and relaxing, contrary to the tightness of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or it is a large wound and you fear some of the adverse symptoms we described, and there is pain in the area that is disturbing, then do not apply bindings to it, and make for it bandages from strong cloth in the place of the bindings and tighten it with these.
Then, after a day or two, if you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth with which it was covered using a drink (presumably a liquid), then use ligatures and ointments as we usually treat wounds, such as the quadriple ointment and similar ones. You should also loosen the binding.
Examine the wound every morning and evening until it heals, and you should position the limb so that the pus can drain easily downwards. If many days pass and the wound does not close, and the pus does not stop, then know that there are small fragments of bone.
It is necessary to examine the wound with a probe. If any of the fragments are protruding, extract and remove them. If some are not protruding but press on the member and cause pain, crush and extract them in every way you can.
If the wound presents a cold, inflammation, or any other form of corruption and putrefaction, it is necessary to apply to each of these manifestations the corresponding treatment described in its chapter.
And among what you should pay attention to and keep in mind: if a large bone breaks and is pressed against a member, such as the femur, ulna, or other large members, do not attempt to pull it out or remove it. Often, this leads to death. Leave it until it putrefies; perhaps it will fall off on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then, treat the wound if you see a place for treatment, otherwise leave it be.
Chapter Twenty.
On the treatment of complications that occur as a result of some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially near joints, disfiguring the member and possibly preventing it from performing its natural function.
If the swelling is soft, use drugs that contract, such as frankincense, myrrh, gallnut, asafoetida, and acacia, either alone or in combination, mixed with a contracting drink, egg white, or vinegar.
If the swelling is hard, apply pressure in a firm manner and maintain it for several days without releasing it, then release it and reapply pressure as needed until the swelling subsides, or use a tight plate of lead.
Lead has the property to dissolve all that forms in the members. If the swelling has become hardened, and pressure makes it necessary to remove it, make a cut from above and remove the resulting fragment or scrape it with scissors until it disappears, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the treatment of fractures, if the bone heals straight and remains soft, unlike its original state.
If a bone fracture heals with the member remaining soft and weak, it may be due to numerous reasons. One of the reasons is either loosening the ligatures excessively and binding them improperly, or over-tightening the ligatures to the extent that nutrition is blocked from reaching the member, or excessive rest, or inappropriate movements at the wrong time, or lack of blood in the patient's body and its weakness.
Treatment for this includes nourishing the patient, enriching his body until blood increases within it, using baths, and bringing joy and happiness to him, then applying pitch to the affected area to attract a great deal of nourishment to it or prolong its healing with warm water. until it absorbs the nourishment and returns to its natural state.
Chapter Twenty-Second.
In the treatment of broken bones that are bent and prevented from functioning as they should.
When a member that has been set after its deformation or the curve or complication of the broken bone has healed, and as a result, the shape of the member is distorted. Except if the member continues to perform its natural function, one should not accept the claim of those who assert that the member must be broken from the head, as many ignorant doctors and carpenters in our country have done so.
This action is highly condemned and leads to great danger; its least consequence is injury. However, if the deformity and complication are still fresh, it should be bathed in water heated with relaxing herbs such as spinach leaves, nettle roots, and laurel crown, among others.
It is treated with soothing astringents such as well-made diachylon, or saliva from the root of the plant is mixed with chicken fat and sheep tallow and applied as a poultice, or ripe figs are pounded with pigeon droppings and other drugs known as fibrin dissolvers.
The clot dissolves with gentle, continuous friction applied by the hands, and the movement of the affected part is utilized at all times. If the deformity has become advanced, severe, and rigid, and requires treatment with iron.
It is necessary to make an incision above it, release the attachment of the bone, and cut what remains of the clot or bone with delicate cuts, using gentleness and care in this process. Then, treat the wound as mentioned earlier until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The mandible, when it deviates from its joint and moves out of place, obstructs movement, disfigures the member, and causes severe pain and suffering to the patient. Therefore, as soon as any deviation in one of the jaws occurs, it is necessary to promptly restore it to its proper position.
It should not be delayed at all, for if swelling makes it difficult to return the jaw to its proper position, then the delay will cause spasms and severe pain for the patient. Therefore, one should not delay or move or stretch it during the time of its swelling.
However, if this occurs, one should promptly proceed to drain the patient's illness, then leave until the swelling subsides somewhat, after which the affected member is bathed with hot water and fat, then returned gently, and each member is treated as mentioned in its respective place.
The chapters on the jaw have also been arranged according to the preceding discussion of fractures, from the upper part of the body to its lower parts.
Chapter XXIV
In the treatment of the lower jaw (fissure of the mandible).
It is rare that the jaws become completely dislodged, and their detachment occurs in one of two ways: either they move slightly out of place, relaxing somewhat, or they are completely and totally dislodged, also resulting in relaxation. It is directed towards the chest, causing the patient to drool and unable to hold it or close their jaw, with their tongue twisting during speech. If the dislocation is minor, in most cases, it may return on its own with minimal effort.
If the dislocation is complete, one must urgently proceed to reduce it and not delay under any circumstances. The attendant should hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert one thumb into the origin of the jaw within the mouth, if it is on one side.
If both thumbs enter from both sides of the jaw, and all other fingers are placed externally to adjust it, he orders the patient to relax his jaw and release it so that it goes in every direction. The doctor adjusts the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.
If the jaw is difficult to move, especially if both jaws are involved, use a hot water compress with fat until they become easier to move. Do not delay their movement as we have said. If they return and align, and the patient's mouth closes without relaxing, then place strips of cloth, made from wax and fat, on them.
Then, bind them gently with a loose bandage. The patient should sleep on their back with their head raised on two pillows to prevent any movement to the right or left and avoid chewing. Keep their food soft.
Until the pain goes away and the jaw heals, he may eat as he wishes but should do so gently, without straining to open his mouth while eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw recovers fully.
If the jaw does not return to its place when it becomes unstuck and fails to heal, it often leads to fever, constant headaches, and sometimes abdominal pain and vomiting. If these symptoms occur, know that the condition is severe.
And often, he dies within ten days of being exposed to it.
Chapter Twenty-Fifth.
In the reduction of the collarbone and the acromion.
As for the collarbone, it does not separate from the inside due to its connection to the chest, but it can separate outwardly, which is evident to the touch. It must be reduced by having the patient lie on their back and extend their arms.
Then, you press the area with the palm of your hand firmly, and it will return. Next, apply a bandage and splints and tighten them. The end of the collarbone that connects to the shoulder does not dislocate except rarely. If it does dislocate, it should be reduced and aligned as we have mentioned and as is suitable for you.
Then, apply a bandage and splints and tighten them. You must order the patient to remain still and at rest until they recover. With this same treatment, the end of the shoulder will also be reduced if it becomes dislocated again.
Chapter Twenty-Sixth.
In Treating Dislocations of the Shoulder Joint.
Know that the shoulder joint dislocates in three ways: towards the armpit downward, towards the chest, and in rare cases, upwards over the shoulder.
It does not dislocate backward to the position of the shoulder or forward to the position of the nerve; most commonly, it dislocates downward towards the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, as it exits and re-enters quickly.
On the other hand, for those with abundant flesh, it is quite the opposite; it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty. Sometimes, a person might suffer a blow or fall, causing the shoulder joint to swell with hot inflammation, leading one to believe that it has dislocated; therefore, it should be examined to confirm its condition.
Then, you should proceed with its treatment. You can distinguish the dislocated joint by comparing the affected shoulder to the healthy one; you will notice a clear difference, and upon touching, the head of the shoulder bone feels like a chicken egg beneath the armpit.
The patient cannot raise their hand to their ear or move it normally; likewise, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, this will be clearly visible to anyone examining it.
And if the jaw is soft or the patient is a child, it can be returned to its place by having a servant raise his hand above, then you place your thumbs under the armpit and lift the joint forcefully upward to its position, and the servant raises his hand and extends it upward.
Then, if it is lowered gently, it will return quickly. If it does not return as mentioned and the jaw has been affected for a long time, the patient should take a hot bath and use relaxants that soften the joints, such as cooking the roots of fennel, dill, and rosemary in water.
Then the patient should lie on his back, and place a woolen ball under his armpit, moderate between hardness and softness. The physician then places their weight on the ball and holds the patient's hand, extending it downwards.
And by pushing the ball with his foot, it will return to its original position. If you prefer, you can do this by bringing a taller man who stands on one side of the patient and places his elbow under the patient's armpit, raising the armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. Another servant pulls the patient's hand towards his lower abdomen. If the patient is light in build, a weight should be tied to them to make them heavier, and the jaw will return to its place immediately. It may also be corrected using another method.
It is to focus on the ground a long wooden beam whose head is round like a pestle, neither thick nor thin, and then place it under the armpit of the patient after placing a soft cloth over the head of the beam while the patient stands along the length of the beam.
Then he extends his hand downwards on the other side and also extends his body from the other side with force, so the joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to return it using all that has been mentioned, use this treatment: take a beam whose length is about two arms' length. It should be four fingers in width and two fingers in thickness, with a round head to easily enter the armpit as shown.
Then tie a soft cloth over the round head to prevent any harm to the beam, place it under the armpit, extend the whole hand and arm downwards on the beam, and bind the beam to the upper arm, forearm, and wrist.
Then the arm is placed on a support. Place your hand on it and extend it downwards, while leaving the rest of the body hanging from the other side. The joint will enter of its own accord at that time. If it enters in any way possible, place a moderate-sized ball of wool under the armpit.
Then take the prepared bandage made from flour mixed with resin and egg white, apply it to the entire shoulder as it is rolled over, and tightly secure the ball under the armpit. The bandage is then wrapped on top of it and the hand is hung around the neck.
And he should keep the hand immobile for seven days, and the food of the patient should be reduced so that the member gains strength, thus accelerating its healing. Then, after seven or five days, it is trained through movement. If it holds firm and does not relax, it has healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to moisture or another condition, it is necessary to use cauterization with three sapphires, as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization. If you do all this and loosen the bandage after seven days, but the joint does not hold firm.
If you repeat the binding and tightening but it does not hold firm, falls, and cannot be raised back up, then know that the nerve in the shoulder joint has either been cut, stretched, or relaxed. At this point, understand that the joint will never remain stable in its place.
Regarding the jaw that is positioned towards the chest and breasts, and moves backward with a push and stretch of the hands, it should be manipulated through all forms of pulling and treatment until it heals. If, after healing, it shows signs of weakness in the member and movement is delayed, then it should be re-examined.
The patient should use the bath frequently until the weakness in the member subsides and it returns to its original state.
Chapter XXVII.
In the treatment of the dislocation of the shoulder joint.
The shoulder joint dislocates with difficulty and returns with difficulty, moving in all directions, especially forward or backward. Its dislocation is evident to the eye and palpable to the touch, revealing its shape.
When you compare the dislocated joint with the healthy one, you will notice a distinct indentation, preventing the arm from bending and the shoulder from moving. You must act swiftly to reduce the dislocation before it develops into a severe inflammation.
If it develops into a hot swelling, reducing it becomes difficult, and in some cases, it may never heal completely, especially if the dislocation is backward. This type of dislocation is the most severe and painful, often leading to death.
If it is possible to reduce the dislocation, have the patient extend both hands and arms fully, while the surgeon places one hand above and the other below the joint, using the thumbs or the palm's base to push the joint back into its socket.
For a forward dislocation, try bending the hand once, striking the acromion (the bone at the top of the shoulder blade) with the palm. If this does not reduce the dislocation, apply extreme force by having two assistants extend the arm fully.
The patient also has two helpers so that he does not slip at the moment of tension, then the arm is turned in all directions after it is wrapped with a folded cloth or a wide bandage, and if the doctor begins to treat the joint with his hands, he smooths them with oil to facilitate the movement of the joint.
Then, the joint is pushed firmly until it returns, and after its return, the dressing that includes compression and drying with egg white should be applied tightly and the arm should be suspended from the patient's neck, leaving it for several days.
Then, check it; if the joint stabilizes in its place, release the bandage and leave it. If you see that the joint does not improve as expected, reapply the dressing and bandage and leave it for a few more days until it strengthens, then release it. If any pain occurs after the joint's return and its release.
If there is difficulty in movement, use moisture in a bath and gentle massage and stimulation until it softens, or place a thin sheep's bladder over the joint, then bind it and leave it for a day and night, then remove it and immerse it in a bath; if it sweats, carefully rub the joint.
Then, repeat the application of the bladder once, twice, and three times while immersing it in a bath until it softens; if you prefer, apply wet, diluted cow manure with butter and tighten it; do this several times, as it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight
In the treatment of wrist dislocation.
The wrist joint is often dislocated and its reduction is more difficult than other joints, except that it should be reduced immediately upon dislocation to prevent the formation of a hard lump or swelling.
Its reduction involves placing the patient's wrist on a board, having a helper extend the patient's hand, and the physician applying pressure on the joint to return it, while ensuring that the dislocation has moved back to its proper position in the palm.
The patient should place the palm of their hand on the board during both extension and flexion, if the dislocation is visible on the palm, they should rest their back hand on the board, allowing the physician's hand to access the same joint surface. If it reduces immediately, apply a compressive bandage to manage swelling.
Allow the reduction to heal without further intervention, as it may not be possible to reduce it again after several days. The joint's position will remain corrected and the patient should avoid straining their hand, ensuring they can still grip objects.
If the nerve has been damaged or there is severe trauma, there is little that can be done except to apply heat therapy, which may or may not help. Once the wrist is reduced, apply the compressive dressing and keep it in place for five days.
Then, if the hand becomes rigid and any impurity appears in it, soften it with warm water and massage it several times until it becomes flexible.
Chapter Twenty-Nine
On the Treatment of Dislocated Joints
If a finger is dislocated and turns in any direction, such that it points to the palm or the back of the hand, stretch the finger and push the joint with your thumb until it returns to its place. Then bind the top of the finger and hang it towards the side it turned to.
Leave it for two days, then release it and stretch it until it becomes straight. If it's at night, tie it as described before. Continue to loosen it during the day, move it, and re-tie it at night, doing this for several days until it strengthens.
Similarly, if a finger turns inward towards the palm of the hand, tie it in the same way as described, and follow these steps until it heals. The same applies if it turns in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty
In the treatment of a spinal disc herniation.
When a spinal or cervical disc completely separates or many discs shift from their positions, treatment is not possible as death approaches the patient rapidly.
A sign of this is that the patient's faeces are released involuntarily, they are unable to control them, and sometimes their legs or arms, or one of them, weaken. If just one disc shifts from its position, it often moves completely.
If a disc shifts to any of four directions, it is either called a hunch or a curve. Its treatment involves observation; if the curve occurred during childhood, there is no cure and it will never rectify. However, if it resulted from a fall or a blow, etc., then treatment may be considered.
He has described them [the treatments] in detail, but most of it is not beneficial. I have summarized what is useful from his explanations and descriptions, and depicted the instruments differently than he did.
I say that the hunch occurring at the front in the chest, or on either side, offers no cure and will not rectify itself. However, the one that happens in the back can be treated by positioning the patient face down.
On a flat surface near a wall, lay a damp cloth beneath to prevent injury to the chest. Then place a standing wooden pole embedded in a hole in the ground at one end of the surface near his head, and another wood at the other end of the table near his feet.
And a servant should hold the pole, not fixed in the hole, and another holds the other in this manner, then wrap around the chest of the patient and under his armpits with soft cloth and extend the cloth's end to the pole by his head and tie it there.
Then secure another cloth over his hips and above his knees and at his ankles, and gather all the ties and bind them to the other pole by his feet, then each servant extends the pole with its bindings towards their respective sides without moving the poles from their positions.
Except that they are not fixed as we said, and the physician places his hands on the pole with force until it returns, or he places a board on top of it and leans on the board with his legs until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, take a board that is about three arms long.
Dig a place in the wall that we mentioned should be near the patient, where the end of the board can enter. Then place the middle of the board on the hump and the physician places his legs on the other end, and tighten it firmly until it compresses the pole.
Return it to its place, and if you wish to make it with a spiral twisted by hand, it is to drive two wooden sticks into the ground at the head of the patient on the far end of the bed, each with a length of an arm, and also at his feet on the same end of the bed, two more wooden sticks.
And after this, between each stick, a space of one span should be left, and in each stick a hole made, through which the spiral passes, and all the sticks are firmly fixed into the ground so that they do not move at all; then a round stick is inserted, which is the spiral on which the ligature is wound in the holes of both sticks.
At the end of it, a hole is made in which a stick one span long, twisted, is inserted; and likewise in the other two sticks. Then the ligature previously fastened on the chest of the patient is wound around the spiral at his head, and the ligatures on his legs are wound around the spirals at his feet.
Then, at each spiral, a servant stands who twists his hand with the instrument that winds the spiral, while the doctor adjusts the hump as previously described. This is an illustration of the spiral, bed, and patient: .
Then, after the spine returns to its place and the position is levelled, the dry bandage made from egg white should be applied, followed by a compress, and then a splint placed on top of the bandage, with a width of three fingers or slightly more, and a length that corresponds to the position of the hump.
And upon some correct seeds, then bind with the ribbon that is due, and let the patient use the delicate food until he recovers. If there remains some protrusion in the place at the end of recovery, then it is necessary to use medications that relax and soften, along with the board that we have described for a long time.
And in that, a lead plate may be used, and there may be a protrusion in the last seeds of the spine, leading one to think it is dislocated, and this could be an extra bone that has grown, so do not subject it to this treatment, as it might cause death.
Chapter 31.
On the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the elbow joint only suffer dislocation, not the decay or deformation that occurs in other joints. The hip joint can be dislocated in four ways.
This is because the hip joint can dislocate towards the inside, outside, front, or back, but most often it dislocates towards the inside, and rarely towards the front or back. The sign of dislocation towards the inside is that if you compare the healthy leg to the affected leg, the latter appears shorter.
The knee is bent more than it should be, and the patient cannot flex their leg at the thigh. The area following the thigh is clearly swollen, indicating that the top of the femur has moved there.
And the sign that the jaw deviates outward presents symptoms opposite to these symptoms; and when the jaw deviates forward, it straightens the leg completely, except that he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he tries to walk, he is unable to do so forward.
He experiences difficulty urinating, his thigh is stiff, and when walking, he bears weight on the heel. The sign of a jaw deviation to the rear is that he cannot straighten the knee or bend it without first bending the thigh, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
The thigh is relaxed, and the head of the femur is visible in the hip socket. As for the correction of this type of jaw, if it is old and has been associated with its owner and has not attempted to return to its normal position, it will not be treated at all.
You should not attempt to treat it, except for a recent jaw fracture from any of the four types of fractures; in that case, immediately manipulate the joint, flex and extend it, and move it right and left, as it may heal.
Return and do not require other treatment, if it does not return in this way, then you should consider a strong helper who extends his leg from below with his hands or a cloth tied above the knee on his leg, and another assistant extends him from above.
Then let him insert his hands from under his armpits, tighten a soft cloth at the base of the thigh, and another assistant, a third, holds the end of the cloth, extending it either from the front, from the groin to the shoulder blade, or from behind, towards the back.
They should all be extended at once until the patient raises his body from the ground and remains suspended, for this type of extension is common to all four. If the jaw returns as we have said, otherwise each type requires the specific treatment I have mentioned.
As for its specific return, if the jaw is pushed in, the patient should lie on his right side, then a cloth should be wrapped around the base of the thigh between the head of the femur and the point below the groin.
Then the bandage is extended upwards from the groin to the upper body, towards the shoulder blade, and another strong assistant with his arms wraps around the thick part of the thigh of the patient and extends it outward with a powerful pull, causing it to return to its place.
And this type is easier than all other types of treatment that aim to restore this member, if it is impossible for you or it does not respond to this type of treatment at all, then you should bind both legs of the patient with a strong and flexible bandage on the ankles and knees.
And each one should be at a distance from the other equal to four fingers, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by two fingers, then the patient is hung on a wooden beam in the house at a distance from the ground of two arms' length.
Then you command a strong boy to embrace the thigh and another boy attaches himself to the patient, while another boy pushes the one embracing the thigh with force; then the joint will return to its place quickly. If, however, the jaw is pushed outward, its return to its proper position will be slower.
The patient should lie on a couch as described for the hunchback, with the affected leg particularly bound, and his chest bound as well. Then place one wooden beam at his feet and another at his head, and add an additional beam in the middle of the couch, secured very tightly.
A damp cloth should be wrapped around it to prevent injury, with the beam between his thighs to prevent him from sinking downward during the tidal pull. Then each assistant extends towards their side, while the doctor adjusts the hip with his hands; if it returns to its place, then it has responded successfully.
And if it is necessary to dislocate the bone, place a board on it and press as we have mentioned for the curvature, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side. If the dislocation is towards the front, stretch the patient's leg once while he remains in this position.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the diseased thigh and presses with his left hand, extending the pressure downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is towards the rear, the patient should not extend their leg downwards.
It should be elevated above the ground, placed on a solid surface, and the patient's hip joint should be dislocated outward, as we have mentioned regarding his position on the board with the ligaments tightened.
As we have mentioned above, the board should be used for compression on the area where the joint has dislocated. Once the hip joint returns to its proper position, as it should, and its return is evident, the patient will extend their leg.
If you see both leg and foot in their natural position, the patient can contract and extend their leg without difficulty, then know that the joint has returned to its proper place. At this point, align the thighs and carry out the bandaging, securing it tightly with a wrap that does not allow the hip to move in any direction.
The patient must rest for three or four days, then the bandage and dressing are removed, and the leg is measured against the other. If they appear equal in length, know that the fracture has healed, so release the patient to walk; if there is still some relaxation observed.
Then return and dress it and bind it as you did initially, leaving it for three more days, then release it and let him walk slowly on it for some days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter II and III.
In the treatment of the knee joint.
The knee joint dislocates in three ways: towards the inside, outside, and downwards (i.e., behind), but never forward. The indication of its dislocation is to order the patient to bring his leg towards his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. To reduce it, sit the patient down with his legs extended if he can bear that, and have a servant sit behind him, gripping his midsection and gently leaning him back slightly, then sit on his thighs.
Press your back against his face, position his leg between your legs, then place both hands on his knee, interlocking your fingers over it. Then, with firm pressure from your hands, and help from another assistant extending his leg, the knee should return to its proper position.
Sign of its healing is when the leg adheres to the thigh in a soft, non-forced manner, then bandage it and attach the leg to the thigh, then bind them all with a bandage for three or four days, and then release them, and use only a little walking for several days until it strengthens.
If it is not possible for it to heal as described, then use the strong tension with bandages that we have described in the treatment of the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In the treatment of the ankle joint.
The ankle may heal slightly or completely detach, and its dislocation is either towards the inside or outside. The sign of its dislocation is that you can see the ankle swelling and protruding to the side it has moved towards.
As for the treatment of its detachment, it is easy to reduce it by gently pulling with the hands until it returns. However, if it detaches completely, the patient should sit down and a strong servant should hold them from behind, in the middle of their back, to help them heal.
Then, hold the patient's foot with your right hand at the top and your left hand at the bottom, near the ankle. Pull the foot towards you with your right hand twice, then extend it with your left hand, gently pushing the foot's front towards the thigh without force.
Make these two movements as described, then in the third movement, push the foot forward onto the leg while pulling on the ankle. If it returns once or twice in this way and you observe the foot to be level, otherwise repeat the procedure.
If, after making the movements described, the foot does not return to its place as expected, place the patient face down on the ground and insert a peg firmly into the earth between his legs, wrapping cloth around it to prevent injury to the patient. Then, have an assistant hold the patient's thigh.
Then, another assistant extends the patient's leg with his hands or a strap tied around the patient's neck, extending it against the direction of the first leg and the peg holding the legs apart. The surgeon then adjusts the jaw with his hands.
Another assistant holds the healthy leg down, and if the jaw returns to its place quickly, take up the bandage and splint, binding them tightly, and secure the foot with a strap towards the sole, being careful of the nerve above the heel from behind.
To prevent the strap from being too tight and causing injury, leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it again, and then release it on the fourth day or after 40 days, after which the patient is prevented from walking.
If one attempts to walk before this period, there is a risk that the jaw will dislocate and become damaged, and subsequent treatment will not be effective. If a hot lump appears, one should use the remedies we have described in various sections of treatment and immobilization until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
In the treatment of a man's finger dislocation.
One should adjust the displaced bones using a slight stretch, without force, which is easy to do. If the dislocation is in one of the toes, the patient should place their foot on a level surface.
Or, while the patient stands on a board, you should place your foot on the displaced joint and then press down firmly with your other foot until it aligns and appears level.
Then, place a board under the sole of the patient's foot, covering the entire foot with two ends, and secure it tightly for three days. Release it and protect it from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are confident that it will not reoccur, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
In Types of Mandible with Wound or Fracture or Both.
When such things occur, whether it be a wound or fracture or both, the treatment and reduction of the mandible is often followed by death.
Therefore, one should not undertake such treatment unless they are skilled in the craft, experienced, delicate, compassionate, patient, and cautious, and start with only cooling drugs to alleviate the heat of the wound, leaving the patient in care.
For Allah's sake, unless you pray for safety from harm with a light illness and see some hope of recovery, do not delay in returning it to its place at the first sign of heat inflammation.
If the organ returns as you intended, use measures to alleviate heat inflammation and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments. If the mandible is fractured and there are protruding bone fragments, they should be removed by forceps. Follow this with the same treatment as mentioned for simple diseases in their respective sections.
Exert your utmost effort and purify yourself from venturing into uncertain paths, as I have advised you; this will preserve your honor and protect your dignity, if Allah wills.
