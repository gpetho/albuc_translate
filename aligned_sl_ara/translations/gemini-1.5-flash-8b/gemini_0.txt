The author of this book, having completed for you, my children, this book, which is a complete part of the science of medicine, and having reached its peak in clarity and explanation, has seen fit to complete it for you with this chapter, which is a part of practical application.
Because practical application in our land and in our time is entirely lacking, so much so that its science almost ceased to be studied and its influence disappeared. And only a few traces remained in the books of the ancients, which hands have distorted and error and confusion have affected, so that their meanings became obscure and their benefits distant.
Therefore, I have seen fit to revive it and compose this chapter in a way of explanation, clarification, and summarization, and to present illustrations of cautery irons and other instruments of work, as this adds to clarity and contains what is needed.
The reason there is no skilled practitioner with skillful hands in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its practitioner must first exert himself in the study of anatomy, as described by Galen. So that he may understand the benefits of the organs, their nature, temperaments, connections, and separations, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number, and origins; and the pulsating and stationary veins, and the locations of their exits.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the art of handcraft. We have mentioned a part of this in the introduction of this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable about the anatomy we have mentioned is likely to make a mistake that kills people, as I have often observed in those who presume to know and claim it without knowledge or understanding.
I saw an ignorant physician who incised a swine-like tumor on a woman's neck, severing some of the arteries of the neck.  The woman bled until she fell dead at his hands.
And I saw another physician, while attempting to remove a stone from an elderly man, who had a large stone.  He acted rashly and removed it by tearing a piece of the bladder. The man died about three days later.  I was called to remove it, and from the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I judged that I could not have done it.
And I saw another physician who made a living practicing medicine among the leading figures of our city.
A dark-skinned boy had a fractured leg near the heel, accompanied by a wound.  The physician, in his ignorance, hastily bound the fracture tightly to the wound with bandages and splints, leaving no breathing space for the wound.
Then, he left it to its own devices and neglected it for days, instructing the boy not to loosen the bandages until his leg and foot swelled up and he was close to death.
So I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandages. He found relief and his pain lessened, but the damage to the limb had already taken hold, and I was unable to reverse it.
The damage continued to spread throughout the limb until he died.
I saw another physician treat a cancerous tumor.  After a few days, it ulcerated, and the patient's suffering worsened.  This is because, if the cancer is purely black bile, it should not be treated with iron at all.
Unless it is in a limb that can be completely removed.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two categories: work that is accompanied by safety, and work that more often than not results in injury.
And I have warned, throughout this book, of every work that involves risk and fear; you must avoid and reject it.
So that the ignorant do not find a way to speak ill and criticize, take care, be cautious, and be gentle and firm in your treatment.
Employ the best path leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure diseases.
Keep yourselves away from anything that you fear might lead you into doubt regarding your religion and your worldly affairs.  This is more enduring for your reputation and raises your status in this world and the next.
Galen, in some of his precepts, said, "Do not treat a disease poorly, lest you be called a poor physician.
This article is divided into three chapters.
The first chapter.
In cauterization with fire and cauterization with sharp instruments, a categorized section from the heel to the foot, images of instruments, cautery irons, and everything necessary for manual work.
And the second chapter.
On incision, lancing, bloodletting, cupping, surgeries, removing arrows and similar procedures, all categorized and arranged, with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third chapter.
On fractures, dislocations, treatment of sprains, and similar conditions, categorized and arranged from the heel to the foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first chapter.
On cauterization.
Before mentioning its use, it is necessary to describe its benefits, harms, and the temperament in which it is used.
I say that discussing the benefits and harms of cauterization is a lengthy discourse, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and many wise men have spoken on it.
And they differed on it.  I have summarized the little that I have taken from their words for fear of being overly verbose.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for every bad temperament, with or without matter, excluding two temperaments: a hot temperament without matter, and a dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they differed on it. Some said that cauterization is beneficial in it, while others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for a disease arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured of a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry remedy.  The one who says the opposite asserts that cauterization with fire may benefit from a hot, dry disease that occurs in people's bodies. Because when you add a person's body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the person's body cold.
And I say in agreement with him, because experience has revealed this to me on numerous occasions; however, this matter should only be considered by those who have diligently practiced and trained extensively in the art of cauterization. And to understand the differences in temperaments among people, the nature of illnesses themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear of them, especially the cold, moist diseases; all physicians agree on this and do not differ about the benefit of cauterization in these cases.
Know, my children, that the secret of cauterization with fire and its superiority over cauterization with a burning medicament lies in this: fire is a simple element whose effect is limited to the specific organ cauterized.  It will not harm another adjacent organ except with slight damage.
However, cauterization with a burning medicament may extend its effect to other organs.  It might even cause an incurable disease or death in the target organ.  Fire, by virtue of its noble and pure essence, will not cause such harm unless it is overused.
This has become clear to us through long experience, careful attention to the craft, and understanding the facts of the matter.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy explanation.  Were it not inappropriate for this book, I would have presented to you the secret and method of fire's action on the body, and its ability to cure illnesses, with a profound, logical philosophical argument that surpasses your understanding.
Know, my children, that there is disagreement concerning the optimal time for cauterization.  They consider springtime to be the best time.
I say that cauterization is suitable in every season, for any harm caused by the season is surpassed by the benefit derived from cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for a severe, urgent, and dangerous ailment that cannot tolerate delay, lest a greater calamity follow the lesser harm caused by the season.
Do not, my children, entertain the popular notions and the ignorant physicians' imaginings that a cauterization curing a disease will never return and therefore make it a detriment.
The matter is not as you suppose, for cauterization is like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries the humors, which are the cause of the ailments.
However, cauterization is superior to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
The disease may return at some time, depending on the patient's temperament, the strength and severity of the illness, the confluence of factors within the body, and neglect of proper diet and other contributing factors.
Unless the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild one in an organ with few humors and moisture. For example, cauterizing a tooth for pain, and similar cases, that pain may not return, and this will be, at the least, the case.
And as for the common saying that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, it is a correct statement, not in the sense they suppose, because they believe that no remedy, whether medicinal or otherwise, can be of benefit after cauterization. The matter is otherwise.
Rather, the meaning of "cauterization being the last resort in medicine" is that if we have employed various treatments for a disease, and those remedies have proven ineffective, and then cauterization is used as the final measure and is successful, it is in this sense that cauterization is considered the last resort. Not in the sense understood by the common people and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients stated that cauterization with gold is superior to cauterization with iron. They said this because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its substance, and they said that the cauterized area does not suppurate; however, this is not universally true.
For I have tried it, and found that it does so in some bodies but not in others.  Cauterization with gold is better and superior to iron, as they say.  However, if you heat the gold cautery in the fire, you will not readily discern when it has been heated to the desired degree of gold's redness.
Because cold quickly affects it, and if you increase the heat, it melts in the fire and is fused, thus placing the craftsman in a laborious endeavor.  Therefore, cauterization with iron is quicker and closer to correctness for use, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections, organized from the head to the foot, so that the student may readily obtain what he desires, God willing.
Chapter One.
Cauterization of the head: One cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for excess moisture and coldness in the brain, which are the cause of headaches, frequent colds that descend from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleepiness, toothache, and sore throats. And generally, for every illness resulting from coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and stupor, and similar diseases.
The method for this cauterization is that the patient should first be induced to vomit with a purgative medicine, cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and habits.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then have him sit before you, cross-legged, with his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose, between his eyes.  Wherever your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-wood cautery, which has this form.
If the bone has been exposed to the extent of a pin's head or a lentil seed, remove your hand.  Otherwise, reheat your instrument, either the same iron or another, if it has cooled. Until you see the bone as I have described.  Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a cotton pad in it. Apply it to the area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton pad soaked in clarified butter and leave it on until the burning sensation subsides. Then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals, God willing.
They say that a wound that remains open allows pus to drain, and this is better and more beneficial.
Some have said to cauterize the skin to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the bone's thickness is burned, then to remove the burned bone, and then treat the area.
Others say that one should use a strong cautery, affecting the bone strongly enough that it falls off like a small piece of quartz or a tiny shard. They claim that this releases vapors from the head and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals.  I do not at all recommend these two types of cauterization, except perhaps for some people, and it is a risky approach.  Leaving it as it is is preferable.  With good health, a head weakens when its natural connections are broken apart, as we have seen in other parts of the body.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak.  The first type of cauterization is safer and better, in my opinion.  Use it, and you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
On cauterization of the head also.
If a chronic headache occurs throughout the head, and this affliction lasts a long time for the patient, and poultices, washes, whips, ointments, and dressings have been used, and especially if the single cauterization we described did not help, then consider... If the patient's head is strong in constitution and not weak, and he experiences severe cold, cauterize again, slightly above the first one. Then cauterize each horn of his head with a cauterization until the thickness of the skin is gone and the bone is exposed to the extent we have described. Cauterize with a cauterization on the back of his head, in the spot known as the "axe" (or "the place of the axe").  Be gentle here, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience severe pain unlike the pain of other head cauterizations; I will describe this cauterization in its place.
The cauterization instrument used for the horns and back of the head should be gentler than the one used for the middle of the head.  This is its description.
Chapter Three.
In the cauterization of the chronic sister.
If, in a fissure of the head, pain occurs with headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then have the patient vomit with drugs that cleanse the head, and use all the other treatment mentioned in the divisions of diseases. If this does not succeed, then cauterization there is in two ways. Either by cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or by iron.
As for cauterization with the burning medicine, it is that you take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides, then cut the painful area on the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space underneath the skin to accommodate the clove.
Then insert it into the skin until it disappears, then hold it firmly with firm pressure, and leave it for about fifteen hours, then remove it and take out the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then apply a dressing.
Place on it a piece of cloth dipped in oil until the area is suppurated, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you wish, you may do this with some of the burning medicines which I have given in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
And as for cauterizing it with iron, it is done in this manner: heat the cautery iron, which is of this shape:
And it is called the nail-headed cautery because its head is shaped like a nail, with some grooves and a small protuberance in the center.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron a little at a time, and the amount of skin thickness that you burn should be about half of it. And lift your hand so as not to burn the artery underneath and cause bleeding, then soak a piece of cloth in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days. Then wrap the cloth in grease, and then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this vein with the pointed knife-like part of the cautery, and protect yourself from cutting the artery in this chronic vein, especially.
Chapter Four.
Cauterizing the chronic vein.
If you have treated the vein with the previous treatments mentioned and with the treatments mentioned in the sections on diseases, and the treatment has not been effective, and you see an underlying cause that the initial cauterization with medication or cauterization with fire cannot resolve, You should heat the knife-like cautery until it whitens, after having marked the area of pain with a line half a finger's length or thereabouts.  You should hold your hand in place once, pressing firmly until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
However, you should be careful not to touch the jawbone, which moves during chewing, and burn the muscle or nerve that controls it, causing spasm.
Be cautious and watchful of the artery's bleeding after cutting it, for there is risk in severing it. Especially if one is ignorant of the procedure and has no tested experience; abandoning the practice is preferable.
The treatment of accidental bleeding from the artery will be discussed in its proper place in the book, God willing, if you perceive a condition for which this cauterization is insufficient.
If you see the patient's condition as manageable, cauterize the center of the head as described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, you can use the cauterization described in the chapter on severing arteries with the two-bladed cautery, for it is a better and more effective cauterization than this.
Fifth Chapter.
On cauterizing earaches.
If an earache occurs due to cold, and it is treated with laxatives and other treatments we have mentioned in the classification, but the pain does not subside, then cauterize with the cautery called the "point," whose image is this.
Then, after heating it, drip it around the entire ear, or around both ears if the pain is in them. Move the cauterization slightly away from the base of the ear after marking the location with ink.  The cauterization should be about ten points in each ear, or thereabouts. Then treat the areas until healed, God willing.
Chapter six.
On cauterization with the *al-laquah*.
The *al-laquah* that is treated with cauterization is of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
One should avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you have treated this type of *al-laquah* with poultices, cupping, and gargles, and your treatment has been unsuccessful, then the afflicted person should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the temple, and the third at the juncture of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the afflicted area, because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization should be done in the following way:  A cauterization should be made opposite the upper part of the ear, slightly below the temple, and another one on the temple.  The length of each should be the length of a thumb.
Lower your cautery hand until you burn through about half the thickness of the skin.  This is a picture of the cautery iron; it is a type of scalpel, similar to the one previously described, but slightly milder, as you can see. The knife should have a slight excess of thickness, then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On cauterization of chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and you have treated it as we have described, and your treatment is unsuccessful, and there is no fever in the patient, cauterize four times. One cauterization on each temple, one cauterization in the middle of the head as we mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head, as previously described.
The method of cauterization as previously mentioned.  A cauterization on the mouth of the stomach may also be performed, which is more effective, then treat as previously described.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterizing forgetfulness.
The one that originates from phlegm should first be given to the patient large emetics and purgatives to purify the brain.
Then, his entire head should be shaved, and a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on dressings, should be applied to his back repeatedly, for it is a form of cauterization.
And do this according to the same method I mentioned there. If he recovers, do nothing more; otherwise, cauterize him with three cauteries on the back of his head, arranged in a line from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
Place a finger's width between each cauterization. Then treat the cauterization as previously described. If you wish to add more, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you wish to add more, cauterize on the temples. Then treat him until he recovers, and the cauterization should be olive-shaped, in the manner previously mentioned.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterization for paralysis and general relaxation of the body.
You should first cleanse the head with the poultices and as we have described, then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize a mark in the middle of the head, a mark on each temple, and a mark on the back of the head.
And three on the cervical vertebrae; if, in a case of relaxation of the body, more than this is needed, and the patient is able to tolerate it and the illness is severe and entrenched, cauterize four marks on the vertebrae of his back. Cauterize deeply until most of the skin is burned, then raise your hand, and then treat it as previously mentioned until he is healed, God willing.  The cautery should be olive oil.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is due to phlegm should be cauterized.  First, his brain should be cleansed with large cupping glasses and by all the other treatments we have mentioned in the divisions, if the patient is large and can tolerate taking medications.
However, if it is a child who cannot tolerate medications, he should use gargles and mouthwashes to cleanse the brain many days beforehand, while also improving his diet.
Then shave his head, then cauterize him once in the center of the head, as previously described in the description, and another cauterization on his back of the head. And on each temple of his head a cauterization.  If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize him with the cauterizations that were mentioned in the case of paralysis and bodily relaxation, on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back, and the cautery should be olive-colored, following the description previously given.
If the patient is a child, make the cauterization gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humours and thick phlegm, cauterize him with the cauterizations that we have described in the case of paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess of black bile, and the patient's body is moist, purge what will cleanse his brain, as previously described in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of linen like a circle, then place it on the centre of his head. The patient sits upright, holding it from each side. Then take one pound of aged sheep's butter.
Then heat it on the fire to a moderate heat, such that the finger can tolerate it if inserted.  Then pour it into the circle on the centre of his head, and leave it until it cools. Do this to the patient every week, along with good general management, until he is healed, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, scattered burns, without holding the cautery in your hand, but rather by waving it; for this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a linen cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat to him.
Chapter twelve.
On cauterizing water that flows from the eye.
If you ascertain the presence of water flowing from the eye by the signs mentioned in the classification, then immediately apply remedies to cleanse the head and protect it from all moisture, and sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of the head, and cauterize twice on the temples, if the water is flowing from both eyes, or from one side if it is in one eye only.
Then, using the cautery, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin.  Let the cauterizations be lengthwise and across the temples, and take precautions to prevent bleeding.
If you see anything of it, cut it at the site with whatever treatment you can manage.  We will discuss in wisdom the art of cutting the arteries and avoiding bleeding.
And cauterize twice deeply at the back of the head, under the bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
In cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and originate from veins and arteries on the surface of the head, externally, and you are certain that this is due to excessive cold, thick, phlegmatic matter, cauterize it with the cautery that I have described at the beginning of the descending water. One cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on each temple, and two cauteries at the back of the head under the bones. If further cauterization is needed, cauterize on each side of the eye's tear duct at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
In cauterizing foul-smelling nose.
If treatment with what we have mentioned in the classification is unsuccessful, then quickly remove the patient's crusts for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle cautery with the olive oil cautery iron. Then cauterize with the nail cautery iron two cauteries above the eyebrows, slightly under the hair.  Avoid the artery; do not cut it.  This is the image of the nail cautery iron.
Chapter Fifteen.
In cauterizing relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid is relaxed due to disease or moisture, cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery using this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows, two cauteries on each side, spaced apart from the temples, and the length of each cautery should be the length of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the cauterization, but only to the extent that one-third of the skin is burnt.  And the image of the cautery iron should be of this form.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If the eyelashes turn inward and injure the eye, then the cauterization has two types. Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a burning medicine.  As for cauterizing it with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to remove his eyelashes if he is one who plucks them, until they are long and even.
If it has injured him when they are growing, bind his eyes with a bandage so they do not move until they grow.  Once they have grown and become even, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of a leaf of a date palm.
Start the mark near the eyelashes, then place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a lizard under the eyelid.  Then heat an iron, this is its form.
Then cauterize it, little by little, several times, in the shape that you marked, until the surface of the skin, which is entirely in the shape of a date palm leaf, is burned.  A sign of your successful work is that you will see the eyelid has shrunk and the hair has risen from the flesh of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days, then apply a cotton pad with ghee until the scab comes off.  Then treat it with ointment until he heals, if God wills.  If any hair grows back later and the eyelid relaxes.
Then repeat the cauterization at that spot as you did initially.  If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not prick the eye.  As for cauterization with the burning medicine, tell the patient to let the eyelashes grow long and straight.
Then make a shape of a date palm leaf from paper.  Then take ordinary soap and quicklime, each weighing a dirham or so, pulverize them thoroughly.  Do this quickly so they don't dry out. Then spread some of it on the paper you shaped like a date palm leaf and place it on one or both eyelids.  Place a cotton pad soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on the medicine and press it slightly, moving it whenever the patient feels the burning of the medicine, because he finds it burning like fire.  As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger.  When the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And see if you find the eyelid has risen, as it rises when cauterized by fire or by cutting.  Otherwise, apply more medicine to the area where the medicine hasn't taken effect and hasn't blackened, until you complete your work and the eye is cauterized. Then place cotton with ghee on it to soothe the burning.
Then treat it with the palm ointment or another, until it heals.  You must be extremely careful during the procedure to prevent any medicine from falling into the eye.  If the eyelid relaxes after a few days, and you fear something like hair in the eye.
Then reapply the medicine to the relaxed area of the eyelid specifically, as you did at first, and treat it until it heals. This is a picture of a date palm leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size and age, so adjust your cauterization accordingly.  The correct method is not hidden from those who have expertise in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
Cauterization of the fistula that appears in the eye socket.
If you have treated the fistula as described in the sections on diseases, and your treatment has not been successful, then it is necessary to cauterize it in this manner.
Command the patient to place his head on your lap, and have an attendant hold his head firmly, ensuring no movement or shaking.
Then place a cotton ball moistened with egg white or the juice of the spurge plant over his eyes, then heat the cautery iron, which is depicted in this form.
It should be hollow, like a shaft of an eagle's feather from one end, the end used for cauterization. If you wish, it can be pierced on the other end, or if you wish, it can be solid, like a hot poker.  However, this hollow type is better for your work, God willing.
Then, squeeze the fistula if it is open, removing the pus and drying it, or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus.  Then, place the extremely hot cautery iron on it, holding it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And when cauterizing, move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose, so that your hand does not miss the mark or disturb the patient, and the cautery iron does not fall onto the eyelid and damage it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, then stop; otherwise, reheat the cautery iron a second time if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball with ghee and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, apply a strong, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed, and treat it as described in its section, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing the fistula, mentioned by some early writers, is to carefully cut open the fistula and then insert a thin tube, a funnel, into the opening.  This is its illustration.
Pour in molten lead weighing one dirham.  Hold the funnel firmly in your hand, ensuring the patient remains completely still so that the molten lead does not run into their eye.  It is necessary to place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
The lead will burn the fistula and cure it remarkably. If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment described, then stop.  Otherwise, the nostrils must be pierced, and the fistula returned to the nasal passage, as will be described in the specific section on that procedure.
The Eighteenth Chapter.
On cauterizing a cleft lip.
A cleft, called a fissure, often occurs in the lip, particularly in the lips of young boys.  If, after treating this cleft with the methods described in the previous sections, the treatment is unsuccessful, take a small, knife-like cautery iron and apply it in this way.
Make its [the cautery's] cavity as thin as a knife, then quickly place it hot in the same cleft, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft. Then treat it with qīrūṭī (a type of ointment) until it heals, God willing.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
On cauterizing a nasal fistula in the mouth.
If a tumor appears at the base of the gums, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then it ulcerates and bursts, and a fistula forms from the running pus. If treatment is unsuccessful, then a cautery iron should be heated to fit the fistula.
Then insert it [the heated cautery] into the hole of the fistula and hold it until the heated iron reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterward with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals, God willing.
If the matter stops and heals, then good. Otherwise, the area must be examined, and the decayed bone removed according to what will be mentioned in its section, God willing.
The twentieth chapter.
For loosening teeth and gums.
If the gums have loosened due to moisture and the teeth have moved, and treatment with medications has been ineffective, then place the patient's head on your lap, and then heat the cautery, whose image will come after this, after placing the tube on the tooth.
Quickly insert the hot cautery, and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth. Then lift your hand, and repeat the cautery several times as desired. Then, the patient should fill their mouth with salt water.
He should hold it for an hour and spit it out.  Then the loose tooth will become firm, and the relaxed gums will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry up.
The twenty-first chapter.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold or worms, and medication is ineffective, cauterization can be performed in two ways: either with oil or with fire.
As for cauterization with butter, take cow's butter, boil it in an iron spoon or a shell, then take a cotton ball, wrap it around the end of a rod, dip it into the boiled butter, and apply it to the aching tooth quickly, holding it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.  If desired, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, then put the heated iron on top to reach the base of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, use a brass or iron tube, somewhat thick-walled to prevent the heat from reaching the mouth of the patient. Then heat the cautery iron and place it on the same tooth, holding it until it cools, repeating this process several times.
The pain will disappear either on that same day or the next. After the cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  This is the image of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you choose, as appropriate.  This is the image of the tube.
The Twenty-Second Chapter.
Concerning the cauterization of swine.
If the swine are affected by phlegm and cold humors, and are not yielding to maturation with medicines, and you want rapid maturation, heat the hollow cautery, which is shown here with both ends perforated.
To cause smoke to emerge from the other end during cauterization, place the protected cautery on the same tumor once, and again if necessary, until you reach the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton swab soaked in clarified butter until what has been burned by the fire is gone. Then treat it with ointment and bandages until it is healed, God willing.
The twenty-third chapter.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If phlegm dominates the trachea, especially if it is accompanied by a cold temperament, then the patient should first be purged with laxative medicines, and then cauterized with a cautery at the nape of the neck, at the base of the throat, in the low-lying area.
Take care not to reach the throat with the cautery, and burn only half of the skin. Then cauterize another time at the neck joint, at the end of the bead, strongly. The cautery should be a pointed one, in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what was previously mentioned until he is cured, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-four.
On cauterizing lung disease and coughing.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture, and there is no fever or consumption in the patient, and the illness is chronic, cauterize twice above the collarbones in the soft, empty, low-lying areas, and once more in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cauterizing instrument should be a pointed one, as previously described. If you prefer, let the cauterization be by dripping with the cautery iron called the "point," whose image was previously given in the section on treating ear pain. The number of points should be around thirty.
Then treat him with what was mentioned before until he is cured.  You may also make a three-pronged cautery of this form, and use it quickly, as you cauterize three areas at once with it.  This is the shape of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus has dislocated due to slippery moisture, or if, when it is returned from dislocation, it does not become firmly fixed, so that it dislocates again at the slightest movement, as we have observed, then the joint must first be restored. Then the patient lies on his back or on his right side, and the skin inside the armpit is pulled upwards with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then the double-bladed cautery, whose image is this, is heated.
Then, cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side. The shape of the cautery is four cauterizations.  It may be cauterized with a three-bladed cautery, in which case the shape of the cauterization will be six cauterizations, and the blades will be the thickness of the affected area.
And this is the image of the three-bladed cautery.
One more may be added to this number, making the cauterizations eight. Then, the pounded balls mixed with salt are applied to the cauterization. The patient must remain still and not move the limb for a while until it is strong.  If the dislocation is upward, this is rare.
Cauterize the shoulder blade with a single, good, nail-like cautery or several small cauterizations.  Then the joint will strengthen, the moisture will be gone, and the patient will recover.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If the stomach is affected by cold and excessive moisture, to the point of deranging its temperament, and frequent discharges occur, and treatment of various kinds has been ineffective, then the patient should lie on his back, extending his legs and arms, and three cauterizations should be applied. Cauterize beneath the breastbone, with a nail-like cautery, to the extent of a finger.  Apply two more cauterizations below, on either side of the first, so that the cauterizations form a triangle. Maintain some distance between them so that they will not coalesce if they become infected.  The depth of the cauterizations should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin. The shape of the cauterizations should be...
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize with one large cauterization in the center of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery used for this single cauterization should be circular in shape, like this.
And the stomach can be cauterized by pricking, for those who fear this cauterization.  That is, mark points on the stomach to the desired extent with ink, then cauterize them with a pointed cautery, and then treat them with the previously mentioned remedies until healed.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If a liver ailment arises due to cold and dampness or a hot wind, to the point that it has deviated excessively from its natural temperament, and the patient has been treated as described in the classification, but this has been unsuccessful. Then the patient should lie on their back, and three cauteries should be marked with ink on the liver, in this shape and precise size, beneath the collarbone, where the human forearm ends.
And after each cautery, there should be a space equal to the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization should be lengthwise and straight along the body. Do not press the iron with your hand forcefully.
Let the depth of the burn on the skin be about half its thickness, and no more.  The patient should stand on their feet; if not able to stand, they should lie down with their legs extended and arms raised. This is the shape of the cautery iron.
You may cauterize these areas with a lancet-shaped cautery iron, if you possess skill and precision in the craft and are careful not to overdo it, lest you burn all the skin, thereby burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, for the skin there is delicate.  Be aware of this.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
Cauterization of a liver tumor.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know if the tumor is in the liver's flesh or its membrane, if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will experience a heaviness and pain, but without severity.
But if it is in the liver's membrane, the pain will be accompanied by intense severity, and if you find that the doctors have exhausted their efforts to treat it, the patient should lie on their back, and then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then, the cautery, which resembles a chisel, is heated in the fire.  This is its image. Cauterize it with a single cautery, so as to burn all the skin and reach the membrane, so that all the pus is expelled, then treat it with the treatment for abscesses until it heals.
This type of cautery should only be performed by someone whose experience in medicine is extensive, and who has repeatedly treated these diseases, for only then should one undertake such a procedure.  To avoid it is preferable.
Chapter Twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients recommended cauterizing a cold fistula with the roots of the zara'und in this manner: Take a single, longest, dried zara'und root, as thick as a finger, dip it in oil, and then hold it in the fire. Then cauterize once between the collarbone and the neck, and two small cauterizations a little below the veins, angled towards the area under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, angled slightly backward; another cauterization in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.  Three cauterizations from behind, one between the shoulders, and two on the sides of the loins, below the cauterization between the ribs.
One should not make the cauterization deep, but rather on the surface of the skin, as a slight burning. Some of the ancients have mentioned that some people used an iron cautery similar to a saw, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
The suppuration will come out, as we mentioned with the liver tumor, and in this case, with cauterization of the abscess, the patient may die immediately, or a fistula may develop at the site, with no cure.
Chapter Thirty.
In cauterization of the spleen.
If, after treating spleen disease using the methods previously described, your treatment proves ineffective, cauterization can be applied in three ways, all of which are valid: one is to cauterize the spleen three or four times in a row along its length.
In the same manner as the cauterization of the liver, described previously, the cauterizations should be spaced a finger's breadth apart or slightly more.  Use the same type of cauterizing tool as for the liver. Do not insert your hand deeply into the cauterization, and the patient should be lying on their back.
The other method involves the elbow.  Raise the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's elbow ends, raising the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends; raise the skin the width of the body so that the cauterizations run the length of the body.
Then, insert the cautery probes, very carefully, until they penetrate the skin on the other side; then, remove the cautery.  The cauterizations will be four. If you wish, you can use the three-probe cautery instead.
Then treat the cauterized area after allowing it to discharge pus for many days; this is more effective than any other treatment previously mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-one.
Concerning the cauterization of dropsy.
Cauterization is effective in dropsy of the abdomen, especially. If you have treated the patient with various treatments as described in the divisions and your treatment has not been effective, you should cauterize the abdomen four times around the navel and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver and another on the spleen.  Two more behind the back, one opposite his chest and one opposite his stomach.  The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin.  Then, leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
Do not neglect the patient's treatment after the cauterization, as is appropriate to gather the necessary benefits so that healing may be expedited.  The shape of the cauterizing iron used for the back is pointed, as described previously. The shape of the cauterizing iron for the abdomen is oval.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If the feet and legs swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the back of the foot at the point between the little finger and the ring finger.
Hold your hand with the cautery iron straight, do not bend it, then lift your hand and do not return it, for this will drain the yellow water.  The cautery iron should be of this shape.
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg.  Use the sharp edge of the cautery iron.  Make one cauterization down the length of each leg, one below the knee and the other lower still, towards the middle of the leg.  Cauterize each thigh, two cauterizations on each.
Leave the cauterizations open without treatment for a long time, so that the water drains out. Then treat them with the other methods we mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-three.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and moisture, weakening the digestive and binding forces in the stomach and intestines, and if other treatments have failed to cure it, and you see the patient strong enough to tolerate a cauterization, then cauterize a large area on his stomach. As previously described, cauterize the stomach with a circular cautery.  Apply four cauterizations around the navel using a gentle pointed cautery.  Apply one or two large cauterizations to the cotton, above the coccyx.
If you see abundant moisture, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize on the pubis and on each flank.  Perhaps add two small cauterizations near the large one on the stomach.  This is a successful and unfailing treatment, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are numerous or single chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, consisting of thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and treatment as described in the section was ineffective, then cauterize the patient with three triangular cauterizations at the base of the spine, slightly under the table.
And a cauterization under the navel about two fingers' breadth.  If you judge that the stomach has become cold, and food is not digesting, and you see his face swollen, cauterize the stomach with a large cauterization as previously mentioned, and cauterize the liver. And another on the spleen with a nail-shaped cautery. Leave the cauterization open for a time, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On the cauterization of warts.
After cutting it, if you have cut the wart, heat the cautery, which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart and press firmly until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood is flowing. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal. If you cauterize a large area on the cotton, it is more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On the cauterization of the fistula that occurs in the perineum and its surrounding areas.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure we described in its place, and avoids it, cauterization might effect a cure.  If a fistula has developed in someone, and pus and corrupt humors are flowing from it, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then determine the depth of its penetration with the probe.  Then heat the cautery iron, which resembles a style, and insert it hot into the same fistula, following the straight line of the fistula's depth and the extent of the probe's penetration. Repeat the cauterization until all the corrupt bodies are burnt, once, twice, or three times as needed.
And be careful not to burn a nerve, if one exists, or a major vein, if the fistula opens into the bladder or the intestines.
And guard against these areas altogether.  You should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge it to be not perforated. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area closes, the substances cease and it remains so for a time, know that it has healed completely.
If the substances do not cease, know that it is perforated, or there is a corrupt bone in its depth or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and consequently, the patient's sexual function is diminished, it is necessary to cauterize on the buttocks, over each kidney, with the nail cautery previously mentioned.  One may even cauterize three times over the same spot, resulting in three sequential cauterizations that will be most beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and dampness, such that the patient cannot control urination, cauterize once below the navel, over the bladder, where the pubic hair begins.  Cauterize again to the right of the navel and another to the left.
After each cauterization, make the cauterization mark the size of a thumb's breadth.  Cauterize the lower back once or twice if necessary.  Use the nail cautery as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If a substance of cold and dampness arises in the uterus, preventing conception, corrupting its substance, and making its flow difficult, or causing pain during menstruation, then three cauterizations should be applied around the navel, as was described in the cauterization of the bladder. One cauterization on the lumbar region below the back, or two if necessary.  Use the nail cautery.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Erroneous moisture may accumulate in the hip joint, causing it to dislocate.  A sign of this is that one leg will be longer than the other when compared, and you will find an empty space where the dislocation is.  Therefore, a nearly circular cauterization should be applied to the affected area of the hip joint itself.
After applying the cauterization around the joint, as it will make the same joint sit at the center of the circle.  Use the cautery that is depicted in the stomach cauterization illustration.  If you do not have this cautery, then use three cauterizations with the large olive cautery.
Make the cauterization deep to the extent of the entire thickness of the skin.  Then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-One.
On cauterizing the sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint, caused by cold and dampness, and you have treated the ailment as described in the section, but the treatment is ineffective and the condition persists, then it is necessary to thin the thick humors with rotten seed, or cactus seed, or similar.
Then cauterize.  The cauterization has two types: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.  Cauterization with fire is in many forms, one of which is to cauterize on the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations, like this.
And this will create a beneficial depth.  The distance between each cauterization should be the width of a finger. The cautery should be olive-colored.  And one may cauterize one cauterization in the middle, on the head of the hip joint itself, making four cauterizations.  Or, if you wish, cauterize with the circular method mentioned previously for hip dislocation, using only one cauterization.
So that the circle surrounds the entire hip, burning the entire thickness of the skin. This is the description of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize with two cauterizations on the thigh, at the location the patient indicates as painful, and one cauterization above the heel, a little towards the outer side, with four fingers' distance. The cautery should be knife-like, and the depth of the cauterization should only be the thickness of the skin.
And if he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize there with a pinpoint cautery three or four times, or more if necessary. If he indicates pain below the knee, towards the leg, cauterize there with a single, knife-like cauterization.
Be careful in all your cauterizations not to reach a nerve or major artery, lest you inflict a serious injury or prolonged affliction on the patient.
I have observed cases of cauterization above the heel where the cauterization was excessive, causing gangrene of the leg, reaching the foot and causing its complete perforation, thus ruining the entire leg.  Subsequently, diarrhea and death ensued. If the pain is in both areas, cauterize them in the same manner.
Some scholars have described a hip cauterization technique using a metal cup-like instrument.  Its diameter is half a span, and its opening is the thickness of a date pit or slightly less.  Inside this cup is another cup, and a third cup within that.
The cups are spaced apart by the width of a thumb's knuckle.  The cups are open on both sides and are about one or two knuckles high.  A handle of iron is securely attached to the cups. This is its form.
Then, it is heated in the fire until it glows red and emits sparks.  Then, it is placed on the hip of the patient, who is lying on their right side.  Three circular cauterizations are applied at once.  The patient is left for three days, and the wound is dressed with oil.  The wound is left open for several days.
Thereafter, it is treated with ointment until healed.  The author of this book stated that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its unpleasantness and frightening appearance.  Few can bear it; however, it is a good cauterization for those who can endure it and for whom it is appropriate.
As for cauterization with burning medications, it involves creating two cups resembling the throat where the hinges of a door are placed, made of copper or iron.
Their height will be about two knuckles, or thereabouts.  The space between them is the thickness of a finger.  The bottom and top are open, and they are joined together in this manner.
Then, they are placed on the hip of the patient, who is lying on their right side.  Hold your hand gently.  Then, pour a little heated, sharp water between the circles. Hold it for about a sandglass's worth of time. The patient must endure the burning and stinging sensation; it feels like fire.
Until the stinging subsides.  Then, remove the instrument and wipe all the sharp water from the hip with fresh water.  Leave it for three days, then apply oil to it until the blackness of the burn disappears. Leave it for several days, allowing the pus to drain, for this is most beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold in the same way as you did for the hip, for what holds the water.  This is the description of sharp water, and its efficacy is proven in my treatise on the improvement of medicines.
Take one part of lye and one part of quicklime.  Grind them together and place them in a new pot with a single small hole at the bottom, large enough for a pestle to enter. Place another glazed pot beneath the bottom of the first pot.
Pour fresh water over the lye and quicklime until it covers them by a finger's breadth, after pressing them well with your hand.  Leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the glazed pot below. Then collect all of that water and pour it over fresh lye and quicklime.
The resulting water will then be very potent, effective in many medical treatments and cauterizing other parts of the body, because it acts like fire itself.  Some remedies for cauterizing the hip include, for instance,  thavsiya, balaذir honey, and lime mixed with soap, all ground into a paste.
Galen, recounting an ancient remedy, claimed it was a cure for hip pain and sciatica.  He greatly esteemed it, claiming that it needed no other treatment and cured in a single application.
So much so that perhaps a man would be carried into the bath and emerge cured.  The method is to take fresh green sițraj, or if not available, fresh dried sițraj, finely grind it with some fat, and apply it to the hip where the pain is, or the leg, or the thigh.
Then bandage it and leave it for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning subside. Afterward, take him into the bath. When his body is moist, place him in a basin. The pain will depart, and he will be healed, God willing. If not, repeat the dressing ten days later.
He will be healed, God willing.  Understand that no one should use these remedies for cauterization unless the body is empty.  Dioscorides mentioned that goat's dung, when used for cauterizing sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization should be performed as follows: Take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep area between the thumb and the forearm, closer to the forearm.  Then take dry goat's dung.
Heat it in the fire until it becomes embers, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes. Repeat this until sensation between the mid-forearm and the hip subsides, and the pain is relieved, God willing. This type of cauterization is called cauterization with dung.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Back pain may arise from various causes, such as a fall, blow, excessive vomiting, and similar things.  It may be due to the accumulation of a cold, damp substance.  Cauterization is applied only in this type of case.
After the patient has vomited, and [is treated with] rotten herbs or similar remedies, he should be cauterized on his back, where the pain is located, with three rows across the table itself.  Each row should have five cauterizations, or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength, having marked the area with ink in each row.
The cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.  If you wish, you can cauterize with three or four cauterizations using a medium-sized nail cautery, in this manner.
Chapter Forty-three.
On cauterizing the beginning of the bump.
This ailment often affects young children.  A sign of its onset in a child is shortness of breath upon standing and moving, and at the end of the spinal vertebrae, a bead-like protrusion is evident, standing out from the other beads.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery, in this manner. To cauterize each side of the vertebra evenly. Or, if you prefer, cauterize around the vertebra with a pinpoint cautery in two or three rows.  Let the points be close together.  Then treat the area until it is healed, as described.
Avoid using cautery on a bump caused by nerve tension.
Chapter Forty-four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pain.
If joint pain is due to cold moisture affecting any part of the body, and if the pain occurs in the legs, physicians typically call it gout, especially.
If the cold gout is treated with the methods we mentioned in the classification and the pain does not disappear, then cautery will remove it.  Cauterize many times around the joint of the legs after vomiting.  The cautery should be olive-oil based and of medium intensity, like this [image or description].
And if it is necessary to cauterize on the surface of the leg, use a small cautery.  If the pain rises to the knees or to other joints – which often happens – cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with the same olive-oil cautery.
If more cauterization is required, cauterize, but do not go deep with the cautery, staying near the thickness of the skin only.  If the pain ascends to the hips or back, use the cauterization methods mentioned in the relevant section.
If the pain is only in the hands, cauterize around the wrists in a circular pattern, like two rows. If the pain remains in the fingers, cauterize a point on each knuckle and on the palm of the hand. If the pain rises to the elbows or shoulders after several days,
Cauterize both sides.  The patient must also adhere to good treatment and take medicine.  If the patient eats well and expels phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the cauterization of hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some of the intestines and bowels descend into the testicle, and this has happened recently, the patient should be told to abstain from eating that day and to use laxatives to evacuate his bowels.
Then, he should lie on his back before you, and you should tell him to restrain himself until the bowel or intestines come out.  Then, you push them back in with your finger.  Then, mark with ink under the hernia, on the pubic bone, a mark resembling a semicircle, with its ends pointing towards the upper part of the body.
Then, heat a cautery iron, this is its form.
Until it becomes white, emitting sparks.  Then, push the intestines or bowels back into his abdomen.  Then, a servant should place his hand over the area so that the intestines do not come out again.  A space has been created between the patient's legs, and a pillow has been placed underneath. Another servant holds his legs together.
And another on his chest holds his hands. Then, place the cautery iron on the same mark, with your hand holding the cautery iron upright until it reaches the bone, or repeat the process if it did not reach the bone the first time.
Take care to prevent the intestines from protruding while cauterizing, so that you do not burn them, causing either death or a great injury to the patient.  Know that if you do not reach the bone with the cauterization, your work will not succeed.  The cautery iron should be appropriate in size for children and for adults.
Then, treat the cauterized area with oil after three days to remove the harshness of the burn, then treat it with other ointments until it heals.  Let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is closed.
His diet during his treatment should soften his bowels to prevent the intestines from protruding during defecation.  Then, if he wishes to stand up after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.  Reduce his exertion, food intake, drink, and loud noises.
If he follows this treatment, he will be completely cured, God willing.  I will describe the treatment of hernias by incision in its appropriate section, God willing.  As for a hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is still starting, if you want to prevent it from getting worse, cauterize it with a circular cautery appropriate to its size. Let the amount of skin you burn be about one-third. Then treat it as we have described, for it will not worsen, God willing. Some earlier physicians have described cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery iron in this way.
After marking the hernia with ink, making a line across the top of the hernia and another line below it, place your hand in the middle with a single, nail-like cautery.  The first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If a part of the body suffers a fall or blow, and the resulting pain persists for a long time and is not relieved by medication, it is necessary to cauterize the affected area with a pinpoint cautery.  The cauterization of each body part should be proportionate to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
The pain and fistula will be controlled by it. If he is cured by the first cauterization, then well and good. Otherwise, the cauterization should be repeated, because it is the nature of these pains to spread from one part of the body to the nearby ones; therefore, it is necessary to follow up with cauterization until the patient is cured.
Chapter Forty-seven.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
As for those afflicted with leprosy, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially those cases of leprosy that arise from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize him, examine him. If the leprosy is in its early stages, and you have treated it as described in the section on classification, and it has not worsened or stopped, and you fear that the corruption will spread to all the humors of the patient, cauterize him five times on the head. The first cauterization should be in the usual center of the head; the second, beneath it, towards the forehead, near the end of the hair; two more on the temples; and one at the back of the neck, at the base of the skull.  Apply the cauterization somewhat forcefully so that a slight effect is produced on the bone.
Scales will then be detached, making it easier for the thick vapors to escape.  A cauterization should also be applied to the spleen as previously described.  However, if the leprosy has persisted and become evident in the patient, it is necessary to cauterize him with the cauterizations mentioned on the head. One cauterization on the tip of the nose; two on each cheek; two on the cervical vertebrae; six on the thoracic vertebrae; one large one on the coccyx, at the base of the spine, and another above it on the same area; and two on each thigh, one on each hip. Two on each knee; two on each shoulder; two on each elbow; two on the ribs of the chest; and a cauterization on every joint of the fingers and toes; and on every heel and on the wrists.
Avoid burning the nerves at the backs of the heels.  A cauterization may also be applied to the pubic bone, the stomach opening, and the liver.  Know that the more cauterizations, the more beneficial and effective they will be.
Know that the patient does not experience pain from the cauterizations as much as a healthy person, because his body is numb.  The cauteries should be of various sizes, according to the organs and joints, as described in the properties of the irons.
Then treat the cauterization with fine crushed carob, along with honey and other treatments, until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Forty-eight.
Concerning cauterizing numbed areas: If a part of the body is numb and treated with medicines, ointments, and bandages, but does not heal, cauterize the same numb area with cauterizations appropriate to the size of the affected part of the body, taking care to keep the cauterizations slightly below the surface of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  Cauterization may also be used for some numbness that affects the hand or foot, in the spinal vertebrae near the exit point of the nerve that controls that limb, to eliminate the numbness.
Only those knowledgeable about the anatomy of the body and the exits of the nerves that move the body should undertake this.
Chapter Forty-nine.
On cauterizing leprosy.
If leprosy persists despite all medical treatments, cauterize it with a slight depth, proportionate to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and the color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose ointment,  horsetail leaves, dove blood, or hawk's blood, one part of each. Mix them all together, apply to a cloth, and bind to the affected area until healed.
Chapter Fifty.
On cauterizing cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it turns. Some physicians have suggested a forceful cauterization in the center, but I do not think this is advisable, as I anticipate ulceration, and have observed such cases repeatedly.
Therefore, the correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with multiple small cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If a fistula has occurred and is slow to mature, either due to the inherent nature of the condition, the age of the patient (if elderly and anemic), or the passage of time, and you wish to accelerate the fistula's maturation, cauterize around it with numerous small, pinpoint cauterizations.
Then leave it, for this will hasten its maturation. If you wish to further cauterize it, heat the cautery iron to this [specific] temperature.
Place it in the center of the fistula until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be from below, to facilitate the flow of pus. Then treat it as necessary until healed.
Chapter fifty-two.
On cauterizing ulcers.
Ulcers are a corruption that spreads through a limb, consuming it like fire consumes dry wood.  If you see an ulcer in a place suitable for cauterization with fire, heat a cautery iron, using many small and large nails, according to what is appropriate for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from all sides until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing remains.  Then leave it for three days, and apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scab and corruption are removed.
Then treat it with healing ointments. If after three days you see that the flesh grows healthy without corruption, then leave it alone. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on any remaining affected areas.  The ulcer may also be treated with a strong medicine.
For it serves the same purpose as fire, more quickly effective.  I have mentioned the treatment of ulcers with strong medicine in the classifications; take it from there when needed.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This affliction, a rough, painful condition, frequently occurs on the soles of the feet.  Cauterization can be performed in two ways: either with fire or with a strong caustic liquid.
As for cauterization with fire, heat a hollowed-out cautery iron, resembling an eagle's wing, crafted from metal, to completely encircle the nail.  The edges should be thin.  Then lower it, hot, onto the nail, and rotate your hand with the cautery iron around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail.
Leave it for three days to begin to suppurate. Then dress it with crushed wild barley mixed with salt, leaving the dressing on overnight.  This will remove it from its roots. Then treat the wound with a healing ointment until healed; if the nails are not inverted.
It often occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet.  Therefore, one should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's wing, and place it on the nail or wart.  Then pour a small amount of strong liquid into the tube.
Hold the tube with your hand, gently rotating it, so that the edges of the tube affect the root of the nail, and the strong liquid finds its way to the root of the nail.  The patient should endure the stinging of the strong liquid for a short time.
Then leave it; the nail will come out by its roots.  Do this one by one until all those in the body are dealt with.  Then treat the affected areas after they are removed with ointments that promote healing.
Chapter Forty-five.
In the treatment of the scabies.
If scabies occurs due to cold in the nerves or from a fever of a quarter or other cause, it is necessary to cauterize four or five times on the back, between each cauterization, cauterizing on the chest as well. And cauterize his stomach with an olive oil cautery; the scabies will subside and hasten the maturation of the cold illness.
Chapter Fifty-five.
In the cauterization of a developing boil on the body.
Sometimes ugly boils may arise in the body from thick, corrupt cold materials.  At their first appearance, a gentle cauterization should be applied to the head of each boil using a burning stick, a long asparagus stem, or a lens-shaped cautery.
Boils may be cauterized in this manner at their first appearance, so that the active cause of them does not increase and the patient is cured; however, this should be done only after the patient has been bled.
Chapter Fifty-six.
In cauterizing bleeding occurring when an artery is cut.
Bleeding frequently occurs from an artery that has been cut in a wound that is exposed from the outside, or when a tumor or a body part is incised or cauterized, and similar cases; and it is difficult to stop the bleeding.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger over the mouth of the artery and press it gently until the blood is contained beneath your finger and nothing escapes. Then, place several small and large olive-wood cauteries in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then, take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery has been opened, and place the cautery on the same vein after quickly removing your finger and holding the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If the bleeding spurts out when you remove your finger from the mouth of the artery and the cautery cools down, quickly take another cautery from the ones in the prepared fire and continue doing this one after another until the bleeding stops.
And be cautious not to burn a nerve, for this would cause another affliction for the patient.  Know that if an artery is bleeding, it cannot be cut, especially if it is large, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by amputation if it has not already been severed. If it is severed, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop; or it can be tied with strong threads; or medications that can stop the bleeding and constrict the vessels can be applied.
As for those who attempt to cut it with a bandage, or by constricting it with rags, or by applying burning things, and the like, it will not be cut in that way at all, except rarely. If someone encounters such a situation and is not attended by a physician or medicine, then they should immediately place their index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we described.
He should press it firmly until the blood is contained and flows from above the wound, over the artery and the finger.  The finger should not be removed until the blood solidifies and thickens, and the bleeding stops. During this time, one should observe what cauterization or medication is needed.
The Second Chapter.
On incisions, lancing, phlebotomy, and surgical procedures in general.
In the previous chapter, we discussed all diseases that are suitable for cauterization with fire and burning medications, their causes and reasons, and the tools and methods of cauterization, presenting this material as chapters from the heel to the foot.
And I will follow the same path in this chapter to make the desired material easier for the student to understand.
Before I begin, you must know, my children, that this chapter contains even more uncertainty than the first chapter on cauterization.
Therefore, the caution must be greater, for in this chapter, the act often leads to the emptying of blood, which is essential for life, when opening a vein, making an incision on a tumor, lancing an abscess, treating a wound, extracting an arrow, or cutting into a stone, or similar procedures. All of these are accompanied by risk and fear, and death often results.
I advise you to avoid any questionable actions, for in this craft, you may encounter people suffering from various illnesses.  Some may be weary of their disease and consider death as a relief.
Because of the severity of their illness and the length of their suffering, there are symptoms that point to death.  Some may offer you their wealth, hoping for health, but their illness is deadly; therefore, you should not be aided by those of this character in any way.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness. Do not undertake anything without certain knowledge of the favorable outcome.  Use knowledge and warnings about the potential outcome of healing in all treatment of your patients.
For in this, you will gain praise, glory, remembrance, and thanks. May God guide you, my children, with wisdom, and not deprive you of correctness and success.  There is no god but Him.
I have arranged this chapter into sections, following the previous chapter on cauterization, from the head to the foot, so that you will find what you need, God willing.
Chapter One.
Concerning the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
This ailment often affects infants at birth if the midwife applies pressure to the baby's head without gentleness. It may also arise from a hidden cause that is unknown.
I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than infants, and all those I saw who were affected died quickly.  Therefore, I deem it best to abandon treatment.  I have seen an infant whose head had filled with water, and the head enlarged each day. Until the infant could not sit up by himself due to the great size of his head, and the moisture increased until he perished.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone, or beneath the bone on the periosteum. If the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, a single incision should be made across the center of the head, approximately two spans long, so that the moisture drains.  This is the method of incision.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling larger, make two intersecting incisions in this manner:
If the moisture is under the bone, and the sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and the water sinks when you press it with your hand inwards, this is not hidden from you. Then, you should make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
After the incision, all the moisture will drain out. Then, the incisions should be tightened with strips and bandages.  Afterwards, the head should be wrapped with dressings, and oil applied until the fifth day. Then, the bandages should be removed, and the wound treated with ointments and compresses.  Maintain a moderate bandage on the head and feed the patient only dry, low-moisture foods.
Until the limb strengthens and heals. Another method of incision is to look where the bone of the swelling and accumulation of water appears, for it may be located more in the back of the head, or in the front, or to the right, or to the left.
You should aim your incision where the swelling and water accumulation have appeared.  Incise as best you can, being careful not to cut an artery, lest a hemorrhage occur and the patient dies from the bleeding, having expelled the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Severing the two arteries behind the ears, known as the "hissers".
If someone experiences a severe affliction in the eyes or chest, and this lasts a long time without being cured by medicines, the best treatment in this case is to cut these two arteries.
If you wish to cut them, you should first shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the artery.  Then, tie the patient's neck with their garment.  Look for where the vein pulsates, in the two recessed areas behind the ears.  They are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, and cut them with a dissecting knife, severing them to the bone.  This should be done at the side of the head. If you wish, insert the knife under the artery and cut upwards. The cut should be about two clenched fingers long.
If the vein is cut, blood will flow out rhythmically, surging forward and continuously. If the artery is not visible, you should measure from the ear approximately three fingers' breadth, mark it with ink, and cut to the bone.  And what is necessary...
About six ounces of blood will likely flow at once, though perhaps more or less, depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries.  Then, examine the wound. If any of the peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it off.
So that a hot swelling does not develop, then bandage the wound with a linen thread, and treat with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
The arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from a chronic headache or acute attacks of severe heat and humidity affecting the muscles of the temples, or a severe chronic headache, and similar afflictions, and treatment by various medical methods is ineffective, then we have tried in these cases to cauterize or dissect the arteries of the temples as described.
The procedure for dissecting them is that the patient's hair in the temples should be shaved, and the visible artery in the temple should be located, as its pulse will be apparent.  It is rarely hidden, except in exceptional cases.
Or, if the artery is hidden due to extreme cold, the patient should tighten his neck with his clothing, then you should rub the area with a cloth or apply warm water until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the lancet, which is of this form. Then carefully dissect the skin with the lancet until you reach the artery.  Then insert a hook and pull it upward, until you remove it from the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on all sides. If the artery is thin, twist it with the end of the hook. Then cut off a section of it, large enough for its ends to separate and contract, without causing bleeding.  If it is not severed and disconnected, the blood will not actually recede.  Then drain the blood, from six to three ounces.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong doubled thread, whether of silk or bowstrings, so that putrefaction does not rapidly occur before the wound heals, causing bleeding.
Then cut off the excess between the ligatures.  Do this at that time, or at a later time. If you wish, cauterize it to the bone with a scalpel-like cautery, so that its edges are severed. This will achieve the same result, or even a better one, as we have said.
However, if the patient has a fever or a heated temperament, cauterization is helpful in consuming moisture, and therefore even more beneficial.  After dissecting the arteries, the area should be packed with old cotton and covered with firm bandages.  After healing, treat it with dry medications that promote flesh regeneration and with lint until it heals, God willing.
If during your procedure bleeding occurs from the artery, promptly cut it, either by cautery or by filling the area with alum and tightening your hand until the bleeding stops.  If you lack any of these things, place your finger until the blood coagulates.
Apply very cold water to the area until the pain subsides and the tissue tightens as it should.  A less invasive and easier method than dissecting the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the two spots with ink.
Heat it very intensely until it reaches the bone, and cauterize the vein in two places so that the distance between its ends is widened.  It will not adhere with this cautery.  This is an image of the cautery.
Its blades should be sharp, similar to small daggers, but significantly less sharp than a knife. If they were as sharp as a knife, the cold would reach them quickly, and the flesh would not separate rapidly. If they have a bit of thickness, the heat of the fire will hold in them.
This quickly cuts the flesh, and is the best, easiest, and simplest method. The distance between the blades should be the thickness of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
In treating the constant, hot, running of tears from the eyes.
If the tears are constant and flowing from the veins on the skull's exterior, and no medicinal treatment helps, and you see the patient's face has reddened. He feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like ants crawling, and his eyes are sunken, moist, their lashes eroded and their eyelids glued shut due to the intensity of the tears.  Earlier practitioners of medicine resorted to this procedure for treatment, calling it "treatment with the sword."  It involves instructing the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made on the forehead, along its length. Each incision is about two fingers long, aligned with the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second one slightly offset from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from the contact between the jaws.  After each incision, maintain a distance of three fingers clasped together.  Have with you prepared sponge or many dry cloths to absorb the blood.
Then insert the sharp-pointed lancet, which has this shape. From the incision next to the temple, to the middle incision, you scrape away all the skin between the incisions, along with the periosteum on the bone.  Then, do the same from the middle incision to the third incision.  Then remove the lancet. And insert into the first incision another instrument, called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth and blunt on the other. This is its shape.
Turn the sharp side of the scalpel towards the flesh adhering to the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle incision, cutting all vessels descending from the head to the eyes, without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do this from the middle incision to the other incision.  After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, press the areas of clotted blood.  Then place a cotton wick in each incision, and apply a bandage soaked in a mixture of liquid, oil, or vinegar and oil.
To prevent inflammation.  On the third day, dissolve the ligaments and apply plenty of lukewarm water.  Then treat with basil ointment mixed with rose oil and other remedies for wounds until healed, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from the interior of the head.
When someone suffers from frequent, severe, persistent discharges, and their eyes appear sunken and small, their vision weakened, and their eyelids ulcerated with eyelashes falling out. And there will be severe, painful pain deep within the head, and continuous sneezing.  Recognize from these symptoms that these materials and discharges come from many deep veins.  The best treatment for this is to order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there will be severe, painful pain deep within the head, and continuous sneezing.  Recognize from these symptoms that these materials and discharges come from many deep veins.  The best treatment for this is to order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead. Or raise it slightly horizontally, beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and the incision should be to the bone. Keep your hand away from the moving temporal muscles when chewing. Once the bone is exposed and all the blood is wiped away with a sponge...
Then separate the edges of the incision with worn cotton or linen thread.  Afterwards, apply compresses and soak them with medicine and oil to prevent a hot swelling.  Once the inflammation has subsided, and you see that the hot swelling has resolved, you should rub the bone until the growth of flesh begins there.
Then treat it with a dried preparation that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts galbanum, preparing a salve from them, and using it to promote flesh growth in wounds of this type.
Chapter Six.
Concerning the treatment of things that fall into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or a substance similar to a stone, such as iron or glass; or a plant seed, such as chickpeas, seeds, and the like; or a liquid, such as water and vinegar, and the like.
Or, if it is an animal, if a pebble or something similar that doesn't grow in the ear has fallen in, expose the ear to the sun.  If you see the pebble, apply a little violet or cerucean oil to it, and then try to remove it by moving the head or by inducing sneezing with a blunt instrument. And close the nostrils when a sneeze comes, after placing a bandage of cloth or wool around the ear and tilting the ear upwards.  This treatment often removes it. If it does not come out, try to remove it with a gentle forceps, the kind of which this is a depiction.
If it does not come out with the forceps, then try to remove it with a gentle, slightly bent, blunt probe.  If it does not come out with that either, make a copper tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear opening, gently.
Seal the area around the tube with softened pitch mixed with oil, so that the air has no path other than the tube.  Then pull it out with a strong pull.  It often comes out this way. If it does not come out by the methods described, then take a small piece of the gum of the Nabataeans or of the gum used to catch birds, and place it on the end of the instrument.
After wrapping it tightly with lint, then gently insert it into the ear opening after the ear is dry.  If it does not come out by all the methods described, then proceed to incision before a hot swelling or contraction occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient at the temples, drawing out blood according to their strength.  Then, have the patient sit before you, tilting their ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear, near the cartilage, in the lowest part.
The incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone.  Then remove it with whatever instruments you can.  Then stitch the incision immediately and treat it until it heals.
And if the object fallen into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, attempt to remove it using the methods mentioned. If it does not come out, then take a thin, delicate forceps of this form.
Try to cut that type of fallen seed in the ear with it, but only do this if you are sure the seed has become dampened by the ear's vapor so that it is broken into many small pieces.  Then remove it with a blind probe, a fine wick, or by suction.
As mentioned, it is easier to remove it.  As for water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use a nasal insufflator (kunds) to sneeze.  They should have filled their ear with some old cotton, while lying on the ear with the water, and if it comes out in this way...
Otherwise, take many small, smooth pebbles, warm them slightly by fire, and have the patient insert one into the ear canal.  The patient should lean on one leg on that side, and strike another stone against the stone in the ear.
He should continue doing this with pebble after pebble until all the water is expelled.  Water might also be expelled by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and burning the other end until it is mostly burned, then repeating with another feather.
Repeat this until all the water is expelled, or draw it out with a tube, as previously described with the pebble.  As for removing an animal that has entered the ear, if it is small, like a flea or similar, treat it as described in the classification.  As for...
If the creature is large and visible, try to remove it with linen cloths and tweezers.  Removing it is easier than anything else that might be in the ear.  As for removing worms that have developed in the ear, if treatment with what we have mentioned in the classification in the section on insects has not been successful.
Then you should look into the ear in the sun.  If you see anything of the worm, remove it with linen or fine tweezers. If nothing appears, take a tube, of this shape.
Narrow at the bottom, wide at the top.  Insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it, repeating until all the worms are expelled. If it does not come out, seal around the tube with wax, as I described to you in the case of the pebble.
If it does not come out using the above methods, use the insects described.  Earlier practitioners have used them to kill the worms, as you will find in the section on insects.  Applying ointments and medications to the ear can be done with this instrument, of this shape.
As you see, make it of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top.  If you wish, the barrel inside the tube can be made of solid copper.  If you wish, you can take a spindle and wrap tightly with cotton at its end.
Then place the ointment, or juice, or any medication you desire, into the tube, while it is in the ear. Then, insert the spindle wrapped with cotton from above, and gently squeeze with your hand until the ointment flows into the ear cavity and is felt.
Have the patient inside, and whatever you place in the ear, warm it slightly in the fire. Beware that the thing you are dripping into it is not excessively cold or hot, as the ear cannot tolerate it.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of ear blockage.
Some children may emerge from their mothers' wombs with their ear canals not pierced.
Some people may also experience blockage in the ear canal due to a wound or growing flesh within it.  This blockage can occur deep within the ear canal, beyond the sight's reach.
It may also be present slightly outside the canal and visible.  Blockages deep within the ear, invisible to the eye, are more difficult to treat.  If the blockage is visible, then one should place the patient's ear in the sun. And look at it. If you see the blockage outwardly, then open it with a gentle scalpel.  This is its appearance:
Its tip should have a small, limited protrusion, and the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear. If the blockage is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it gently until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, take a smooth, gentle probe, warm it slightly in fire, and then insert it into the ear canal.  If you feel the blockage and the patient experiences heaviness of hearing, remove it gently.
Be careful not to injure the ear membrane. Then, place a wick into the ear, sized to fit the hole, and apply Egyptian ointment. Repeat this for several days until the wound is safe from adhesions.  Alternatively, soak a wick in water and sprinkle powdered za'aj on it.
Use this.  If you see the ear has become swollen with a hot swelling, then remove the wick and replace it with another wick soaked in a concoction made with rose oil, so as to alleviate the hot swelling. Then continue treatment until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear.  Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the chapter on hemorrhages.
Chapter Eight.
On treating warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  They should be grasped with a forceps or a needle and cut off at their roots with a scalpel, then a powdered zage is applied to the area.
If bleeding occurs, cauterize it with a gentle lentil-shaped cautery iron.  Cauterization is better after the excision.  It often returns if any part of the root remains.  If cauterized with fire, the roots are burned and it does not return.
Chapter Nine.
On treating colds affecting the eyelids.
A condition resembling a cold in its severity and firmness often appears on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called a cold, which is the accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.  If the cold is protruding on the surface of the eyelid, moving in every direction, the treatment is simple: make a transverse incision.
Then carefully peel it away from every side until it detaches, and then hang it up by a hook and cut it. If cutting it is not possible except after penetrating the eyelid with the cut, that will do no harm to the patient. If the cut is large, bring the edges together with sutures and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, there is no need to worry about it, as ointment will fix and mend it. If the cold is leaning inwards towards the inner surface of the eyelid, turn the eyelid inside out, and hang the cold up with a hook without needing an incision, and trim it from all sides.
If the eyelid is penetrated by the cut, that will not harm anything. Then wash the eye with salt water after cutting the cold, and treat the area with what will cause healing until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of the sty that appears on the eyelid.
A sty is a swelling that occurs in the layers of the upper eyelid. It is most common in children, and it weighs down their eyes and causes them colds in the night hours, and they are unable to look at sunlight. Because tears come quickly to them.
Therefore, you see them leaning on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids beneath their eyebrows are damp, possibly swollen, and the sty is clearly visible.  If you press the area with your fingers, you feel the sty between them.  The treatment is to have the patient rest their head on your lap.
Then take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick to fit around the sty on all sides.  Then place it on the sty and press with your fingers on all sides to collect the sty in the center of the circle.
Then, with a lancet, make a horizontal incision through the middle of that moisture, an incision no larger than the incision made in bloodletting.  As for depth, it is necessary to cut through the entire skin until you reach the sty.
In most cases, the sty emerges from the incision as a white piece of fat.  Pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, moving your hand back and forth until it heals.  Be careful not to enlarge the incision, lest the lancet injure the eye.
If the sty does not appear immediately after the initial incision, gently increase the incision a little until the sty protrudes.  Then, pull it out as we described.  Then, dip a cloth in vinegar and water and apply it to the area, securing it with a bandage. Some people crush salt.
Place it in the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture, then treat it until it heals.  If a hot swelling occurs at the site, treat it with cooling compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On types of eye dressings.
If superfluous eyelashes grow on the eyelid, outside the natural course, beneath the natural eyelashes, and are chronic, they harm the eye and cause various illnesses such as persistent tearing, eyelid relaxation, white discoloration, and thickening, ultimately causing the eye to become useless.
Eye dressings are of four types: either by cauterization with fire, or by a sharp medicine, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization; or the dressing may be by cutting and stitching, or by applying reeds, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns, then insert a needle with thread underneath the eyelid and pierce the needle and thread through the upper eyelid, near the hair itself. Pull the thread upwards on the eyelid.
Turn it with a spatula, then cut the inside of the eyelid, away from the extra hair, using a blunt scalpel from the larger to smaller incision, then pull the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth underneath the eyelid, then stitch the eyelid with thread.
It should resemble the shape of an asa leaf, but the shape should be according to the amount of eyelid elevation required, as this may vary between people. Some may require a specific amount of eyelid tissue to be cut, depending on the extent of eyelid relaxation.
Some may require a smaller cut, all according to the degree of eyelid relaxation.  Then, using the scalpel, cut along the lines that you marked, starting from the larger incision to the smaller incision.  Each cut should be near the natural hair, approximately the thickness of a spatula.
Then, insert the forceps into one of the skin's corners and scrape off the whole skin, then stitch the two edges together using a fine wool needle and thread, and wipe away the blood.  Adhere any remaining thread to the eyebrows with adhesive substances.
You may or may not perform this procedure; it is up to you. Then, the sutures and threads remain for about three or four days, and then treat it.  If you prefer, leave the wound unstitched and treat it with something that dries and contracts it, as the eyelid will elevate when the wound is closed.  Suturing is preferable.
This method of the operation of the upper eyelid, previously described, entails some effort for the patient, but is a good method with no danger.  Another approach to the operation of the upper eyelid is to shape the eyelid like an asa leaf, as we have described. Then raise the eyelid with three forceps, either separate or grouped in this way.
Then, cut off the excess eyelid with small scissors, in this manner, with careful precision.
If you are unable to hold the forceps and the shaping is not satisfactory, take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger opening and a third near the smaller opening.  Hold the threads evenly with your fingers and then lift your hand in a steady manner.
Lift all of the marked skin as described, then stitch the edges of the wound and treat it until healed.  If a hot swelling appears at the time of cutting or incision, relieve that swelling with *qīrūṭī* or similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also experience a reversal of its folds.  In this case, the procedures mentioned previously—cutting, stitching, cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a sharp medicine—should be employed.  Cauterization with fire or with a sharp medicine is more gentle on the patient than cutting and stitching.  Cutting and stitching are more laborious in these cases.
Cauterization with reeds is performed in this manner: Turn the eyelid over and make the incision from the inside, as previously described. Then prepare two thin reeds or sticks, their length equal to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
Nibble the ends of each reed on both sides where the threads adhere, then gently bring them together over the remaining portion of the eyelid.  Tighten the reeds firmly from both sides and leave them for several days. The tightened skin will die, turn black, and decay.
Until it falls away on its own. If it takes longer, nibble it with the forceps and then treat it until healed. When it adheres, the eyelid will rise, and the folds will not irritate the eye.  This is the shape and size of the reeds, to be made exactly to this length and width:
Chapter Twelve.
Removing irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
If there is one or two hairs, take a thin needle, thread it with a smooth, thin silk thread, tie the ends with a very gentle knot, and make the thread about a span long.
Then attach another, shorter, thin thread to the tweezers. Tie the ends if desired. The patient should place their head on your lap, close to the light for better visibility, as the work is delicate. Then, using the tweezers and the needle, gently insert the needle into the base of the extra hair.
Penetrate the eyelid with the needle, carefully removing the hair from above the natural hair, then pull the thread upward through the tweezers, and remove the hair(s) – one, two, or three at most – from the tweezers.
Then, pull gently, until the hair comes out of the eyelid with the tweezers and along with the natural hair. If the tweezers come out but the hair does not, pull the tweezers downwards with the thread you attached, pulling them out from the upper opening.
Then, reposition the hair in the tweezers and pull them out, repeating this until the hair is visible through the upper opening. At that point, remove the tweezers and thread, close the eye, and keep it closed for two or three days, until the hair is securely in place and the flesh grows around it.
If the hair is short, either attach a longer strand of natural hair to it so it can be pulled out, or leave it until it grows longer, then remove it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On treating the stye that occurs on the upper eyelid.
The stye that affects this area is called a "rabbit's eye" stye.  It can be either natural or accidental.  Accidental styes result from the infection of a wound, cut, burn, or similar injury.
The treatment involves incising the abscess, separating its edges, and inserting a linen thread between them, tying it off until healed.  Do not use substances that dry and constrict in treating it.
If you do this, the stye will return even worse.  Instead, use softening substances such as fenugreek, and a decoction of licorice root in water, linseed, and diachylon ointment, dissolved with some oils, and apply this mixture to the thread and use it for treatment.
The key to its treatment is to prevent it from adhering in the same way as before.  The method described above is only a part of treating the stye; it does not restore the area's original appearance.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of styes that occur in the lower eyelid.
This stye, which arises from the lower part, is truly the stye; it is natural.  An accidental stye results from a wound, laceration, or burn, and the like.
The method is to take a needle with a doubled thread, pierce the flesh, passing it from the inner to the outer corner until the thread is at the ends of the flesh.  Then, pull the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, then do this. Otherwise, take a spatula and place it on the wound. Turn the eyelid, and cut two incisions in the inside of the eyelid.  The edges of the incisions should extend from the corners of the cut, meeting to form an angle. So that when they meet, the shape will resemble this shape:.
Then, remove the flesh as much as the sharp side of it is below the eyelid.  Afterward, bring the separated parts together with two stitches, sewing them with wool thread. Then treat it as mentioned previously with relaxing and softening remedies until healed.
If the ulceration arose from a cut, suture, or cauterization, then a small incision should be made, also as before, without touching the eyelashes.  Then separate the lips with a softener, as described previously.
In summary, for treating ulcers, whether above or below, perform the procedure according to the appearance of the ulcer.  It can vary greatly in form, and the skilled surgeon devises a method that is possible.
Until the form returns to or nearly resembles its natural state.  The nature of the disease itself indicates the appropriate treatment and tools, in most cases.
Fifteenth Chapter.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may affect many people, causing the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, hindering its free movement and natural functions.  Therefore, a blunt instrument should be inserted under the eyelid.
And lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not as sharp as surgical scalpels, but rather somewhat blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the procedure and the scalpel slips and injures the eye with its sharpness.  Your incision should be like gently peeling away the adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its normal position and the entire adhesion heals.  Then, instill salty water into the eye to wash it, or instill a solution of zinjārī (likely a specific herbal preparation) in water, and then separate the eyelid and eye with a linen thread.
Place moistened white of egg on the eye.  After three days, use medicated poultices until healed.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the excision of the toenail and deep flesh growths.
The toenail is of two types: either nervous, resembling a firm, thin membrane, or non-nervous, resembling a stiff, white moisture; if touched by iron or attempted to be grasped with a hook, it breaks.
A hook does not adhere to either type.  Both types begin from the larger root, gradually progressing until they cover the eye and obstruct light and eye movement.  The procedure for their excision is for the patient to place their head on a cushion.
Then, he opens his eyes and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the toenail with a slightly curved hook and pull it upwards.  Then, take a needle, thread it with a horsehair or cowhair and strong thread, bend the needle tip slightly, and insert it into the center of the toenail.
Pierce it with the needle, tie the toenail with the thread, pull it upwards, and peel away the side of the toenail that lies next to the pupil with the hair as if spreading it until its end. Then, cut the remaining portion at the root with a gentle scalpel or small scissors, leaving the natural flesh of the root.
So that a constant flow of tears does not result from its excision. The toenail may be pulled out with the hook alone, or with the thread as we stated, then the smooth scalpel peels the portion which has this image.
Care must be taken to avoid touching the cornea with the scalpel, lest it creates a tear in the pupil.  Then, after the excision, place some powdered salt or zinc oxide into the eye, and leave it until the next day, then treat it as necessary until healed.
If the toenail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle into it or secure it with a hook, this type of toenail is often treated with medication, healing as described in the classification.  If you want to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, blunt scalpel, like this image. Carefully scrape the toenail from above, gently. If you see that it is crumbling and only the scraping has affected it, put a few drops of zinc oxide, red oxide, or powdered salt into the eye from your medicine dropper, and compress the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot tumor appears in the eye. Leave it, and treat the hot tumor until it heals, then resume the scraping until it heals. And concerning the protruding flesh [of the affected area].
If the protrusion is causing significant discomfort to the eye, suspend it with a hook, and cut off a portion of it. Do not over-cut to avoid excessive tearing. Then, apply red or zinc oxide drops into the affected area until healed.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting the warty growths and excess flesh in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red, layered flesh may grow until it covers the pupil, or nearly covers it, or spills onto the eyelids.  The eyelids might even turn outward, resembling a rose.
The treatment is to have the patient rest their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and carefully remove all of the red flesh with appropriate hooks.
Or hold it with a probe or forceps, then cut the flesh piece by piece until all is removed, and protect the eye so that it is not injured during the procedure. Your cutting can be done using either the scalpel we described for cutting the toenail, or with small scissors. Like the way one gathers thorns, as their image will appear in the following chapter.
Once the removal is complete and all the fleshy growths are gone, fill the eye with finely ground salt, or drop into it red or similar corrosive medicines.  Apply a bandage made from egg white to the outside of the eye to prevent inflammation.
If any fleshy growths remain, and bleeding occurs, and you fear inflammation, leave the eye and treat it to relieve swelling. Then return to the procedure until healed.  Do the same with any excess flesh of this type that appears in the eye.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye by natural means or by surgical intervention with iron. Do not insert your hand into any of these procedures until you see that the organ can tolerate the procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
Concerning the extraction of objects from the eye.
Red threads intertwining on the eye hinder vision and weaken the eye over time.  Therefore, first, look to see if the eye containing the threads is strong and has no other ailment besides the threads.
Then, the extraction is done by having the patient place their head on your lap, and gently lifting the threads with one or two fine hooks, shaped thus:
Or, two hooks joined together as in this form:
Then, gently extract the threads with a fine pair of scissors.  Wipe away the blood periodically until you see the eye is free of the threads and the bleeding has stopped.  Protect the eye; do not injure it with the scissor tips.  Work during the middle of the day, in the shade.
Be very meticulous in your work so as not to cut anything but the threads.  When finished, drop green or red ophthalmic solution into the eye to consume any remaining threads.  If you cannot remove all the threads at this time, bandage the eye to soothe any pain.
Leave it for several days until the pain and inflammation subside, then repeat the procedure in the same way until it heals.  This is the manner in which the scissors should be used.
Leave it [and let the patient's head rest on the student's lap; another student should wipe away tears and examine the front and back of the eye, and you]—the correct procedure is to open the eye using adjustable or triangular devices held by a student.
Closely observe, with the patient's head resting on the student's lap, and another student wiping away tears while examining the front and back of the eye. You have the choice of starting the extraction from the upper or lower part of the eye.  Preferably, extract two threads from the upper eyelid, one near the end and one near the beginning of the arch.
Grasp the threads between the middle and index finger, then hook threads underneath from the opposite side.  Then hold them between the pinky and ring finger, and gently pull your hand so you see all threads emerge.  If necessary, cut the threads using small scissors or a gentle scalpel.
Thread the needle and draw out all the threads until they rise above the conjunctiva. Do not cut the threads abruptly; if tears and blood mix, it will make things difficult (get smeared) for you.
Then cut with scissors any threads extending beyond the eyelid, both above and below, so that only those on the cornea remain.  If you can carefully lift the remaining threads off the cornea with the needle, that's better, although it might not be possible in every case.
If you cut them, the area will be irritated for several days, alleviating the pain and swelling.  Then repeat the procedure.
Chapter Nineteen.
In returning the nasal septum.
Doctors call the septum a "nasura" if, after treating it with cauterization or a strong, burning medicine as previously described, it does not heal.  The only remedy in such a case is to incise the swelling when it is ripe and to remove all the moisture or pus within.
Until the bone is exposed. If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness on it, scrape it clean with an instrument of this shape:
The instrument is called a "khashna al-ras." It is made of Indian iron and has a round head like a button. It is engraved with fine grooves, like a file or a scraper.  Place it on the corrupted part of the bone and rotate it between your fingers while gently squeezing your hand, until you know that the corruption has been removed.
Do this several times, then bind the area with dry, astringent remedies.  If the area heals and flesh grows back, and the discharge stops, and it remains for forty days without recurrence, without discharge, or any new problem.
Therefore, know that it has healed.  Otherwise, there is no other recourse than to return the nasal septum to its original opening in this way: expose the bone again with an iron instrument or a strong medicine.  Once the bone is exposed, take a probe like this:
The tip of the iron instrument should be triangular, and its shaft conical, tapered towards the end, as you see.  Place it on the bone itself, near the nostril, with your hand slightly away from the eye.  Then, turn your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
If he finds air escaping when he holds his hand over his nose, then bind the area with dry, astringent remedies, as I have instructed you.  If the flesh grows back and the area hardens, then the matter that was protruding outwards will return to the nose, making it easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Concerning the reduction of a protruding eye.
If the entire eye protrudes and there is no damage or loss of vision, then you should ease the patient, then push it back into the eye socket, then place a cupping glass on the back of the neck without restrictions and gently suction it.
Then place a poultice made of acacia, aloes, frankincense, and centaury on the eye.  Then secure the eye from above on the bandage with many layers of padding.  The method for the padding is to take many soft strips of cloth, fold each strip into four layers and make many such strips.
Then place them one upon another, as much as needed for the eye.  Then secure them with a firm bandage, tightly.  Repeat the cupping with suctioning, without restrictions. Then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the ligaments relax during this time, you must tighten them again. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, then do so, otherwise, repeat the bandage, padding, tightening, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On cutting the optic nerve.
If a rupture occurs in the sclera, and the eye protrudes, appearing like the optic nerve, and this disfigures the person, and you want to cut it, then the operation is as I describe.
Insert a needle into the root of the optic nerve from below to above. Then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the tear, passing through it, leaving the first needle in place.
Then cut the place where the doubled thread bends, and tie some of the optic nerve around the needle and tighten it firmly. Then remove the needle and place on the eye wool moistened with egg white, and leave it until the threads fall away with the optic nerve, then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Until the wound heals, the optic nerve may be tightened from all sides with a circular bandage until the eye protrudes firmly.  Then, with a thin scalpel, probe deep into the eye, so that the whitish fluid drains and the eye descends and withers in position, then tighten it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of the [eye] socket.
This ailment, called the socket, is a collection of fluid in the eye that resembles descending water, but is not.  The procedure is to have the patient sit upright on a chair, and then take hold of their head from both sides with your hands.
Move it until you see the fluid descend with your eyes, then hold it still, so that it doesn't move, and the light will emerge, and the patient will see things as they used to.  If it does not descend, we know that it is water. If the fluid does not descend as described,
Otherwise, have the patient sit before you, then take a slender scalpel and make a small incision just above the cornea where the conjunctiva touches the cornea in the limbus, so that the matter may come out.
If it comes out, drop warm water, mixed with honey, or water boiled with licorice and honey, into the eye, then treat with other methods until it is healed.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have mentioned the types of water in the classification, and which are suitable for drops, with detailed and explained descriptions.  Take from there what is correct.  Then, the patient should sit before you, seated facing the light, near the sun.
Tie and firmly hold the sound eye, then raise the eyelid with your left hand if the watery eye is the left one, or with your right hand if it is the right one.
Then place the tip of the applicator near the limbus, with the thickness of a millet seed, on the white of the eye, on the side of the smaller eyelid, and then push the applicator firmly while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel the applicator has reached an empty space.
The applicator should proceed to a depth corresponding to the distance from the pupil to the edge of the iris (limbus). The copper is seen by the observer as if it were in the same plane as the eye due to the clarity of the cornea.  Then, the applicator should be raised to the position where the water is located.
Then press it downwards repeatedly. If the water comes out immediately, the patient will see what has been revealed to their sight immediately, with the applicator in their eye, and then rest a little. If the water rises, lower it again without removing the applicator.
If it settles and does not rise, gently remove the applicator by slightly twisting your hand.  Then dissolve a little pure Andronan salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then apply moist cotton or gauze to the entire outside of the eye.
With rose oil and egg white, and bind the healthy eye. As for us and the people of our time, we place ground cumin with egg white on it. If the applicator does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes. It is necessary to take the scalpel called the *bayrid*, which has this form/image.
Pierce only the adhering tissue with it, do not penetrate deeply.  Instead, gently pierce the applicator in a suitable place, then insert the applicator as previously described.  When your work is complete, prepare a secure, darkened room for the patient to lie on their back.
He should refrain from all movements and coughing. Give him food that softens his nature, and do not allow him to move his head to the right or left at all. The bandage remains in place for three days. Then, in that darkened room, remove it and test his sight.
Show him objects, then reapply the bandage for seven days.  You should not do this during the treatment or after the applicator is removed, but rather, avoid it until the water has quickly risen with the great intensity of sight.
If a hot swelling appears, the eye should be released before the seventh day, and treat the swelling in a way that relieves it. Once the swelling subsides, then release the sight, place a cloth over the face so that it trains the sight from underneath, for a number of days, in the darkened room. Then...
He is gradually released from the room and allowed to manage his affairs.  Know that the learner cannot dispense with observing the procedure multiple times before undertaking the procedure.  I have heard some Iraqis say that they make a hollow applicator in Iraq that draws out water.
I have not seen anyone in our country do this, nor have I read it in any book of the ancients.  It may be a recent development.  Here are images of different types of applicators, for him to learn about their forms.
It is made of copper, specifically.  Its tip is precisely this thin, triangular shape, with a sharp point.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On treating flesh growing in the nose.
Various superfluous fleshy growths may sprout in the nose, some resembling a scorpion with many legs, others cancerous, hard, and dark-colored, and still others soft and not dark-colored.
For those fleshy growths that are soft, not malignant or cancerous, the patient should sit facing the sun, open their nostril, insert the forceps into the growth, pull it outward, then cut off the part grasped with a gentle, sharp scalpel on one side.
So that you know that all the flesh is gone; if any part remains uncut, scrape it off gently with a delicate instrument, until nothing is left, lest you be overwhelmed by blood or a hot tumor appear.
If it is a malignant tumor, then immediately cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone.  Then, after the excision, place vinegar and water or a drink in the nose, so that the nose opens, and moisture flows from it into the throat.
Know then that it is healed; if the moisture does not flow properly, know that there is a fleshy growth inside, on the upper, porous bones, which the instrument did not reach during excision.  In that case, a thick linen thread should be taken.
Make many knots on it, placing each knot a finger-width apart or less. The patient should manipulate the end of the thread into their nose with a probe or any available tool, shaped like a button.  Pull on the thread to reach the nostrils.
It will come out through their throat.  Children often do this in school; it is easy for those who wish to do it. Then gather the two ends of the thread—the one that came out of the mouth and the one remaining in the nose.
Then, using the knots on the thread, dissect the flesh.  Do this until you see that the flesh has been severed by the thread's knots.  Then remove the thread.  Place the thread, which has been soaked in Egyptian ointment, in the nose after cleaning the blood.  Do this for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all remaining flesh.  Finally, a lead tube is placed in the nose for a few days until healed.  If further drying treatment is needed, use that.
This is an image of the instrument used to drip ointments and medicines into the nose.
It is made of silver or copper, like a small, open lamp, with a channel for the medicine.
And if you wish, make the tube closed, like a reed, and flatten the instrument's applicator.
It has a handle at the end, as you see, to hold it when heating the ointment or any other liquid substances.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Warts often grow on the tip of the nose, increasing in size and number over time, until their appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and remove it completely.  Then, apply either cautery or a burning medicine that acts as cautery to the area.  If it is left until it grows large, examine it.  If it is hard, stony, dark-coloured, and insensitive,
do not use iron on it, for it is a cancerous tumor.  I have often seen that cutting such a tumor brings great harm to the patient.  If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you judge that it can be completely removed by cutting, then thoroughly excise and cut it without hesitation or delay. Treat the area with something that dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear. If its connection is disrupted by a wound or the like, know that when a disruption of connection occurs in any of these cartilages, rarely does the treatment succeed, except in some people.
Therefore, if one of these things happens to someone, first see if the wound is fresh with blood.  If so, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures, and then treat it until it heals. If the disruption of connection has separated the edges and each gap is sound, then it is necessary to scrape each gap with the thickness of its visible skin until it bleeds.
Then, bring the edges together with sutures, tighten them, and sprinkle powdered shiyān and lubān on them.  Place a plaster of palm ointment, or other gluing ointments, on top.  Leave it tightened for two or three days, then loosen it.
And change the medicine, leaving it until the threads break on their own. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The method of suturing is to bring together the disrupted connection either with needles, as we described in the suturing of the abdomen, or with thread, as I explained there.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
On removing knots that appear on the lips.
Many people may develop small, hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling gooseberry seeds, others smaller or larger.  It is necessary to turn back the lip and cut each knot, extracting it with forceps.
Cut it from all sides, then fill the area after cutting with powdered alum until the bleeding stops. Then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas with astringents until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
On cutting excess flesh in the gums.
Excess flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called *aphol*.  It should be grasped with forceps or a dissector, cut at its base, and allowed to bleed.  Then powdered alum should be placed on the area.
Or one of the drying astringents.  If that flesh returns after treatment, it often does.  Cut it again and cauterize it, as it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-nine.
On cleaning teeth with an iron instrument.
Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums.  They may darken, yellow, or turn green, causing decay to reach the gums and disfigure the teeth.
The patient should sit before you, head resting on your lap.  Remove the tartar and sand-like material from the tooth where you see scales, until nothing remains.  Do the same with any discoloration, such as blackness, greenness, or yellowness, until the tooth is clean.
If the cleaning is successful from the first attempt, then it is fine. Otherwise, repeat the cleaning the next day, and again on subsequent days, until the desired result is achieved.  Know that teeth require various instruments of different shapes, according to the task at hand.
Because the instrument used to clean the inside of a tooth is different from the one used for the outside, and the one used for between the teeth is of a different shape.  You should have a variety of instruments prepared.
Chapter Thirty.
On the extraction of teeth.
One should attempt to alleviate the toothache with every possible method, and delay extraction if possible, for there is no recovery after extraction as it is a precious substance.  Only if extraction is absolutely necessary should it be performed.
If the patient insists on extraction, one must be certain that the tooth's pain is definitively present. Often, the patient is deceived by the pain, believing it is in a healthy tooth and extracting it, then the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth is extracted. We have seen this happen repeatedly with barbers.
If you are certain the pain is in the specific tooth, then you should use a strong forceps to cut around the gum on all sides.  Then, gently move the tooth, bit by bit, with your fingers or fine forceps, until it loosens.
Then, firmly grasp the tooth with the large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees so it does not move.  Pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of the instruments and gently insert it under the tooth on all sides, moving it as you did initially.
If the tooth is decayed or has a hole, you should fill the hole with a cloth and seal it tightly with a thin, strong material to prevent it from fracturing when you apply force with the forceps.  Carefully cut around the gum on all sides.
Use caution to avoid breaking the tooth, as a piece remaining would cause the patient further harm, greater than the initial pain.  Avoid the actions of ignorant barbers who extract teeth without using the methods described.
They often inflict great harm on people; the least of which is a broken tooth, with the roots remaining whole or partially. Or, the tooth may be pulled out with some of the jawbone, as we have seen repeatedly.  After extraction, the patient should rinse the area with a drink, vinegar, or salt water.  If bleeding occurs, as is often the case, then pulverize some alum and apply it to the area.
Otherwise, if the alum does not help, use a delicate forceps.  The forceps should have long handles and short grips, and be thick to prevent bending when grasping the tooth.  This is a picture of the large forceps.
The handles should be thick, so that when you grasp them, they do not yield or bend.  The tips should be short.  Make them of Indian iron or tempered steel, with the tips firmly joined together, interlocking like teeth for a secure grip.
The tips can also be shaped like a file, which also provides a strong grip.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On extracting tooth roots and removing fractured jawbones.
If, during tooth extraction, a root breaks off, you should apply cotton soaked in oil for a day or two to relax the area, then insert forceps or pliers. Which resemble the beak of a bird called a bulerge.  This is the image of the pliers.
If it is not effective to remove it with these pliers, then you should excavate around the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert the instrument resembling a small lever, which is pictured here.
Short, slightly thick at the end, and not pointed, lest it breaks. If the root is removed by this, otherwise use these other instruments, the image of which is here: The first is triangular at the end, with some thickness.
Another delicate triangular image.
We may also use this two-pronged instrument, which is also pictured here.
And with other instruments and tools mentioned in the description of the teeth. We may also use this instrument resembling a large fish hook, which is pictured here.
Triangular, bent at the end, with some slight thickness, lest it breaks, and do not make it pointed.  Know that instruments for the teeth are many, and likewise all other instruments are almost countless. A skilled craftsman, with his craft, may invent instruments for himself according to what the work and the illnesses themselves indicate.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not describe instruments, due to the diversity of their types. If a bone of the jaw or of one of the bones of the mouth breaks or decays, search for it in its place with what is appropriate from among these instruments and pliers mentioned in the extraction of roots.
We use this forceps, a picture of which is shown here.
It should have some slight thickness to hold the bone and prevent it from slipping until it is removed, and we treat the area with appropriate medications. If the bone has a slight decay, remove its decay and darkness until it is clean and then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-two.
In the extraction of erupting teeth.
If teeth erupt in a way that is not natural, their appearance becomes undesirable, especially in women and slaves.  Therefore, it should be examined. If a tooth has grown behind another tooth...
If it cannot be extracted or repositioned, remove it.  If it is attached to another tooth, cut it off using this instrument, which is depicted here:
It resembles a small beak, made of sharp, Indian steel.  Cut it in several days, due to the tooth's hardness, so as not to dislodge other teeth.  If it is protruding and firmly rooted, cool it with an Indian file, which is depicted as follows.
It should be entirely of Indian steel, with very fine engravings. It should be like the file used to make needles.  Cool the tooth little by little over many days, gently, so as not to dislodge and drop it. Then smooth it further and scrape it with some scrapers.
If a tooth has broken off, causing pain to the tongue when speaking, it should also be cooled until the roughness of the fracture disappears, and it becomes smooth, no longer hurting the tongue or disturbing speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In securing loose teeth with silver or gold thread.
If old teeth become loose and shift due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot eat anything for fear of them falling out, and treatment with astringent medicines has been ineffective.
The solution is to tie them with gold or silver thread. Gold is better because silver tarnishes and rots after a few days, whereas gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of medium thickness and thinness, just enough to fit between the teeth.
The method of securing is to take the thread, and insert its loop between the two sound teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, one or more, until weaving reaches the sound tooth on the other side.
Then, repeat the weaving back to the starting side, pulling gently and judiciously so that they do not shift.  Tie the thread tightly at the tooth roots to prevent it from coming loose.  Then cut the excess thread with scissors, tie the ends together and twist them with a file, hiding them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
So as not to injure the tongue.  Then leave it tied like this as long as it remains.  If it loosens or breaks, tie it with another thread.  He will enjoy it like this for all time.  This is the image of the teeth and the method of weaving in two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
A single or two teeth may return to their place after falling out, and be secured as described, and remain.  Only a skilled artisan can do this.  They may also carve bone from the ox, shaping it to resemble a tooth and place it in the socket from which the tooth has disappeared. And ties it, as we said, so it remains and is enjoyed.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On severing the ligament that appears beneath the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament that appears beneath the tongue may be either natural, present at birth, or accidental, from a wound that has healed.
The procedure is to open the patient's mouth, hold their head in your lap, and lift their tongue.  Then, sever the nerve ligament transversely so the tongue is released from its constraint.  If there is some stiffness or entanglement, and this is from a healed wound, insert a blunt instrument and slice it across until the ligament is severed and the knots are loosened.
Be careful not to cut too deeply into the flesh, and sever an artery, causing bleeding.  Then, after the cut, rinse the area with rosewater or vinegar and cold water.  Then place a linen wick under the tongue, for the patient to hold in place each night.
To prevent reattachment.  If bleeding occurs, apply powdered alum to the area.  If the bleeding is profuse, cauterize the area with a suitable lentil-shaped cautery iron. Then treat it with other remedies until healed.
Chapter Thirty-five.
Removing the toad that has formed under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small toad may form under the tongue, hindering its normal function.  It may even enlarge, filling the mouth.  The procedure is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the tumor.
If it appears dark or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation, do not attempt treatment, for it is cancer.  If it is tending toward a whitish color with moisture, use a forceps to grasp and carefully split it with a fine scalpel, removing it from all sides.
If bleeding occurs during the procedure, apply powdered borax until the bleeding stops. Then resume the procedure until the tumor is completely removed. Finally, have the patient gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other appropriate treatments until healed.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On the treatment of tonsil tumors.
Any tumors growing in the throat may present glands inside the throat resembling the glands that appear externally, called tonsils.  If treatment as described in the division did not bring healing.
If the tumor is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive, do not use the iron.  If it is red and thick, do not use the iron either, for fear of blood loss.  Instead, let it mature, and it will either soften or burst on its own.
If it is white, round, and thin, this is what should be cut.  Before doing so, observe if its inflammatory swelling has completely subsided or if some of the swelling has decreased.
Then, have the patient sit facing the sun, head resting on your lap, mouth open.  Take an assistant, and have them press the patient's tongue downwards with an instrument, of this form:
Made of silver or copper, thin like a knife.  When you press the tongue with this and the tumor is clear and visible, take a probe and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it outward as much as possible, without pulling any of the membranes with it.
Then cut it with an instrument, like a pair of scissors, but with both ends bent so that the tips of each are extremely sharp.  Made of Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel, of this form:
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other.  After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner.  Then, after the cut, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, he should gargle with water in which pomegranate rind or rue leaves, or similar astringents, have been boiled, until the bleeding stops.  Then treat it until healed.  Other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils, and these are cut in the same way as the tonsils.
I treated a woman for a tumor that had grown inside her throat, approaching the size of a small, rather insensitive lump, which nearly blocked the throat.  The woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and the tumor had prevented her from eating and drinking.
She was close to death if she had remained alive for another day or two.  The tumor had grown two branches which extended to her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserting a hook into one of them, pulling it, and a suitable piece came away.
Then I cut it where it emerged from the nostril, then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril.  Then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut off some of it.  Only a small amount of blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began drinking water and eating.  We continued to cut away from that tumor repeatedly for a long time, and the tumor would grow back after what we cut away, until this task consumed both me and her.
I then cauterized the tumor inside the throat, hoping to stop its growth. Then I left the area. I do not know what God did for her after I left.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On the removal of a tumor of the larynx.
If a tumor, called *'unba'* descends to the larynx and swells, and is white and oblong, it is called a *'amud'*; but if it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called *'unba'*. If treated as mentioned in the division, and the treatment is not successful...
If the hot tumor has subsided and it is thin, it should be cut. But if it is a collected, round mass without length, and is blood-red, dark-red or black, or without feeling, then its excision should be avoided.
For there is risk to the patient. Therefore, if you see it with the characteristics described, whiteness and length, the patient should sit facing the sun, and his tongue should be pressed with the instrument whose description is previously given. Then the hook should be inserted into the *'unba'*.
Pull it downward and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned for cutting the tonsils.  Only the portion exceeding the natural limit should be cut, without further removal, for if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after the cutting, use what we described for the cutting of the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is reluctant to have it cut, then a cauterization should be employed without fear or caution. The method of cauterization is with a sharp medicine, and the patient's head should be placed in your lap.
Then, press the patient's tongue with the instrument we mentioned, then take the sharp water, mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with quicklime, making it neither thick nor thin. Fill the depression of this instrument with it, and this is its shape.
The end of the instrument, where the medicine is placed, has a depression like the depression of a *mard* spoon.  Place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself.  The patient should lie on his side, so saliva may drain from his mouth from inside his throat to avoid anything going back into his throat and harming him.
Then, hold the instrument containing the medicine and apply pressure to the uvula for about half an hour, until you see it blackened and the burning of the medicine subsides. If you prefer, take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the end of a *mard* spoon, and soak the cotton in the medicine.
Insert the *mard* spoon with the cotton into the tube from above, so that the cotton adheres to the uvula. Repeat this several times until you have achieved the desired cauterization of the uvula.  Then leave it; it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, do so.
After cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in clarified butter, removing any remaining medicine. Then, the patient should rinse his mouth with cool water.  Treatment should also be applied externally with lotions and internally with gargles until healed.  This type of treatment is safer than surgery and avoids fear.
The uvula can also be treated with gentler methods than cauterization and surgery, using incense in this manner:  Take frankincense, saffron, sage, fumitory, wormwood, chamomile, and *qaysum*, and other similar herbs. Combine all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
Bring it to a boil, the pot sealed with earthenware, and a hollow tube is placed in the middle of the lid. This tube is made of silver or copper.
Insert the end of the tube, which contains the pomegranate, into the patient's mouth so that the steam ascends to the uvula through the tube, causing the uvula to contract.  Repeat this several times until it withers.  Avoid using this treatment at the very onset of the swelling.
For it often aggravates the swelling.  Instead, one should do this when the hot swelling has subsided.  If you do not have this instrument, take a hollow tube and fit a piece of eggshell to the end of it to prevent burning the patient's mouth.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth.  This is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other foreign objects lodged in the throat.
Often a bone, fish thorn, or other foreign object lodges in the throat.  One should remove any visible object that can be seen, after pressing the tongue down with an instrument, in the light.
To make clear what is in the throat.  If something is hidden in the throat, you should induce vomiting before the patient's food has digested in the stomach.  Perhaps the foreign object will be expelled through vomiting, or the patient might swallow a piece of cloth or a stem of a vegetable.
Or a piece of dry bread, or you take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a thread, and have the patient swallow it. When it reaches the location of the thorn, pull the thread quickly.  Do this repeatedly.
Often the thorn or bone adheres to it and comes out. If it does not come out by the methods mentioned, then use an instrument made of lead, in this manner:
It should be slightly thicker than a reed.  At its tip, there is a curve, which the patient inserts into their throat gently, with their head raised upward, carefully avoiding touching their throat so as not to cause coughing, and pushing out the bone or thorn, or the physician inserts it with their hand.
Having the patient insert it is better, because they know the location of the foreign object.  Push downward or pull upward with the instrument, as is appropriate, until it is removed.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
Removing a leech lodged in the throat.
If you have treated the leech using the medications mentioned in the previous section, and it is unsuccessful, then look into the patient's throat in the light of the sun, after pressing the tongue down with the instrument described to you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a gentle, firm forceps. If that is not successful, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech. Then, insert a heated, protected iron rod into the tube.
Do this several times.  The patient should abstain from water all day.  Then, he should take a jar full of cool water, open his mouth over it, rinse with it, and not swallow a drop.  He should move the water with his hand from time to time.
If the leech feels the water, it will fall off. If it does not come out as described, fumigate the throat with urine and with hydromel using the instrument described in the section on fumigation of the larynx. Do this several times, and it will fall off.
The method for fumigation is to take a vessel containing embers heated by fire, and the vessel covered with a lid having a hole in the center.  Place the end of the instrument in that hole.  Then, put the incense into the vessel, and the patient places his mouth at the end of the tube.  He closes his mouth to prevent the incense from escaping, until he is sure that it has reached his throat.
If the leech falls off at this stage, if not, the fumigation is repeated several times.  The patient endures thirst and eats salty things and garlic, and does not drink water.  It is necessary that the leech comes out with this procedure. This is the form of the instrument for pulling the leech from the throat if it is visible.
It resembles pincers, as you see, except that it has this bend that enters the throat, and its ends resemble a bird's mouth.  There is the roughness of a file on them, so if it grasps something, it does not let go.
Another instrument is used to press the tongue; it is a wide ring of iron, sized to fit the mouth over the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, keeping the mouth open against the patient's will.  He cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument that opens the mouth in this exact manner.
Chapter Forty.
In it, there is discussion of the lancing and incision of tumors.
Tumors are numerous and varied, each described individually in this book.  They differ in lancing and incision in two ways: one is the nature of the tumor itself, and the other is the humors it contains.
The second type differs according to the locations in the body where they occur.  A tumor occurring in the head is not the same as one occurring in the buttocks, and a tumor in fleshy tissue differs from one in a joint. Each requires specific treatment.
Some tumors should not be lanced until the pus has matured and is fully formed.  Others, such as those near the joints, should be lanced while still unripe and incompletely matured.
Because if a tumor near a joint grows until it causes the surrounding tissue to putrefy, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing the limb to become useless, or the tumor may be close to a vital organ.
Because if you delay lancing it until it matures, you will harm the vital organ, or if it is near the buttocks, you should lance it while it is still unripe.  It is necessary to lance an unripe tumor near the buttocks to prevent the pus from spreading deep into the buttocks, causing a fistula.
And it will become incurable to a degree.  You must know when to lance fully matured tumors, when the tumor pain subsides, the fever is gone, redness and throbbing are reduced, the head of the tumor softens, and other symptoms diminish.
The incision should be made at the lowest part of the tumor if possible, to facilitate the drainage of pus downwards, or at the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor.  If the tumors are on the hands or feet, the incision should be made lengthwise.
And the areas of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries—in short, all flat, non-flexing areas.  In flexing areas, the incision should follow the contours of the area.  If the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is best to leave it unlanced.
Until its maturation is complete, as we said. If you lance it before then, the pus discharge will be prolonged, causing much harm and dirtiness.  The edges and depths of the tumor might become hardened. Some tumors may be incised across the body, if necessary, or according to the needs of the affected limb.
Small tumors should be incised once, while large tumors require a wide incision or several incisions, commensurate with the tumor's size.  Some tumors may need to have the skin cauterized or cut away if they have become like a rag.
Some have, to a degree, died, as occurs in many swellings and abscesses.  Some are incised with a three-angled cut, and others are cut like a rue leaf, such as the scrotal tumor.
Some require a circular or crescent-shaped incision, and similar cuts.  If the tumor lacks a head, like a smooth, flat tumor, a simple incision is sufficient.  If the tumor is large, has accumulated for a long time, and has been incised, one should not rush to drain all the pus at once.
Instead, drain some of it, then press the swelling back for a day, and then drain some more pus.  Repeat this process gradually until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an elderly person, the animal spirit often weakens with a sudden discharge of pus.  The patient might die without you realizing it, so be extremely cautious in this regard.
After incising these tumors, you should cleanse the wound and examine it. If the tumor wound is small or the incision is simple, use lint or worn cotton. If the tumor is large and the incisions numerous,
Then you should insert a wick into each incision until they meet.  If the tumor has cut or eroded some of the skin, you should fill it with worn cotton or linen fibers, without moisture, and hold it in place for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, soaked into a linen cloth, and apply it to the bleeding spot repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the treatments and remedies described in many places in this book, and in the sections on classification. If it is winter and the tumor area is highly sensitive, you should soak the bandages in warm drink and oil.
And apply them to the area.  If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply bandages soaked in water and oil or in cold drink and oil, until the third day, as we said, when you should then release the tumor and cleanse it.
And use similar treatments until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the detailed method, each tumor has been described, how to treat it, in a summarized, categorized way.
Chapter Forty-one.
On the incision of tumors that appear on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp, a type of swelling contained within membranes.  They resemble a hen's egg, and their types are numerous; some are fatty, others contain moisture like mud.
Some contain moisture like broth and soup, and similar things; others are hardened and solid.  All can be incised and removed without danger, unless a blood vessel is encountered during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument, whose image will follow after this, called the *mudass*, so as to learn what they contain. If they contain moisture, incise them lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from line ~B~ to line ~C~.  If the moisture has drained, dissect and remove the sac containing the moisture entirely. Do not leave any part of it, for it frequently recurs if any remains.
Then dip a cotton swab in the astringent ointment, if available, or in salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it until the next day, as it will consume any remaining sac. Then, reapply the cotton swab with the astringent a second and third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that no part of the sac remains.  Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains fatty tissue, incise it in this manner:
Make a deep incision, and insert forceps into the edges of the wound.  Dissecting from all sides, make every effort to remove the membrane containing it. If an artery is encountered, proceed as described previously.  Likewise, proceed with the swelling if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as previously mentioned.  The incision on a hardened swelling is easier, because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these swellings in the head in some people have absolutely no moisture. I incised a swelling in...
The head of an elderly woman, and found the swelling as hard as stone, rough, white, and unbreakable.  If someone were to throw it, it would shatter.  Other swellings occurring in the head, unlike those in children, are not like this.
At the origins of the ears, make a simple incision across the entire area, and create a pathway from the bottom to allow the material to flow downwards. Then treat it with the appropriate remedy.
Chapter Forty-Two.
Concerning the incision on swine-like swellings that often appear in the neck. These swellings frequently appear in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin. They may appear elsewhere on the body.  Sometimes, a single swelling appears in the neck; other times, there are many, and some develop from others.
Each such swelling exists within its own membrane, like those in merchandise and head tumors, as we described.  There are many types of these swellings, some stony, some containing moisture, and some malignant and unresponsive to treatment.
Those that I found favorable to touch, whose appearance was close to the skin color, moved in all directions, and were not attached to the neck's nerve, tendon, or artery, and were not deeply embedded. Therefore, a simple incision should be made from top to bottom of the body, along the line from ~J~ to line ~B~.
Peel it away from all sides, and stretch the edges of the skin with a hook or two or many hooks, if needed, as we said for head tumors.  Remove it little by little, being careful not to sever a vein or nerve. The scalpel should not be excessively sharp.
So that your hand does not cause excessive cutting or unsettle the patient, cutting what you do not need to cut.  If you sever a vein or artery and are prevented from continuing, then place pulverized alum or some of the styptics which stop bleeding into the wound.
Tighten the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides, the wound relaxes, and it is about to fester.  Then the bleeding will stop, and you can resume your work until it is finished.  Then, examine with your index finger if there are any remaining, smaller pieces, and remove them.
If a large vein is found at the base of the piece, you should not cut it off at its base, but should tie it with a doubled and tight thread and leave it until it falls out on its own without harm.  Then, fill the wound with used cotton, having soaked it in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
If you have cut away the entire piece, you should bring the edges of the wound together and stitch it immediately, after ensuring that there is absolutely no residue left. If you find a remaining part of the piece of flesh, it is necessary to do this.
You should aim for the base and root of the piece with the cuts, and employ the sutures and what we have mentioned.  For pieces containing moisture, apply a simple bandage where you see their point of ripeness, and make the bandage from below, as we have said.
Then, after the bandage, apply a poultice of Egyptian ointment, or similar, to consume any remaining corruption. Once you see the wound is clean, treat it with healing ointments until it is healed.
Chapter Forty-three.
On slitting the throat for a tumor occurring within the throat.
The ancients mentioned this slitting of the throat, but I have seen no one in our country perform it.  This follows their words.  As for those with sore throats, one should avoid slitting the throat, as it is of no benefit.
In order that all tumors and lungs may be diseased; but those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if the trachea is not affected, then slitting the throat is necessary to escape the harm of suffocation.
Therefore, if we wish to do this, we should slit the throat below three rings of the trachea or four small slits horizontally between two rings, as wide as the slit in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This is the appropriate place for the slit.
Because it lacks flesh and its blood vessels are distant, if the surgeon is timid, he should extend the throat skin with a hook and then slit the skin until, when he reaches the trachea, he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should slit the peritoneum that we have described, and evidence for slitting the trachea is the phlegm that comes from it with what is punctured and the cessation of sound. He should leave the wound open for a time.  When the time during which suffocation was feared has passed, he should bring together the edges of the wound from the skin.
And he cuts along the line alone, without the cartilage. Then the medications that promote flesh growth are used until it heals.  The author of this book says, in explanation of this passage, that this is what is done if they see that the patient's throat is obstructed by one of these tumors that we have mentioned.
When the patient was close to death, and feared asphyxiation, they proceeded to slit the throat so that the patient might breathe through the wound and be saved from death.  However, they were instructed to leave the wound open until the illness's course was completed, which usually takes three days or so.
At that point, they were instructed to stitch the wound and treat it until it healed.  What I personally observed was that a servant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, severing a portion of her lung's trachea. I was called to treat her, and found her weakening as if she had been slain. I uncovered the wound.
I found that the blood coming from the wound was minimal, so I became certain that she had not severed an artery or vein. Air was escaping from the wound.  I quickly sutured the wound and treated it until it healed.  The servant experienced nothing further than a slight hoarseness in her voice.
And after a few days, she returned to her best condition.  Therefore, we say that slitting the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the incision of the tumor that appears on the larynx from the outside, and which is called the laryngeal tumor.
This tumor, called a laryngeal tumor, is a large tumor the color of the body.  It is common in women and comes in two types.
Either it is natural or accidental.  As for the natural one, there is no remedy.  As for the accidental one, it is of two kinds: one like fatty tumors, and the other like the tumor that arises from arterial blockage.  In incising it, there is danger. Therefore, one should not use a knife at all, unless it is small. If you probe and examine it with a probe and find that it resembles a fatty tumor and is not connected to any vessels, then incise it as one would a tumor. And remove it with the sac that contains it, if it is in a sac. Otherwise, remove it completely, then treat the area with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-five.
On incising various tumors.
Tumors are of many types, and all their types have been mentioned in the classification.  Here, we must explain the difference between a tumor and an abscess, for this is problematic. I say that an abscess presents with fever, intense pain, and frightening sensations until the heat subsides. And when the pus is complete, then the fever and intensity subside. A tumor does not present with fever, pain, or inflammation. It is contained within a serous sac, a special casing, and is the same color as the body. Its initial stage resembles a lentil, then it becomes like a fig, larger or smaller.
It is of two types: either fatty or containing moisture. The colors of moisture are numerous, as mentioned in the classification. Therefore, when treating a tumor, one must first probe and examine it using the instrument called a 'midas' (or 'probe'), as its image will be found in the following chapter.
Estimate the size of the tumor, then withdraw the probe and observe what follows. If a liquid substance of any color is expelled, incise it with a simple incision, as described for other tumors. If no liquid follows the probe, know that it is fatty.
Incise it with a dissecting incision, as I have taught you, and suspend it by forceps. Carefully dissect the skin from all sides. If possible, extract the sac containing the tumor intact.
If the sac ruptures during the procedure and you cannot remove it intact, which frequently occurs, then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. If any part remains, however small, the tumor is likely to recur.
If you are unsuccessful and a small portion remains, cauterize the wound with sharp cauterizing agents after you are finished, and stitch it. Apply something to reduce inflammation and treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the tumor is large, suture its edges and treat it to promote healing.
If a vein, whether pulsating or not, obstructs your progress and bleeding occurs, immediately cauterize the affected area with powdered alum, and leave it tightly bound for two or three days until the wound becomes festered and the blood flow subsides. Then proceed to remove any remaining portion of the tumor.
Chapter Forty-Six.
In the images of instruments.
Which deal with the incision and extraction, among them are the images of probes, which are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
Made of tempered steel, square-ended, and tightly fitting to swiftly enter tumors.  These are the images of probes, also called "colds," and they are also of three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
It is suitable for probing tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities to discover what is within them, such as bones, and so on. It is made round, polished, and smooth like a whetstone, from Chinese brass, or from asphodel, or from copper, or from iron, or from silver. The best of them are those made from asphodel.
Probes can also be made of black lead, and they are suitable for probing fistulas that have a bend in their recesses, as they can bend gently with the bend.  They are also of three types, with some long, some medium, and some short.
To the extent necessary for the recess of each fistula, and their thickness is made according to the spaciousness or narrowness of the fistula. Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks.  There are many types, including simple ones with a single hook, which come in large, medium, and small sizes.  There are also blind hooks, in three types, and double-hooked hooks, also in three types, and double-hooked curved hooks. There are three types, and among them are three-hooked hooks, also in three types.  Each of these types needs its own specific place.  Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium-sized simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.
Image of a large blind hook. Image of a medium-sized blind hook.
Image of a small blind hook.
Image of a large double-hooked probe. Image of a medium-sized double-hooked probe. Image of a small double-hooked probe.
Image of a large three-hooked probe.
Image of a medium-sized three-hooked probe. Image of a small three-hooked probe.
These are images of scalpels used to cut and excise tumors and growths.  There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium-sized scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its cutting edges are limited, while the other edges are not,  so that it can be used to excise a growth cautiously, to avoid severing a nerve or tendon,  and so that the patient experiences relief from the burning sensation during excision of the tumor.
These are images of bandages.  There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large bandage.
It is made of a copper, almost rod-like material, used for eye-treatment.  On one end, a broad, two-layered spoon-like structure is formed, and within its head, a hidden scalpel blade is positioned, resembling a bird's tongue, which can move inwards and outwards as desired, as you see.
Images of scalpels used to gently excise tumors between the fingers, so the patient does not feel them. There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Images of cupping vessels used to cut off blood flow.  There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large cupping vessel.
They are made of copper or bronze, slightly elongated and rounded, as you see.  They must be thin.  You should have large and small types of these cupping vessels to quickly cut off blood in emergencies, when medication is unavailable.
However, they are not used to cut blood from every part of the body, but only in fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the legs, thighs, arms, breasts, abdomen, and groin, and similar moist fleshy organs.
Other smaller tools can be made from it, resembling pistachio shells, like this image.
Blood can be cut with them if it flows from a vein-opening or from a cut artery or vein.  It can also be made rounded, like this image.
Chapter Forty-seven.
On treating the breast of men.
Some people's breasts may swell at puberty until they resemble women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly.  If one dislikes this, one should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast, in this manner.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~. Then scrape away all the fat, then fill the wound with the medicated ointment, then stitch together the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. If the breast sags and relaxes because of the bone, as happens in women,
Then one should make two crescent-shaped incisions on its upper sides, with each one connecting to the other at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller one, in this manner. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then the skin between the incisions is peeled away, the fat is removed, and the previously mentioned sutures, dressings, and any other necessary treatment are used until it heals.
If the incision does not encompass all that needs to be cut due to the patient's distress or bleeding, then the wound should be packed with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment, left until the remaining fat is consumed, and then treated until healed.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On the treatment of tumors appearing under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the swine variety, solid and enclosed in a sac.  Some contain moisture; those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~.  If all the fluid in the tumor has been drained, pack it with used cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until healed. If the tumor is of the swine cyst type, incise it as we described for cysts of the swine variety. If the wound continues to produce pus, use cauterization as mentioned earlier.
Chapter Forty-nine.
On incising the tumor that appears near the artery or vein, called an aneurysm.
If the artery is injured and the skin above it adheres, a tumor often arises from this.  Similarly, swelling and tumors may also arise in veins.
The signs by which one can tell whether the swelling and puffiness are from an artery or a vein: if it is from the artery, the tumor will be oblong, situated deep within the body, and if you press on the tumor with your finger, you will feel a sort of crackling sensation.
And that from the vein, the tumor will be round and on the surface of the body.  Incision on these tumors is dangerous, especially in the armpit, groin, neck, and many other parts of the body. If they are very large, one should avoid treating them with iron.
And those that are also in the extremities or in the head should be avoided.  If it is an arterial swelling, make a longitudinal incision in the skin, then widen the incision with forceps, then dissect and free the artery from the surrounding tissues.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and pass it to the other side.  Tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I explained to you concerning the arteries in the neck.  Then pierce the area between the ligaments with a lancet until all the blood is released.
The swelling will subside, and then you use a treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is due to a vein rupture, you should grasp as much of the swelling with the skin as possible. Then insert a needle below the area you are holding, and pass it through with a doubled thread, bringing it out from the other side. Then tie the swelling firmly, according to what I have already shown you in tying the knot on both sides of the thread. If you fear the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling where the first needle crosses.
Tie your threads in four places, then cut the swelling open in the middle.  When the contents are expelled, cut away the excess skin and leave what has been tied. Then place a compress soaked in potion and oil on it. Then use the treatment that involves twisting and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
In the swelling that arises from nerve twisting.
As swelling occurs in the artery and vein, so too does swelling occur in the nerve if a blow is sustained or from excessive exertion or the like.  This is more common in the wrists and heels.
And in every location where the joints move, it is a hard swelling, similar in color to the rest of the body.  It is mostly painless.  If pressed firmly, the afflicted person feels a sensation resembling numbness.  The swelling is not concentrated deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, but does not move forward or backward.  For those in the joints, it should not be treated with iron, as it might cause a festering wound.  And for those in the head or forehead...
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the swelling is small, grasp it with a forceps and cut it from the root. If it is large, suspend it with a hook and scrape it off, then remove it and stitch the wound, treating it until it heals.
The Fifty-first Chapter.
Concerning the removal of warts that appear on the abdomen.
Warts, called "fungal" because of their resemblance to fungi, frequently appear on the abdomens and other parts of the body of some people.  Their base is thin and their head thick; sometimes their lips are fused together.  Some are small, others very large.
I observed a man with two warts on his abdomen that resembled fungi in every way.  The bases were thin and white; their lips were fused together, and moisture constantly flowed from them.  I removed them, and their weights were approximately eighteen ounces and six ounces, respectively.
In performing the removal, observe if the affected area is moist and the wart's color is white, moist, and thin-based.  Cut it with a broad scalpel, and have a cautery iron present, as much blood frequently flows during the excision.
If blood flow overwhelms you, cauterize it immediately.  If the affected area is timid and recoils from cutting with the iron, take a strong lead thread and tie it around the wart with this description. Leave it for two days, then increase the tightness of the lead thread, continuing to tighten it.
As it acts upon the wart, it will eventually detach and fall off of its own accord, without further effort. If the wart has a thick base, there is some risk and danger in removing it entirely, particularly if it is in the abdomen. However, it may be possible to remove half or a portion of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and then treat the wound until it heals. Beware of cutting a wart that is dark, insensitive, and unsightly, for it is a cancerous tumor. We will discuss cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
In treating navel growths.
Navel growths can arise from various causes: either from a rupture in the abdominal peritoneum, allowing the intestines or bowels to protrude, as is seen in other hernias; or from blood emanating from a vein or artery, as previously described; or from trapped wind within it.
If it is due to a rupture in the peritoneum and protrusion of the intestines, then the color of the growth will resemble the body's color, it will be soft without pain, and its position will be unusual. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, its position will be even more unusual than what we described. When you press it with your fingers, it will disappear and then reappear.  It may also produce rumbling, and it will often become significantly larger with bathing or strenuous exertion.  If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
If it does not disappear when pressed with your hand, and does not increase or decrease in size, it is likely due to blood.  In this case, the growth will display a bluish-dark coloration. If it is from newly grown flesh, the growth will be firm, hard, and remain constant in size.
If it is due to wind, the touch will be soft.  In such a case, one should refrain from treatment, for there is risk and deception in this, as I informed you in the chapter concerning tumors originating from veins and arteries.
If the protrusion of the navel is due to intestines or viscera, instruct the patient to hold himself still and stand upright, stretched out.  Then, apply compresses around the entire navel. Then, have him lie on his back before you.  Then, make a wide incision around the navel, at the location you marked with the ink.  Then, pull the middle of the growth upwards with a large hook.  Then, tie the incision site with a strong thread or silk thread, in a firm knot.
The knot of the ligature should be a slip knot. Then, open the center of the pulled growth above the ligature, insert your index finger, and search for the intestines. If you find them caught by the ligature, loosen the slip knot and push the intestines back into the abdomen. If you find a viscus, pull it out with a hook.
Cut off the excess. If you encounter a vein or artery, tie it off. Return to your work. Take two needles and thread strong threads through them. Insert the two needles into the incision you made around the growth, deep within it. Then, pull the growth tight at four points on the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the pulled flesh becomes infected and falls off on its own, or cut it when it becomes thin and infected.  Then, treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the protrusion of the navel is from flesh that has grown there.
Or if it is from moisture, you should cauterize the growth, as we said, and remove the blood or moisture found within.  Then, treat it with what will heal the area.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines, and warned against treating it with iron so as not to cause ulcers. We have also mentioned cancer that originates in the uterus and warned against treating it.
The ancients stated that if the cancer is in a place where it can be completely removed, such as cancer in the breast or the thigh, and similar organs from which it can be extracted entirely, especially if it is small and newly formed, however, if it is advanced and large, it should not be approached.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me who achieved that.  If it is advanced, as we said, the procedure should proceed, causing the patient to sweat profusely several times, and then cauterize it if there is a clear fullness in the veins.
Then the patient is placed in a position that allows the procedure, then the appropriate hooks are placed on the cancer, and it is scraped from every side with the skin thoroughly, until nothing of its roots remains.  Allow the blood to flow, do not cut it quickly.
Indeed, squeeze the affected areas and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with any suitable instruments.  If during the procedure a large amount of blood is encountered from a severed artery or vein, constrict the vein until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the treatment of carbuncles.
We have previously discussed the types of dropsy, how water accumulates, the signs of each type, and its treatment with medication.  Only the chronic type of dropsy is treated with iron.  The other types—the phlegmatic and the fleshy types—must not be approached with iron at all.
If you have treated this type of chronic carbuncle with medication and your treatment has not been successful, then consider whether the patient has become extremely weak, or if there is another illness besides the carbuncle, such as.
If the patient has a cough, diarrhea, or similar ailments, avoid treating it with iron.  If you see a patient of sufficient strength, with no illness other than the carbuncle itself, and who is neither a child nor an elderly person, the course of action is to have the patient stand before you. And a servant behind him should grasp his abdomen with his hands and push the water downwards towards the pubic region. Then, a pointed lancet should be used in this manner:
Narrow at both ends, long, and pointed at the tip, like a lancet, but with a slight curve to prevent it from reaching the intestines during use and thus injuring them. Then, observe if the carbuncle has originated from the intestines.
If the carbuncle originated from a disease of the liver, the incision should be three finger-widths to the lower part of the navel and slightly above the pubis. If it arose from a disease of the spleen, the incision should be three finger-widths to the right of the navel.
Also, the incision should not be on the side the patient intends to lie on, to prevent the discharge from flowing to that weak area.  Then, pierce the entire skin with the instrument, and insert the instrument into the incision and lift your hand.
Using the lancet, separate the skin from the peritoneum as if you were peeling it, taking only as much skin as a fingernail or similar. Then pierce the peritoneum until the lancet reaches an empty space, the location of the water. Then remove it and insert the instrument, which is depicted in this way.
It is like a thin tube made of silver, brass, or polished, smooth leather.  At its bottom is a small hole and on its sides three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
A probe, shaped like a pen-like point, may be placed on its tip, in this manner.
At its upper end is a ring. When the instrument reaches the water, it will drain immediately onto the instrument. Drain a moderate amount of water at a time, for if you drain more than necessary in a single time, the patient might die due to the dissolution of their vital spirit.
Or the patient might experience a near-death faint.  However, drain it to the extent of the patient's strength, guided by the patient's pulse and complexion. Then remove the instrument and retain the water, as it is held immediately.
Due to the skin that closes the hole in the peritoneum, which you were told to cover in that manner, then return the instrument another day if you see the patient able to endure it.
Also remove a small amount of water each time.  Do this for several days, keeping a close watch and avoiding mistakes so that only a small amount of water remains. If you fear for the patient's well-being and have left a significant amount of water, treat the patient by burying them in hot sand.
Excessive sweating in a bath or under the sun, enduring thirst, and treating with dried medications until recovery.  Cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as previously described.
Chapter fifty-five.
In the treatment of children born with unperforated or narrow, or improperly positioned, urinary passages.
Some boys may be born with an unperforated urethra.  One should immediately perforate it as soon as born.
With a very thin scalpel, in this manner:
Then place a thin lead pin in the opening, tie it, and hold it for three or four days.  When urination occurs, remove it, and then replace it.  If the lead isn't used, urine passing through the area could cause it to close.
As for those with a narrow opening, it should be treated with lead as described for several days until it widens.  And those whose opening is in the wrong place, some are born with the opening at the end of the urethra, and thus cannot urinate forward.
Until the urethra is lifted by hand upwards.  It is a very serious condition when the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line.  The procedure involves the patient lying on their back.
Then, with your left hand, strongly stretch his urethra, and trim the head of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, as if carving something, so that its center protrudes like a urethra, and the opening is in the center as appropriate.
Take care to avoid bleeding, as it frequently occurs.  Stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
Concerning the ulceration, sores, blackness, decay, and adhesion of the prepuce to the glans.
This ulceration frequently appears in the urethra, as a dark, fleshy swelling.  It can be malignant or benign; benign cases should be treated with a gentle snare.
Cut it completely to cleanse it, then apply a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment, and subsequently treat it with palm ointment until it heals. If the ulcer is malignant, dark-colored, cauterization should be used after cutting and removing the affected tissue.
If the ulcer is on the prepuce of an uncircumcised person, and some of the ulcer is inside and some outside, then the inner ulcer should be removed first.  Once it has healed, treat the outer ulcer.
Because if you treat them both at once, you risk the prepuce perforating.  This can also occur in women, with blackness and decay on the prepuce; all blackened and decaying tissue should be excised.
Then apply honey, powdered and strained pomegranate rind, and karsinna to the area.  Continue treatment until healed.  If bleeding occurs, cauterize with a crescent-shaped cautery iron in this manner:.
Cauterization is beneficial for both bleeding and ulceration of the wound.  If the foreskin is completely consumed by ulceration, a lead tube should be inserted into the urethra so the patient can urinate through it.  As for the adhesion of the prepuce to the glans...
This adhesion occurs in those whose prepuce was healthy and circumcision was not performed, or it may result from a wound or a tumor.  The prepuce should be separated with a sharp scalpel until the ligament is loosened and the glans is completely free.
If it is difficult to distinguish them upon examination, a small portion of the glans and prepuce should be separated.  Since the prepuce is thin, it may easily tear.  Then separate the prepuce and glans using a thin linen cloth moistened with cold water to prevent further adhesion.
Then treat with a styptic drink until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-seven.
In the purification of boys and the treatment of their errors.
Circumcision is nothing more than the separation of a connection, like other surgeries. However, since it is a procedure performed by us, intentionally, and especially on boys, the best course of action must be determined.
The easiest path to safety, I say, is that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because it was not used in their traditions, but is something we have adopted.
Through experience, I found that the majority of surgeons and barbers use purification with knives and scissors, and use thread, ligatures, and cutting with a nail.  I have tried all these methods.
I found nothing better than purification with scissors and tying with thread, because purification with a knife often causes skin damage, since the foreskin has two layers.  Perhaps the upper layer of skin is cut, while the lower layer remains.
One is forced to make another cut, causing further pain.  Purification with a cautery iron carries the risk of cutting the tip of the urethra, as it might have entered the opening.  As for purification with a nail, the skin might tear, ruining your work, or the boy's foreskin might be too short.
Many are born such that they do not require purification, as I have seen.  However, purification with scissors and tying with thread, experience has shown me, is superior, since the scissors have a balanced cut because the blade above is similar to the blade below.
When you grip the scissors with the blades balanced, the cut is even and takes place at the same time.  The tied thread then becomes like a wall around the urethral skin from all sides, with no error.  The procedure should begin by reassuring the boy.
Especially if he is someone who understands a little, that you are merely tying the thread around his urethra and leaving it for another day.  Then, please him and give him joy in any way you can.  What his mind accepts, and then, have him stand before you, upright.
Do not let him sit, and keep the scissors hidden in your sleeve or under your foot.  The boy's eyes should not see them or any of the tools.  Then, insert your hand into his urethra, inflate the foreskin and lift it upwards, until the glans of the urethra is exposed.
Then, clean it from any dirt that may have accumulated.  Then, tie the marked area with a doubled thread.  Then, tie a second thread a little lower.  Then, hold the lower thread firmly with your thumb and forefinger.  Cut between the two threads. Then, lift the foreskin upwards quickly and expose the glans.  Then, let the blood flow a little; this is better and lessens inflammation of the urethra.  Then, wipe it with a damp cloth. Then, dust it with the ash of burnt dried pumpkin, as this is the best I have tried, or with the dust of the charcoal; this is also excellent.
Then, lift the foreskin upwards quickly and expose the glans.  Then, let the blood flow a little; this is better and lessens inflammation of the urethra.  Then, wipe it with a damp cloth. Then, dust it with the ash of burnt dried pumpkin, as this is the best I have tried, or with the dust of the charcoal; this is also excellent. Then, place a boiled egg yolk in rosewater, mixed with soft, fragrant rose oil, in a cloth and bandage over the area.  Leave it for another day.  Then, continue the treatment until he is healed.
This is a suitable scissor design for purification.
The blades should be straight, sharp, and nail-shaped. The blades' lengths should equal the handles' lengths.  An error in the purification process might involve inverting all or part of the retracted skin during the cutting.  One should pull it back with a fingernail before the area becomes swollen.
Cut it [the skin] evenly.  If you can't hold it with a fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it.  If, after three days, the area below the glans remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the inflammation subsides and gently peel it off.
Cut it according to what you find suitable, but be careful around the glans.  If some of the glans is cut, it will not cause harm.  Treat it with the cauterizing agents for wounds described in the chapter on cauterization.
If more skin is cut than necessary and it retracts further up, that also will not cause much harm. Treat it as mentioned previously until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
On treating urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to obstruction by a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or overgrown flesh, or similar causes.  If you treat it with the methods of treatment described in the classifications, it will be cured.
If the urine does not pass, and you suspect the obstruction is from a stone that has damaged the neck of the bladder, the patient should be placed on their knees, then a person should sit on their back, extending their stomach towards the back of the sitter, and the patient should hold themselves as tightly as possible.
This will cause the bladder neck to push the stone backward, allowing the urine to pass.  If the urine does not pass by this method, and the patient's condition worsens, extraction with an instrument called a catheter, of which this is an image, should be employed.
It is made of silver, thin and smooth, hollow like a bird's feather tube, about a foot and a half long, with a gentle funnel at its tip.  The method for drawing the urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie strong yarn or cotton to one end.
You insert the thread end into the catheter's tip and trim any excess yarn with nippers so that it fits snugly within the tube, like a button. Then, the catheter is lubricated with oil, butter, or egg white, and the patient sits on a chair.
The bladder and urethra are moistened with warm water and oil or other lubricating substances.  Then, the catheter is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra. The urethra is then pulled upwards towards the navel, and the catheter is pushed further inside.
Once the urethra has been pulled up, the catheter is pushed further inside until it nears the anus.  Then, the penis is lowered, the catheter remaining inside, and the catheter is pushed until it reaches the bladder, where the patient feels that it has reached an empty space.
This is done in this manner because the urinary tract has curves.  Then, the thread with the yarn is pulled gently; the urine follows the yarn.  Then, it is removed, and the urine is drained, and the catheter is returned.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Images of suitable instruments for this purpose are made of silver or hollowed ivory.  They have a long, thin tube, and are used to drop water and medicines into it.  This is done with an instrument called a syringe.  Here is its image:
Made of silver or hollowed ivory, it has a long, thin tube, hollow throughout except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
The hollow part, where the projectile is, should be as large as is necessary to contain it, without more.  Thus, if you pull something out, it will be pulled out, and if you push something in, it will be pushed to a distance, just as the oil-throwing device used in naval warfare does.
If you want to remove moisture from the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull upward on the projectile, causing the moisture to be drawn into the syringe's hollow.  Then, you insert the tip into the urethra, as described in our discussion of catheters, and push the moisture out with the projectile.
This moisture will reach the bladder accordingly, so that the patient will feel it.  Here is a picture of a gentle enema to irrigate the bladder also.
It is made of silver or a similar material.  The upper part resembles a small funnel, with a groove beneath where the ligature is placed.  Then, a camel's bladder is taken, and the moisture with which you want to irrigate the bladder is placed within it.  Then, it is securely tied between the two grooves with a double thread.
Warm the moisture slightly over a fire. Then insert the tip of the irrigator into the urethra, and firmly squeeze the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment, form a circle with it, and pierce it along its entire circumference. Then thread a strong cord through those holes, as it circles.  Gather the circle as a table is gathered, after placing within it whatever moisture, ointments, or water you desire.
Then tie it to the instrument and use it in the same manner as with the bladder, squeezing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On removing stones.
We have previously described the types of stones, their treatment with medications, and the differences between kidney stones and bladder stones, along with their respective signs.  We have also discussed stones requiring manual removal and incision.
This is specifically the stone originating in the bladder, and the one that develops in the urethra.  I will describe this clearly and concisely.
I say that bladder stones are most often found in children, and a sign of them is that the urine expelled from the bladder is thin, like water.
Sand appears, and he rubs and plays with his penis.  It often hangs down, and the anus often protrudes in many of them.  Children usually recover from it before reaching fourteen years of age.  It is difficult in the elderly, and in young adults, it is intermediate between the two.
Those with larger stones have easier treatment, and the opposite is true for smaller ones.  When it comes to treatment, it is first necessary to irrigate the patient with an enema to remove all the impurities in his intestines, as this can prevent the stone from being detected during examination.
Then, the patient is taken by the legs and shaken downwards to cause the stone to descend to the neck of the bladder, or he is made to jump from a high place several times.  Then, he is seated upright before you, with his hands under his thighs, so that the entire bladder tilts downwards, and then he is examined.
And feel it from the outside. If you feel the stone in the space, immediately make an incision into it. If it is not at all under your touch, then it is necessary to smear the index finger with grease from the left hand, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger.
If the boy is fully grown, you insert it into his anus and search for the stone.  Once it is under your finger, move it little by little towards the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it outwards toward the place you intend to make an incision.
You order a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and another servant to extend his right hand upwards towards the genitals and with his other hand to pull the skin below the genitals towards the incision site.  Then take the incision probe which has this shape:
Make the incision between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but on the side of the left thigh.  The incision should be directly over the stone. Your finger should be in the anus, pressing the stone outwards, so that the incision is wide from the outside and narrow from the inside, as much as possible to allow the stone to come out.
Do not enlarge it too much.  Perhaps pressing the finger in the anus will cause the stone to come out easily during the incision.  Know that some stones have angles and edges, making their removal difficult.
Some are smooth, like acorns, and round, making removal easier.  If a stone has angles and edges, widen the incision slightly.  If it does not come out, you should use a device.  Either grasp it with a firm, file-like tool.
To hold the stone firmly so it does not slip, or insert a delicate curved instrument underneath it.  If that is not possible, widen the incision slightly.  If you encounter bleeding, stop it with a cauterizing agent.
If there are more than one stone, first remove the largest one to the bladder opening, then incise it, and then remove the smaller stones.  Do the same if there are more than two. If the stone is very large, it is foolish to make a large incision, as this could expose the patient to one of two outcomes.
Either he will die or he will have constant dribbling of urine, because the wound will not heal. But try to push it out, or devise a way to break it using forceps so that you can remove it in pieces.
After your work, treat the wound with kender, sabar, shiyan, and a bandage.  Place a dressing soaked in oil, liquid medicine, or rose oil and cold water on it to reduce inflammation.  Then the patient should lie on their back and do not loosen the bandage for three days.
Once the swelling subsides, wash the area with plenty of water and oil.  Then treat it with the palm ointment and basilica ointment until it heals.  If a severe inflammation, festering, or similar occurs in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder preventing urination, this is recognized by blood appearing in the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to the corruption and festering of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt. Treat each type with a corresponding remedy until healed.
During all treatment times, the thighs should be bound and brought together to secure the remedies applied to the area. If the stone is small and has lodged in the urethra, causing inflammation and preventing urination, treat it as I have described before it reaches a rupture.
Frequently, this treatment dispensed with incision.  I have tried this: take a probe made of hardened steel, shaped like this:
A triangular, pointed probe is inserted into a stick.  Then take a thread and tie the penis below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder.  Then carefully insert the probe into the urethra until it reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the probe gently against the stone, gradually trying to pierce it until it passes through from the other side.  Urine will flow immediately.  Then grasp the remaining stone outside the penis, and it will break apart and exit with the urine.  The patient will recover.
If this treatment is not possible due to an obstacle, tie a thread below the stone and another above it. Then, incise the stone on the penis between the ties, and remove it.
Then, loosen the ties and clean the coagulated blood from the wound.  The thread was tied below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other above to ensure that when the thread is loosened after the stone is removed, the skin will return to its place, covering the wound.
Therefore, when tying the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns and covers the wound, as we said.
Sixty-first Chapter.
In removing stones in women.
Stones rarely develop in women.  If one of them has a stone, its treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons, one being that the woman may be a virgin, and the second that you will not find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or of the family, and the third that you will not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially manual work, and the fourth that the location of the incision on the stone in women is far from the stone's location, requiring a deep incision.
And in that there is danger. If necessity demands it, a skilled female physician should be sought; however, one is rarely found. If one is not found, seek a virtuous, compassionate male physician or bring in a skilled female midwife or a woman knowledgeable in this craft to provide some guidance.
She is brought in and instructed to perform all examinations on the stone. First, she is to examine if the woman is a virgin.  If so, she should insert her finger into the vagina and probe for the stone. If she finds it, she should press it beneath her finger.
If she is not a virgin but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and applying firm pressure.
If she finds it, she should guide it from the mouth of the bladder downward as far as possible, until it reaches the root of the thigh. Then she should make the incision on the side of the vagina, near the root of the thigh, whichever side feels the stone in that area.
Her finger must remain on the stone, pressing it. The incision should be small at first. Then, the probe should be inserted into that small incision. If she feels the stone, she should widen the incision as much as she believes necessary to remove the stone. Know that there are many types of stones.
There are small and large stones, smooth and rough, long and round, and those with crevices. Recognize their types so you can determine what to do. If blood flows excessively, apply pulverized alum to the area, and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops. Then return to your work.
Until the stone is removed. Prepare the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men to assist in your work. If excessive bleeding occurs and you determine the bleeding is from a severed artery, apply a styptic to the area.
Tighten it with the dressings firmly and leave it. Do not repeat the procedure. Leave the stone; do not remove it.  The patient may die. Then treat the wound. When the intensity of the bleeding subsides after a few days, and the area becomes infected, return to your work until the stone is removed.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
On the puncture of watery blisters.
A watery blister is the accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum underneath the scrotum's skin surrounding the testicle, called the scrotum. It may also be in a special membrane prepared by nature on one side of the testicle.
It may appear as another testicle, occurring between the scrotal skin and the white peritoneum we mentioned.  This is rare.  These blisters result from weakness affecting women, to which this material is attracted.  They may also be caused by injury to women.
This moisture can take on various colors: yellow, blood-red, dark-brown, or whitish-watery, the latter being the most common.  These are the signs by which it is recognized.
Where the water accumulates, if it's in the white peritoneum we mentioned, the swelling will be somewhat elongated and round, like an egg, and the testicle will not be visible because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a special membrane of its own, the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle.
For this reason, one might think it is another testicle. If the moisture is between the scrotal skin and the white peritoneum, it is palpable. To determine the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe previously described.  Judge its interior by the substance that emerges after probing.
If we move on to treatment with leeches, the patient should be bled, if possible, and if you see their body is full, then they should lie on their back on a slightly elevated surface, with many cloths beneath them, and you should sit to their left.
Instruct a servant to sit on the patient's right, extending the patient's penis toward one side of the scrotal skin, and towards the abdominal wall.  Then, take a wide scalpel and make a longitudinal incision through the scrotal skin from the center, towards the pubic area.
The incision should be made in a straight line parallel to the line dividing the scrotal skin in half, until you reach the white peritoneum.  Separate it carefully, taking care not to cut it. Make your separation from the side that is closest to the testicle, and continue the separation as much as possible.
Then, dissect the water-filled peritoneum widely and remove all the water.  Then, separate the edges of the incision with forceps, lift the peritoneum upward, avoiding the scrotal skin below, and cut the peritoneum as much as possible, either in one piece or in sections.
Especially its thin side; if you do not completely cut it, you cannot be certain that the water will not return.  If the testicle protrudes from its skin during the procedure, then replace it, and stitch the edges of the scrotal skin together.
Then treat it as you would any other surgical wound until healed.  If the testicle has been damaged by another ailment, it is necessary to tie the vessels in the sac to prevent bleeding, then separate the testicle from the sac, remove the testicle, and then treat it as we described.
If the accumulated water is in both areas, know that it is a hydrocele.  Incise the other side in the same manner as you did the first, and if you prefer to do the procedure only once, do so. Then wipe away the blood.
Insert wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions. Place another layer of wool soaked in a mixture of water and oil over the testicles and the abdominal region.  Then place folded linen cloths (bandages) on top. Tie it from above with the six-sided bandage in this manner:
Then take two cloths, stitch them together, and fill them with fluffy wool in this manner.  Make the straps for binding from wet cotton or wool and secure them tightly with a belt around the waist.  One strap should be positioned from the buttocks to the back.
The second strap should extend towards the pubic area and the other two straps should be placed on the thighs, below. The remaining two straps should be placed on the groin.  All straps should be tied together with a waist belt.  This hydrocele can also be treated by cauterization instead of incision with a metal instrument.
This involves using a gentle, heated scalpel to cut the scrotal skin, exposing the white membrane containing the water. Then, use another heated cauterizing instrument in this manner:
It resembles a Greek eye; then, cauterize the membrane with it while it is hot until all the moisture is expelled.  Then, pull the membrane with forceps and use the cautery to strip away the surrounding layer, cutting it as much as possible to remove all of it, taking care not to burn the testicle.
Know that this method is safer and less prone to bleeding than the incision method.  If, during the incision or cauterization process, you encounter a hot swelling, bleeding, or any other complication, then you should treat each problem with the appropriate remedy, as previously described.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot tolerate this procedure because of its unpleasantness, then use the cautery method as described, if it proves appropriate based on the previous evidence.
If the discharge is watery, the patient should sit on a raised chair. Then, cauterize the swelling below with a wide scalpel, and ensure the cauterization extends along the body, maintaining a wide opening so that all the water drains out. Then, place cotton on the area and bandage it.
Leave it to drain any remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not drain during the cauterization process, it is likely due to the white membrane obstructing the wound opening, preventing the water from exiting.
In that case, you should insert a goose quill, or the instrument used to extract the water from the afflicted, previously described, or slightly enlarge the wound opening.
Know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so. If it does accumulate, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient should rest during the days.
Sixty-third chapter.
Concerning the rupture of fleshy tissues and their treatment.
Know that rupture of these fleshy tissues is often a perilous condition leading to death.  Therefore, we recommend leaving it alone and avoiding treatment, though I will describe the procedure and types of swelling.
I say that many swellings occur in the bodies that compose the flesh, from numerous causes.  Either from excessive heat concentrated in the flesh, or from a blow.  The swelling's color matches the body's color, and contains no water.
The swelling is firm and may be hardened, its color like mud, and without sensation. It may be due to the constriction and swelling of blood vessels, as previously mentioned, or to the swelling of veins.  If it is due to the swelling of arteries, the swelling will dissipate.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be operated on at all.  However, if it is due to swelling of the veins, nothing will dissipate when pressed with the fingers. This type can be ruptured, and in conjunction with the surrounding flesh.
This involves cutting the scrotum, then pulling the testicle upwards, removing it from the white peritoneum, freeing the suspension from the vessels, tying off the vessels, and cutting off the suspension after freeing it from all sides of the testicle. If the testicle has adhered to the growing flesh.
Then the testicle must be extracted and cut. If the adhesion is between any of the membranes or vessels, then all such adhesion must be freed and cut in a circular fashion.
If the flesh is growing at the point of adhesion, which is behind, then all of it must be cut, and the testicle removed as we said.  Once your procedure is complete, treat the large wound with moist wool in rose-oil and a potion, then treat it with further remedies until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
On treating the dropsy associated with the dropsy (or, a specific type of dropsy).
Dropsy is a swollen, twisted tumor, resembling a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the limbs. It hinders the afflicted person from movement, exercise, and walking. The treatment for this affliction is similar to what was mentioned before.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as the ancients did. I say that the patient should sit on a raised chair, then the lower limbs should be pushed downwards, and the scrotum's skin should be held with your fingers, along with the vessels close to the penis.
A servant of yours should hold it and pull it forcefully, then make a slanted cut with a wide, sharp scalpel, close to the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.  Then, strip them from every side, as I have described to you in the dissection of the arteries in the temples. Then, insert a needle with a double thread into them.
Tie it at the initial points where the dropsy appeared and also at the end, then cut it in the middle with a vertical incision along the body and remove the accumulated turbid and corrupted fluids.
Then, treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds that take time to heal, so that the vessels that nourish one of the limbs fall off. There is no harm in that. If the dropsy affects all the vessels, one limb must be removed with the vessels, lest the egg be deprived of nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, it will wither and be of no use.
Chapter Sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal dropsy.
This dropsy occurs when a rupture appears in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen, near the groin area, causing the intestines to protrude into one of the limbs.
This rupture is either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its extension.  These two types arise from many causes, such as a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting a heavy object, and the like.  If it is from an extension of the peritoneum, it occurs gradually over a long period of time.
It does not occur suddenly.  If from the peritoneum's extension, the swelling is gradual, reaching considerable depth because the peritoneum compresses the intestines.  If from a tear in the peritoneum, it initially causes severe pain abruptly, and the swelling is readily apparent under the skin nearby.
The intestines may protrude outside the peritoneum, and with them, fluid may escape, thus making this dropsy intestinal and fluid-filled.  There may also be wind, or the intestines may collect waste material, which will then be trapped, causing the patient's death.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially if compressed.  Treatment of these types of illness with iron is dangerous; one should therefore avoid it.  The procedure is to instruct the patient to push the intestines back inside their body cavity if they can be returned.
Then, the patient lies on their back with you in front, and their legs are raised.  Then, the skin around the groin is pulled upward, and the entire skin of the testicles is cut lengthwise.  Hooks are inserted into the edges of the cut, to the extent necessary to open the wound.
The incision should be large enough to allow the testicle to emerge.  Then, the peritoneum under the skin of the testicles is peeled back until the white, tough peritoneum is exposed on all sides.  At that point, insert your index finger into the area below the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum beneath the testicle's skin and the second peritoneum, release the adhesions behind the testicle.  Then, with your right hand, pull inwards on the testicle's skin, while with your left hand you pull the white peritoneum upward and lift the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision.
You instruct the attendant to pull the testicle upward, and you completely release the adhesions behind it.  You use your finger to check for any twisted intestines within the tough white peritoneum; if you find any, push them back into the abdomen below.
Then, take a needle with a thick thread, twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin near the incision.  Then, cut the ends of the thread, so that there are four threads. Then, intertwine some of the threads together in a firm knot and tie the peritoneum, which we said is beneath the scrotal skin, tightly on both sides.  Then, also tie off the ends of the threads tightly, so that nothing of the vessels nourishing it can reach it. To prevent a hot tumor from developing, and make a second ligature outside the first ligature, a distance of less than two fingers.  After these two ligatures, leave a portion of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a finger.
To prevent a hot tumor from developing, and make a second ligature outside the first ligature, a distance of less than two fingers.  After these two ligatures, leave a portion of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a finger. Cut the rest of it in a circle, and remove the testicle along with it.  Then make an incision below the scrotal skin that bleeds and discharges, as described previously. Then use wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound, and use the ligature that we have described.
The white peritoneum, which we said to cut carefully to prevent bleeding, often results in this.  Leave the ligature until it falls off on its own. If it is slow to fall, then soak it in hot water and apply something that will make it sweat, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for surgical wounds until it heals.
Sixty-sixth Chapter.
In this case of wind-related swellings, I have seen no one dare to treat it with iron.  The ancients mentioned making it as we described in the swelling with a cyst, by gently tying the vessels below the incision.
Then it is incised in the middle, and the swelling is treated to open it until the vessels fall out, and the wound is treated as we described until it heals.
Sixty-seventh Chapter.
In the hernia that occurs in the groin.
The hernia in the groin may occur, as we said, and nothing from the intestines descends into the female organs.  If it does descend, it is slight and always returns.
But if time passes, the tear in the peritoneum increases, until the intestines and testicles descend into the scrotum.  This arises from the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we said. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and protrudes the place, bulging.  Its treatment is by cauterization, as I previously described.
And it may be treated with iron in this manner: the patient lies on his back before you, then you make a transverse incision in the swollen, protruding hernial area about three finger-widths wide, and then cauterize the peritoneum under the skin.
Until the white peritoneum beneath is exposed, then you take a reed, place it on the protruding area of the peritoneum, and press it into the depth of the abdomen. Then you sew the two protruding places on the reed end of the peritoneum, and attach them together with stitching.
Then remove the reed.  Do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I instructed you in treating intestinal hernia. Then treat it with the treatment for surgical cases.
If the stitches break, clean them and close the wound until it heals, as the peritoneum will contract and the hernia will not increase.
And this is the best approach in this situation, as it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the scrotum's skin.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without the underlying tissues relaxing, making its appearance unsightly.  Therefore, anyone wishing to treat this should lay the patient on their back.
He should cut all the relaxed skin away from the thick skin, and then bring the edges together. If you prefer, first stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, securing them, and then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other surgical wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Sixty-ninth Chapter.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, I should not mention it in this book.  However, I have mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that a physician will be knowledgeable about it if asked, and will know how to treat those who have been affected, and the other, that we often need to castrate animals for our benefit.
Like sheep, oxen, and cats, and similar animals.  I say that castration is of two types, either by crushing or by incision and cutting.  The method of crushing is that we sit the animal in warm water until its testicles relax and soften and hang down.
Then you crush them with your hand until they are broken and no longer discernible to the touch.  As for castration by incision and cutting, you must hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligaments and make a single incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles protrude, then cut them after removing the coverings, leaving only the thin membrane covering the vessels. This method of castration is better than crushing.
Because crushing may leave some of the testicles behind, so the animal may desire mating.  Then the wound is treated until healed.
Chapter Seventy.
In the treatment of hermaphrodites.
The hermaphrodite in men comes in two types. One appears as a space or a fold in the scrotum resembling a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from the fold in the scrotum.
In women, there is one type. It is above the vulva, on the pubic area, like small, erect, prominent testicles. One of them resembles a man's penis, and the two together resemble the vulva.  Treatment for these three types.
The two types of men and the single type of women require the removal of the excess flesh, so that its effect is resolved and then treated with the treatment for other wounds until healed.  As for the second type of man from whom urine flows from the scrotum, there is no action or cure for it at all.
Chapter seventy-one.
On the cutting of the foreskin and the fleshy growth from the vulva of women.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond the natural state, becoming discolored and unsightly.  In some women, it may even enlarge to the point of resembling that of men, leading to the possibility of sexual intercourse.
Therefore, one should grasp the excess clitoris with one's hand or forceps and cut it off, but do not cut too deeply, especially into the root, to prevent bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical remedies until it heals.  As for the fleshy growth, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb, filling it.
And perhaps it extends outwards, like a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients called it the 'tail-like disease'. It should be cut, like the clitoris, and treated until it heals.
The Seventy-Second Chapter.
On the treatment of ruptures.
A rupture is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the perforation is small, and it may be either natural, born with it, or accidental.  The accidental rupture is from a prior cause, and it may arise from excess overgrown flesh.
or from thin or thick peritoneum, and may be located deep within the uterus, or on its sides, or at its top or bottom.  It prevents intercourse, procreation, childbirth, and possibly menstruation.  Knowledge of this is acquired through observation by the midwife.
If the obstruction is visible and nearby, but if not visible, she should examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is from thin peritoneum and is close to the labia, then proceed to puncture it.  To do this, form a sort of fold on the labia, and then place both index fingers on it.
And the woman should be lying on her back with her legs spread, then forcefully spread the labia until the thin peritoneum is punctured and the obstruction opens.  Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area.  The woman should be cohabited with every day, so that the area does not adhere again.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, it should be incised with a broad scalpel resembling a leaf of a date palm. If the obstruction is from overgrown flesh, then suspend it with forceps and cut it.  Have with you medicines to stop bleeding without cauterization, such as acacia, sheean, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then a wide lead tube should be used to prevent the wound from closing quickly.  Hold it for a few days, and use a wick of dry linen, then treat with the rest of the treatment for an abscess until healed.  Another growth of flesh may appear in the uterus, and it should be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor.  A cancerous tumor which is in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red boils that appear on the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the veins' openings, causing a constant flow of copious blood.  If hemorrhoids progress, they become warts.  Their types and signs have been mentioned in the classification, and we describe them here.
What is curable and what is not.  I say that if the hemorrhoids and warts are deep within the uterus and do not appear to the touch, then there is no treatment with iron.  Those which are on the mouth of the uterus, where they can be felt, are those that can be treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, then the warts should be scraped with a lancet or a rough cloth and cut off at their roots.  Then, if blood flows from one of the blood-cutting instruments, it should be stopped without causing a puncture.
Such as henna, shian, and frankincense, etc. Then, elevate her legs against the wall for an hour, then lower them into cool water. If the bleeding persists, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, and astringent herbs, etc. Then, take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
Apply this to her back. If the bleeding stops, then stop. Otherwise, apply leeches to the lower back and breasts, without restrictions.  Then take wool, dip it in the juice of rue, or the juice of comfrey, or the juice of the branches of privet, with astringent drink, and apply it to the area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until healed. As for the red sore, it resembles the heads of boils, rough in appearance. It should be cut off as much as has appeared, just as with the warts, and treated until healed.
The Seventy-fourth Chapter.
On treating abscesses in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may appear in the uterus, such as cancer, stony tumors, ulcers, wasting diseases, devouring diseases, polyps, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors.  All of these diseases and their types and signs have been described in the classification.
Therefore, in this article, we must discuss the hot tumor that appears in the uterus, if it is one of the tumors that have accumulated for a duration. How is it treated with iron?  Observe if, in its initial stages, the tumor's pain is severe, with throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
And if you see it red, if touched, do not rush to treat it. Treat it with what aids maturation, until these symptoms subside.  Then, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean back.
And draw her legs toward the lower abdomen, spreading her thighs, and placing her arms under her knees, securing them with an appropriate bandage.
Then, the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument to open the cervix, the image of which will be presented later.  If you wish to use this instrument, you must estimate the depth of the woman's uterus, so that what enters from the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
If the instrument is deeper than the depth, this will harm the patient.  Therefore, applicators should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the instrument from entering the depth of the uterus entirely. The spiral that runs in the instrument must be on the upper side.
While you hold the instrument, the attendant rotates the spiral until the cervix opens.  If a boil appears and is soft and thin when touched by hand, it should be incised at its head with a broad scalpel. When all the matter has been discharged.
A soft wick dipped in rose oil or green oil with some astringent should be placed in the wound. The wick should extend outside the incision in the cervix.  Outside, on the uterus and pubis, place pure wool dipped in boiled baker's water.
Then, treat it after two days with the ointment suitable for it until it heals.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting water and honey, then water boiled with soss or long zarawand root.  Then return to the ointment.  If the boil is hidden inside the uterus.
Iron should be avoided in its treatment; it should be treated as described in the classification.
Chapter seventy-five.
On teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural form.
The midwife must first know the natural form of childbirth.  Signs include the woman drawing downwards, longing to smell the air, and finding the postpartum state easier to bear.
A rapid delivery indicates a natural birth, with the baby emerging headfirst, and the placenta either coming out with it or hanging from the navel.  If you see these signs, you should press her abdomen to hasten the delivery of the baby.
If it emerges headfirst, the placenta comes out with it, and it is cleaned well of those impurities.  Any birth other than this is unnatural and undesirable, as the baby might be born feet first or with arms and legs emerging before the head.
A single arm or leg, or the head and an arm, or a twisted position, or perhaps the baby emerging on its back—these are all undesirable forms.  The midwife should be skillful, gentle, with all these things, and careful to avoid mistakes.
I am explaining each form and how to address each.  If the baby emerges headfirst, the natural way, and the woman's labor is strong and difficult, and you see her strength weakening, have her sit on a chair and instruct other women to support her.
Bind her uterus with boiled licorice and moist ointments.  Then the midwife should insert a small scalpel between her fingers, and cut the placenta, or cut it with her fingernail, to drain its moisture.  Then press the woman's abdomen until the baby is expelled.
If it does not descend, the woman should be injected with licorice saliva mixed with shirg's fat.  After the injection, tell her to cough, and use a reed to make her sneeze. Hold her mouth and nose.  The baby will come out soon. If the baby's arms emerge first, gently push them back slowly.
If the baby fails to descend, place the woman on a stool, raising her legs.  Then shake the stool on the ground, while the woman grips to prevent falling.  If the hands do not enter and the baby is dead, cut them off and pull out the rest of the baby.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them out gently; he will come out.  If the baby emerges on its feet, push its feet upward, then turn the baby a little at a time until it is straight, and then pull one leg slightly.
If they emerge to the thighs, tell her to cough and make her sneeze with a reed.  It will come out.  If it does not come out by these methods, gently rotate the baby back into its natural position, and it will then come out smoothly. If it still refuses to come out by all these methods...
Take saliva of the *khatmi* plant, licorice saliva, and *shirg* fat, and dissolved gum.  Pound all of them well in a mortar.  Then, apply this mixture to the woman's vagina and lower abdomen.  Then, make her sit in lukewarm water until it reaches the thighs.
If you see that the lower part has softened, make her a compress of myrrh and have her endure it. If she holds it for an hour, have her sit on a chair, then make her sneeze, and block her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen.  The baby will come out immediately.  The baby emerges on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, gently insert the hands a little at a time.  Then, the woman lies on her back, with her buttocks hanging down while lying on a bed and pressing her hands together.  Then gently press above her abdomen. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her feet are elevated. If the baby does not emerge, take both her legs and move them vigorously.  Then press above the thighs gently until the baby moves upwards, then the midwife inserts her hand and gently positions the baby.
Tell the woman to strain until the baby emerges. The baby emerges sideways, with one arm hanging down.  Gently reposition the arm. If you can't reposition it, have the woman stand up and walk. If she can't walk, have her lie down.
Shake her legs vigorously, then use the poultice described from saliva. If the delivery is obstructed, have her sit on a chair, then work on repositioning the arm and putting the baby in the natural position. Make the woman sneeze and tell her to strain until it emerges.
The baby emerges on its back, arms outstretched, and its face towards the mother's back. The midwife should grasp the baby's hand and gently turn and straighten it.  Once straightened, apply the fat and saliva we have described to the baby's forehead.
Then tell her to move gently. Once she does this, have her sit on a chair and tell her to lean to her right side. Then tell her to strain and make her sneeze with the forceps.  The baby will emerge, upright on its side.
If it descends into the cervix in this manner with the placenta, cut the placenta with your fingernail until it is free of moisture.  If it is attached to the baby's face or neck, cut it from the umbilical cord to prevent suffocation and death. Then push the baby inside until it is in the correct position.
Tell the woman to strain repeatedly, and it will emerge easily.  For the birth of twins or multiple fetuses, know that twins frequently are born, and sometimes three or four are born and survive; however, this is rare.  As for five, this is unnatural and they will never survive.
And they are surrounded by a single placenta, however numerous, and they are separated by a membranous partition attached to the umbilical cord of each.  They may emerge like a single baby, naturally and easily, or emerge in a difficult manner, as described.
If some of them are difficult to deliver and present the unnatural forms we have mentioned, treat them as we have described.  Let the midwife be gentle and do everything with care and patience, and use any means available to achieve safety.
It is possible for one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten fetuses to form in the womb, and it has been verified that one woman miscarried seven and another fifteen, all of them conceived.
By the estimation of the Exalted and Knowing, all of this should be known to the midwife, for she may encounter such a case sometime and should know how to deal with it appropriately.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
In the delivery of a dead fetus.
If, having treated the dead fetus with the methods of treatment described in the section, it does not emerge and you are forced to intervene manually, then you should consider the woman's condition.  If she is healthy and has no symptoms that cause concern for her well-being, the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
Her head should be tilted downward and her legs raised, and an attendant should hold her securely from both sides, or bind her to the bed, so that her body does not shift when the fetus is drawn out.
Then, the mouth of her uterus is moistened with the moist ointments, along with the saliva of the [specified] herb, fenugreek, and linseed. Then, the midwife anoints her hand with these ointments and salivas, and gently inserts it into the uterus. She then seeks a place to insert the hooks, targeting the appropriate locations on the fetus.
If the fetus is positioned to descend head-first, insert the hooks into its eyes, or the back of its head, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or collarbone, or the areas near the ribs, or beneath the clavicles.
And if its descent is on its feet, then at the pubic region and the middle ribs.  The hook should be held in the right hand, its curve placed between the fingers of the left hand.  The hand should be inserted gently and a hook driven into one of the aforementioned locations.
Until it reaches an empty space, then another or a third hook is inserted opposite it, if needed, to ensure an equal pull without it tilting to one side.  The pulling should be even and not just in a straight line, but also moving in all directions.
To facilitate its removal, as is done with a tooth when extracting it.  During this process, the pulling should be relaxed if it gets stuck in one place. The midwife should then anoint some of her fingers with ointment and insert them to rotate any part that's stuck.  If part of the fetus emerges, the hooks should be moved to other locations.
She should do this a little higher until the whole fetus is removed. If a hand emerges before the rest and cannot be pushed back due to its being compressed, it should be wrapped in a cloth and pulled out until the whole hand is extracted and then severed.
Either at the wrist joint or the elbow.  This should also be done for the other hand and the legs. If the fetal head is large and experiences pressure during delivery or has accumulated water in its head, a pointed, slender instrument should be inserted between the fingers.
Using it, the head is opened to release the water, or it is compressed with the instrument called a *mashdakh*, whose image is shown with the images of other instruments in the following chapter.
Likewise, if the fetus has an unusually large head, the skull should be cut open or compressed with the *mashdakh*, as mentioned before.  Then the bones should be removed with forceps. If the head emerges and gets stuck at the collarbone, it should be cut open to allow the moisture in the chest to drain.
Then the chest will close.  If the chest does not close and cannot be extracted, cut as much as possible. If the lower abdomen or belly is swollen or contains tumors, it should be punctured to allow the moisture to drain.
If the fetus is positioned on its feet, pulling it out and guiding it toward the cervix is easy. If it is stuck at the abdomen or chest, it should be pulled with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be cut open to allow the contents to drain.
If all other organs are removed and the head returns and is stuck, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the cervix is open, she should insert her hand into the cervix, grasp the head, pull it with her fingers toward the cervix, then insert a hook or two and pull it out with them.
If the cervix has adhered to a hot, inflamed tumor, one should not force it. Instead, apply moist, oily substances, use bandages, and sit in relaxing, moist water.
If the fetus is on its side, if possible, use the methods described for a living fetus.  If not possible, cut and remove it.  Absolutely no part of the placenta should be left inside. Once you are finished with the treatment, use the treatments mentioned for hot tumors that arise in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, she should sit in constricting water and use other treatments.  I have witnessed a woman who became pregnant, then the fetus died inside her, and subsequently she became pregnant again.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a tumor appeared in her groin, swelling until it opened and discharged pus.  I was called to treat her, and treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close.  I then applied some potent, drawing ointments to it.
A bone then emerged from the area, and after some days, another bone came out. I was amazed by this, as the abdomen is not a place where bone is found.  I concluded that they were bones from the dead fetus. I searched the wound and removed many bones from the fetus's skull.
I continued this process until I removed many bones. The woman was in the best of health and lived like that for a long time, with a slight discharge of pus from the area. I have presented this unusual case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts to achieve with his hands in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
It contains images of the instruments needed for removing the fetus.
Image of a spiral used to dilate the cervix.
This is the binder, with which books are bound together. It has two spirals at the ends of the wooden planks, but this spiral should be gentler than the binder and should be either ebony or boxwood.  The width of each plank should be two finger-widths.
Their edges should be about a finger's width, and their length should be one and a half spans. In the middle of the planks, there are two rods of the same wood, firmly attached to them. Their length should be half a span, or slightly more, and their width about two fingers' width, or slightly more. These two rods.
They are the ones that enter the cervix to dilate it when turning the spirals; an image of another, similar instrument, gentler and lighter.
Made of ebony or boxwood, shaped like tongs, but with two rods at the end, as you see. Each rod is about a span long and two fingers wide.  If you want to dilate the cervix with it...
Then have the woman lie on a bed, legs spread apart, and insert these two rods, tightly, into the cervix.  You hold the end of the instrument between her legs, and then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with tongs, to whatever degree you want to dilate the cervix. So that the midwife can do as desired.  An image of another spiral, mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument used to expel the fetus.
Image of the instrument used to crush the fetal head.
It resembles scissors, having teeth at the end, as you see.  It can be made oblong like tongs, in this form, as you see; it has teeth like a saw's teeth, with which to cut and deliver.
Image of a delivery instrument as well.
Image of a hook.
This hook should have some thickness so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it. Image of a double-pronged hook.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these tools, the more types there are and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work and the higher the esteem of them among people.  Do not despise any tool to be prepared, as there is always a need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In the removal of the placenta.
If the placenta remains after childbirth, it is necessary to instruct the woman to hold herself still, then make her sneeze with a [wooden] implement, and grip your hand firmly on her mouth and nostrils.  If it comes out this way, well and good. Otherwise, take a measure.
Pierce a hole in the cover, place in it herbs that open the cervix, such as rue, mint, dill, chamomile, wormwood, sage, and valerian – all of these medicines, or some of them;  immerse them in water and place over a fire.  Then place a silver tube on the hole of the pot’s cover, and the other end in the woman’s cervix.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then have her sneeze, as we said.  If the placenta comes out quickly, well and good.  If it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, order the midwife to dip her left hand in the fat of a she-camel or the saliva of the sea-hawk.
Then she inserts it into the vagina and searches for the placenta. If she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out slowly, little by little. If it is stuck deep within the uterus, insert the hand as we described until, if the placenta is found, pulling it out slowly, little by little, gently.
So that the uterus does not fall during strong pulling, but it is necessary to gently move it to the sides, right and left, and then increase the amount of pulling. Then it will respond and be freed from the adhesion.  If the cervix is closed, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, beware of force when re-pulling, but it is necessary to tie what has come out of it to the woman's thigh, then inject her with the four-part ointment.  For it will putrefy her after some days.
It will dissolve and come out, but if it putrefies, a foul odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, and that will harm the patient. Therefore, a suitable decoction must be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients have tried the decoction of the incense and dried figs, as a picture of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated when menses and placenta are retained, and the like.
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or made of copper.  The narrow end is placed at the vulva, and the wide end over the fire.  The incense is placed on the embers; it is held until the incense is gone and then replaced with more.
Chapter Seventy-nine.
In the treatment of the unperforated anus.
Many boys are born with unperforated anuses, which may be blocked by a thin membrane.  The midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger, or else cut it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, and treat with ointments until healed.  If you fear it will close again, insert a lead tube into the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
The anus may also be blocked by an abscess or a tumor.  In this case, the abscess should be incised, and then treated with the remedies mentioned, and with cauterization.
Chapter Eighty.
On treating warts that appear on the lower parts of the body.
Warts that occur on the lower parts are a complication and thickening that happens near the anus, either externally or in the space on one side.  There may be one or more warts.
If this thickening persists, it may open and discharge a whitish watery fluid or thin pus.  Some of these warts may penetrate into the rectum and intestines.  If they are non-penetrating, they may be identified by what is expelled from them in the stool and wind when using the laxative.
Possibly worms may also be expelled from them.  Some warts, if located in the space and penetrating into the bladder or urethra, may be found. Some may penetrate into the hip joint or tailbone.  The penetrating wart towards the anus can be recognized, as well as those that do not penetrate.
Insert your index finger into the anus and introduce a thin probe of copper or iron into the wart. If there is no deviation within the wart, then if there is a deviation, insert a thin lead probe, or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair on your finger. If you don't feel it at all, and nothing like stool, wind, or worms, as we mentioned, comes out of the opening, know that it is not penetrating, so proceed with treatment.
If the wart penetrates the bladder or urethra, the sign is the discharge of urine from it, and the inability of the affected area to heal with medications.  If it penetrates the hip joint or tailbone, the sign is the probe reaching there.
If there is no deviation to the bone, and pain is present in the affected area, and pus constantly issues from it, and if the treatment is ineffective and does not heal with ointment, then all these penetrating warts will never heal.
Treatment for these is a futile effort for those ignorant physicians who attempt it.  For those not penetrating and not chronic, healing is hoped for through the application of iron, as I describe and have tested.  This involves placing the patient on their back before you.
Raise his legs upward and his thighs angled toward his abdomen. Then, insert a copper or lead probe into the wart, if it deviates, so you will know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the buttocks, you should insert your index finger into the buttocks.
If you feel the probe has penetrated through your finger, exposed and without feeling any tissue or flesh between your finger and the probe, then be certain it is penetrating. Do not waste effort on it, for it will not heal, as we have said.
They say it heals in some rare cases.  A treatment that may be effective is to heat a thin cauterizing iron, according to the size of the wart, as previously mentioned.  Insert it hot into the wart until it reaches the area near the buttocks, then repeat this two or three times.
So that you know that all excess, solidified flesh, resembling a bird's feather tube, has been burned. Then treat it with a thread soaked in oil until the burned flesh comes out, and then treat it with healing ointments if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with other treatments.  If you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger in the buttock, and there is a thick layer of flesh or membrane between the probe and the finger, and you see the wart just below the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the wart. While making the incision, keep the probe within the wart, until the incision reaches where the probe tip ends. Remove and discard the probe. Then, clean away the solidified flesh, which resembles a bird's feather tube, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If bleeding overwhelms you and prevents you from completing the excision of that flesh, the best and quickest remedy is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine.  Cauterization by fire combines two beneficial effects: burning the excess flesh.
Stop the bleeding and dry the moisture. Then treat it with a thread soaked in oil or pulverized sulfur mixed with oil, until the area becomes suppurative and the burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that promote the growth of solid flesh.
These are the medicines that contract and dry. If it is cured, it is healed, and there is no need to return. If the wart extends deep into the buttock and away from the body surface, insert your finger into the buttock and search with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh, and it is close to piercing through, then the only action is one of hope and expectancy.  This is done by employing one of three methods: either cauterizing it, as we have said.
Or, cut it open until you reach its bottom, so you can apply the thread and treatment from close proximity.  Do not extend the cut too far, lest you sever the muscle surrounding the buttock, causing involuntary bowel movement.  Then, treat it as previously described.  Perhaps it will be healed, as we said.
Or, pierce that barrier and puncture it, after cutting it to the vicinity of the buttock, as we said, either with a probe or another sharply pointed instrument.  Then cleanse all the accumulated flesh in the cut to the extent possible.
Then, close the entire wound, including the cut and the upper opening, until it is sealed, leaving the wart open within the buttock. This will be less burdensome for the patient.  The wart may be healed in this manner.
If, when inserting the probe into the wart and it is on one side of the buttock, near the surface of the body, along with the skin and the circumference of the buttock, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a cobbler's awl, in this manner:.
Thread five or more strands of yarn through it. Then, insert the probe with the thread into the wart until you reach its bottom.  If it is protruding within the buttock margin from the inside, near it.
Pull the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the buttock and bringing out the end of the thread. Join both ends and tie them tightly. Leave it for a day or two, tightening the thread firmly whenever it cuts into the flesh, until the flesh between the ends of the threads breaks and falls out.  Then treat the wound until it heals and is completely recovered.
If the opening of the wart is not protruding, make it protrude as best you can, but not if it is deep within, for you should not do this to the muscle for fear of cutting it. Then, do to it as we mentioned above until it heals.
The shape of the pointed lancet used to pierce warts should have a very sharp curve on one side and the other side should not be sharp so as not to cut anything unnecessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-one.
Concerning hemorrhoids that bleed, their incision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are within the anus, resembling red swellings or like grapes, and come in small and large sizes, and blood constantly flows from them.
They can be single or multiple, and some are found outside the anus, at its edges. However, those located outside the anus are often less moist; a yellowish liquid or a little blood drips from them constantly, and they are the color of the body.
The treatment for those inside the anus is to instruct the patient to defecate and strain until the anus protrudes and the polyps are visible.  Then quickly grasp and remove them with forceps, or with your fingernail, cutting them at their base, if the forceps do not adhere due to their moisture and laxity.
Then grip it with a rough cloth or a piece of sharpened linen or pull it out with your fingers, then cut it, and afterward sprinkle some sharp powders over the cut to act as a cauterization, or cauterize it as previously described in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If the anus does not protrude, inject the patient with an enema containing a little sting to wash out what is inside the anus and cause it to quickly protrude when the patient strains.  As for polyps outside the anus, their treatment is easy and straightforward.
To remove it, grasp it with your fingernail or forceps, and cut it.  Then treat it with the methods mentioned until it heals.  For those who dislike cutting with metal, it is better to use a needle. Take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the polyp upward and pierce it with the needle at its base from the opposite side. Tie the ends of the thread below the needle, which is positioned across, and pull the polyp firmly. Then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the polyps, leaving one unpierced.
To allow the excess blood to drain, place a cloth soaked in rose oil or myrrh on the anus.  Have the patient rest, and leave it until the polyps fall off.  If the polyps fall off, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they heal.
As for treating fissures, they often arise from dryness, and a blockage of natural processes. If they are chronic and no medicine works, it is necessary to scrape them with a scalpel or your fingernail until they become moist and the upper crust, which prevents them from healing, is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more forcefully than before until it bleeds and peels. Then treat it, and it will heal.
Eighty-second Chapter.
On the treatment of ingrown nails, both ingrown and not ingrown, dry warts, and the ant (a type of skin lesion).
A nail is a rounded, skin-colored swelling resembling a nail head, occurring throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and toes, and causing pain when walking.
It is necessary to cut around the nail, then grasp it with a scalpel or a hook and pull it out from its root.  Then treat it. Or, if desired, cauterize it as previously described in the relevant chapter.  As for dry warts, each is a small, rough, hardened, rounded protuberance on the surface of the body.
They often appear on the hands of children.  Treatment involves stretching the wart, cutting it, or puncturing it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off.  Or, if desired, cauterize it with fire or a strong medicine, as previously described.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument I mentioned in the treatment of the ant.  The ant is also a small, hardened, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, extending deep into it.  When cold affects it, a sensation similar to the sting of ants is felt.
It occurs throughout the body, most often on the hands.  Treatment involves taking a tube made of strong goose or eagle feather and placing it around the ant, ensuring the tube encircles it completely. Then, rotate your hand with the tube until it breaks the skin around the ant.
And then push it deep into the flesh, and the ant will be pulled out from its root.  Or, if desired, you can do this with a copper or iron tube in this way:
The top of the tube should be solid and twisted, so it is easier for the fingers to control and turn it.  Or, if you prefer, cauterize the ant as previously described in the section on cauterizing warts.

Images of instruments used for injections in cases of rectal problems, diarrhea, and colic.
The injector can be made of silver, porcelain, or hollowed or hammered copper.  Small and large sizes of this instrument can be made for different users. Those used to treat small children, or those with tight or painful rectums, should be very slender.  Image of a large injector:.
The upper funnel, where the syringe is attached, is wide in this manner.  It has a partition where the syringe is attached, as you see.  The lower end that enters the rectum is very smooth and solid. On one side are two small holes, and on the other side is a single hole.
The size of the hole should be equal to or slightly thicker than a reed.  The syringe, in which medications are placed, made of animal bladder or sheep's intestine, should be shaped like a small spoon, with a diameter of a span.
It is pierced with many holes, as it turns, and there should be a distance of one finger's width between each hole.  Then, a strong thread of doubled yarn (of ten threads or so) is inserted into those holes and used to gather the syringe together like a spoon. When medication is placed inside, tighten the head of the injector between the stones firmly, then inject.  This is an image of the circular syringe and the hole.
The method of injection is to fill the intestine or bladder with the medication, warmed to a degree tolerated by the patient.  Beware that it is not too hot or too cold.  Then, the patient lies on their back with their legs raised.
A mat or blanket is placed beneath. Then, the tip of the injector is lubricated with ointment, egg white, or licorice saliva, or similar.  Then, it is gently inserted into the rectum.  The syringe's attendant grasps the syringe with both hands and squeezes it firmly until all the contents of the injector are emptied into the intestines.
Then the injector is removed, and the patient lowers their legs to the wall. If the medication is impelled to exit, the patient should hold it as long as possible.  If he sleeps with it all night, it will be more effective in the treatment.  If injected for diarrhea and expulsion is hastened, repeat the enema until recovery.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, the injector should be very gentle, smoother than the injectors used for children.  This is an image of a gentle injector, with its skin stretched tight.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the treatment of surgical wounds.
I have previously mentioned in the classification of the treatment of similar burns, and now I am describing here their treatment by hand and medication in full detail.  I say that wounds differ according to the thing causing the wound and according to the location of the wound.
The things that cause wounds are numerous, such as a blow from a stone, a cut from a sword or knife, a thrust from a spear or stick or arrow, and similar things.
As for wounds according to locations on the body, they are like a wound on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and similar organs.
And I will describe the treatment of some wounds to make them a standard and a rule for all other wounds, and I begin with the simple wounds of the head, especially as the compound ones will be mentioned in the first chapter of the third book of this book.
So I say that if a simple wound has occurred on the head, and it is not a bone fracture, I examine it. If it is from a blow with a stone or similar, and only the skin is bruised, and the wound is large, and I fear the occurrence of a burning swelling, then immediately lance the wound to release the pus. Do not delay this, and draw blood from him to the extent of his strength, if nothing prevents the bloodletting, and especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is scant.  Let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinking, and thick foods. If anything prevents bloodletting, then let him reduce his food intake, avoid meat and drinks, and apply a cloth soaked in rose oil, alone or with a drink that has a binding effect, to the wound if a burning swelling occurs.
And if you fear the burning swelling, apply to the wound, if it is fresh and has not been altered by the detrimental air, which I will describe to you shortly, and if it has been altered by the air, apply some ointments to it.
Until the pus is discharged, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and caused by a sword cut or similar, and its edges do not come together naturally, bring them together with sutures, as described in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging, and its attachment is only to a small flap, then cut it off. Then treat the wound with medicines that will build strong flesh to replace the skin.  Tell the patient to eat foods that have strength, such as heads of animals and similar items.
If a foul odor develops in the skin and it is not attached to the bone, cut away all the affected part and cauterize it. Then treat it. If in these wounds, an artery or vein is bleeding and the bleeding does not stop with the medications, search for the artery.
If you strike it and it does not stop bleeding, sever it with a scalpel and tie it off.  If the methods mentioned are not effective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops.  If these wounds are small and superficial, their treatment is easy and simple; just sprinkle this powder on them while they are still bleeding.
Before the air changes it, the recipe for the powder is: one part frankincense, two parts saffron, and three parts quicklime or unquenched lime.  Grind them all together, sift, and fill the wound with it.  Apply firm pressure so that it adheres well.
It will clot with the blood. Then, bind it from above with bandages and leave it without disturbing it as long as it does not swell.  The medicine will not be removed until it heals.  Quicklime alone can achieve this if you do not have frankincense and saffron.
This action can also be done with quicklime in many large wounds, if its application and binding are properly executed, and if the wounds are fresh and bleeding, and have not yet been affected by the air. However, if the wound has already undergone some change, especially during the summer,
Applying this powder is not effective in this case. Treat it as described earlier: apply some ripening ointments or a paste made from barley flour, water, and honey to encourage pus formation. Then treat it with further appropriate measures until healed.
If a minor fracture occurs in the bone, pull it with a splint.  The treatment of skull fractures is discussed in the section on neck injuries in the next section. If a wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment from a simple head wound.
If a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treatments that cause strong constriction, such as alum, verdigris, and the like, because they will injure and spasm the nerve.
Absolutely nothing cold should be applied to the wound, because the essence of the nerve is cold, and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  Use gentle remedies like moistened rose-water, repeatedly washed with fresh water, or diluted with oil or rose and zinc ointment.
Also wash with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner, and use moist remedies.  If the wound is large, use sutures or bring the edges together with strips, then treat until healed.
If the wound has a recess and pus has collected at the bottom, drain it from the lowest point.  If an artery has been severed and blood is flowing from the wound, tie it off, or cauterize it, if necessary.
If part or all of the hyoid bone has been severed, but the blood vessels are intact, bring together the skin edges with sutures on the hyoid cartilage. Do not touch the hyoid bone, but smooth it and return it to its natural shape, then tie it firmly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with astringent and drying ointments until healed. If the wound has affected the bone, probe it. If there are bone fragments, remove as many as possible. If not possible, leave it until the wound becomes necrotic and heals, making removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the powder we described. If the bone in the wound becomes necrotic and forms a fistula, treat it as described in the section on chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife, and you see a recess, examine it. If air comes out when the patient breathes, know that it is a fatal wound.  If there is no recess, and the wound is fresh with blood, do not immediately apply the powder, nor tighten it, lest the blood be trapped in the recess.
For it will return to the heart and kill the patient. Instead, apply a drawing ointment twice daily. If no ointment is available, place a used cotton swab in the wound mouth to absorb the moisture that comes out, and let the patient sleep with the wound facing upward.
To drain the accumulated material. If three days or more have passed, and the patient shows no spasms, bad palpitations, or shortness of breath, and their general condition is good, know that the wound is sound. Treat it with sutures and other remedies until healed.
If it is difficult to see and the wound discharge is continuous, know that it has become a fistula. Treat it according to that section.  The patient should lie on their back with the wound exposed, to drain any collected material.  If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it with the stitching previously described.
If it is large, or with powder if small, if it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, examine the wound and immediately remove those fragments if they are loose. If not loose, leave them until.
The wound will fester, then they will be easier to remove.  As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment is as previously described.
Eighty-fifth Chapter.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, the expulsion of the intestines, and their suturing.
A wound that appears on the abdomen may be large, small, or medium.  A large wound may expose one or several intestines, making their reintroduction and suturing more difficult and challenging.
A small wound, too, may present difficulty in another way, making its closure more challenging. If the intestines are not promptly returned to their position, they swell and thicken, making their return difficult.  For this reason, the most favorable wound is the medium-sized one, as it does not present the same difficulty in returning the intestines as do the other two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen has four aspects. Two sutures are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and other bodily wounds. The other two sutures are specific, applying to all wounds, but particularly suited to suturing the abdomen.
I will describe them to you one by one, with explanation. If the wound is small and something of the intestines has come out, and its return is difficult, this is due to one of two reasons: either the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestines have been puffed up due to the cold of the air.
If this is the case, it is necessary to warm it by dipping a sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water, alone or possibly boiled with saffron, frankincense, and myrrh and applying it to the intestines to dissolve the puffiness.
A drink with a constricting quality may also achieve this, being better than water alone for dissolving the puffiness. If you see that the puffiness has subsided, moisten the intestines with water in which hyssop or cumin has been boiled, as this will facilitate their entry with greater ease.
If, after this treatment, its return remains impossible, make a small incision in the wound using the instrument for piercing nostrils. The first treatment, if successful, is better than incision.  One only resorts to incision as a last resort, when all other attempts have failed.  This is an illustration of the instrument:.
Its one bent side is limited, and the other side is unlimited.  The thin end is not as slender as a scalpel, but is slightly blunt. It is an instrument resembling a small awl, as you see. If the wound widens and the intestine enters, it should be returned to its natural position.
Its specific location, if achievable, is best. However, if the wound is wide and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs elevated higher than their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, the head and chest should be elevated higher than the lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is in one side of the abdomen, always keep the side with the incision higher than the other.  This should be applied to major and minor surgical procedures.
For minor procedures, place it as best you can. Then, have a helpful assistant hold the entire wound with both hands, bringing the edges together, and then gradually expose portions of it to the surgeon performing the stitching.
This is the general method of single-stitch closure. Take a needle or several needles, appropriate to the size of the wound. Leave a space equal to the thickness of the little finger at the edge of the wound. Then, insert one needle, without thread, into the edges of the skin. With the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin, from the inside, so that it penetrates from that side.  The edges of the skin and peritoneum are brought together, forming four layers.  Then, a doubled thread is tightly wound around the needle on both sides until the edges of the wound are securely joined.
Then leave a space equal to the thickness of a finger and insert another needle. Then, thread it as you did with the first needle. Continue in this manner with as many needles as needed to completely close the wound. The needles should be of medium thickness.
Because needles that are too thin will quickly cut through the flesh, and thick needles are difficult to insert into the skin, therefore the needles should be of medium thickness.  And the needle should not be inserted into the skin edge too deeply.
So that the flesh does not tear quickly and the wound does not open before healing.  Also, do not space the stitches too widely so that the wound cannot heal. Then, cut the ends of the needles so they do not injure the patient during sleep.  Make protective coverings of linen material on each side to hold the ends of the needles.
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is best for smaller surgeries, as it may only require one or two needles, or so.
As for the method of stitching for a general wound, gather all four edges—that is, the two skin edges and the two peritoneum edges—in one stitching with a needle containing a thread of moderate thickness.  Then, after the needle has traversed these four edges, return the needle from the same side it entered.
So that the thread is interwoven at the top of the wound, making the stitch like the way sacks are sewn shut.  Leave a space between each stitch the size of a small fingertip. This stitch is known by everyone.
With this stitch, a surgical procedure was performed on a man who had a knife wound in his abdomen. The surgical incision was more than a span long, and approximately two spans of the small intestine had been exposed. The wound was located in the middle of the abdomen.
After the intestines had been exteriorized for twenty-four hours, the wound was closed.  It healed in about fifteen days, and he was treated until he recovered.  He subsequently lived for many years and remained fully functional.  Doctors had previously declared him incurable.
Surprisingly, I did not use any ointment, as I was in a location with no medications available. Instead, I applied used cotton to the wound twice daily and kept it moist with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the special types of stitches, I mention it according to Galen's text: Begin the stitching at the skin, inserting the needle from outside to inside.  Once the needle penetrates the skin and the muscle extending straight along the entire length of the abdomen...
Leave the peritoneum edge on the side where you inserted the needle.  Then, insert the needle into the other edge of the peritoneum from inside to outside.  If you insert it, re-insert it again into this same edge of the peritoneum from outside to inside.
Leave the peritoneum edge on this side and insert the needle into the other edge from inside to outside.  Simultaneously, as you insert it into the peritoneum, reach the peritoneum edge on its side, until the entire thing is penetrated.
Then, begin again from this same side, tracing along the peritoneum edge on the opposite side. Bring the needle out of the skin near it, then return it to that skin and trace the peritoneum edge on the opposite side with this edge of the peritoneum.
Bring it out of the skin on its side. Do this again and again, until the entire surgical wound is sewn in that manner.  The overall description of this stitching is like a furrier's stitching of furs.
By sewing the peritoneum once from one side with the skin edge and leaving it once from the other side until it is empty.  The second type of specialized stitching, which Galen also mentioned, is this in his words.
It is as if those practitioners sew it by bringing each part to its matching counterpart, naturally; thus they join the peritoneum edge to its other edge, and the peritoneum edge to its other edge, in the way I describe to you.
The needle should be inserted into the edge of the peritoneum nearest to you, from the outside, penetrating inward, and leaving the edges of the peritoneum. Then the needle is returned, penetrating from outside to inside at both edges of the peritoneum, and then returned again.
And penetrate it from inside to outside at the edge of the peritoneum on the other side. This type of stitching is better than the common, easy stitching previously mentioned. This is Galen's statement. Some have said that the abdominal wound may be stitched using two needles. This is done by inserting a single thread into both, beginning by inserting the needle from your side, penetrating to the other side, and inserting the other needle from the opposite side, penetrating from your side, according to the method of the leatherworkers' stitching.
Know that a perforation in the middle of the abdomen is more difficult to stitch than in other abdominal locations.  As for treating the wound, its treatment is like that of other wounds.  If you find the wound fresh with its blood, before the air changes it, and return the intestines to their place, stitch them, and make them firm, then apply the medicated dressings.
If the wound has been affected by the air, apply some of the available ointments until it suppurates and the stitches are shed, and the peritoneum and the peritoneum are joined together.  Then treat it like you would treat other wounds until it is healed.
If you do not have medications, apply powdered cotton from the start of the suppuration.  Change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.  You generally do not need any other treatment for uncomplicated wounds, if you fear the wound might cause pain to the main organs.
Therefore, you should dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpits. If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines, which often occurs, irrigate him with a lukewarm, black astringent drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestines and has become a penetrating wound into its cavity.  Know that the thicker portions of the intestines heal more easily, and the thinner portions heal more difficultly.
As for the jejunum, it does not accept healing from any wound that occurs within it at all, due to the abundance and thickness of its blood vessels, its thinness, and its proximity to the nerves.  However, if what has emerged from the wound is the mesentery and you have grasped it fresh, return it according to how you would return the intestines themselves.
If it has been a while and it has turned green or black, you should tie it with thread above the blackened area to prevent bleeding, as there are blood vessels and arteries in the mesentery. Then cut what is below that ligament.
You should leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside it, so it is easier for you to pull it and remove it when the mesentery falls off and the wound becomes suppurative.  Description of a wound that appears in the intestine.  Now, if a perforation appears in the intestine and it is small...
Sometimes, in some people, it can be repaired.  I have seen a person who had a wound in their abdomen from a spear thrust, the wound being on the right side of the stomach. The wound festered, and feces and air were coming out.  I treated it, though I did not expect it to heal. I continued to treat it until it healed and the area closed.  Seeing the area had closed, I feared that a mishap might occur in his abdomen.  However, absolutely no such mishap occurred.  He remained in the best possible condition. Indeed, he ate, drank, engaged in sexual intercourse, went to the bath, and exercised in his service.  Some experienced individuals have stated that if a wound occurs in the intestines and is small, it should be treated in this manner.
Large ants are to be taken and the edges of the wound are brought together.  Then, one ant, with its mouth open, is placed on the wound edges.  When the ant grasps and closes its mouth, its head is cut off; this will adhere and not separate.  Another ant is then placed near the first.
Continue doing this with several ants, according to the size of the wound.  Then close and stitch the wound.  Those heads remain adhered to the intestine until the intestine heals and is well, and no harm occurs to the patient. The intestine can also be sutured with fine thread.
To extract the animal's adhesive thread from the thread after it enters the needle, take the end of the thread from the animal adhesive, unravel it, then tie a thin, spun linen thread to its end, and finally thread that into the needle. The animal's adhesive thread is used to suture the intestines, and then returned to the abdomen. This method of suturing with ants and the animal adhesive is only a matter of hope and expectation.
However, if the rupture is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy and no cure at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On the treatment of the common cold and nasal discharge.
Know that any wound or tumor that becomes chronic, develops into an ulcer, and does not heal, constantly discharging pus without cessation, is generally called a fistula (nasoor) in any part of the body, and we call it a cold (zakaam), or fistula.
It is, in fact, a hard, dense, white mass with no pain, possessing a cavity like the hollow of a bird's feather.
For this reason, some called it a feather.  Sometimes it is moist, constantly discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture may cease.  This moisture may be abundant, scanty, thick, or thin.
I have previously stated in the classification of surgical conditions that any ulcer that does not heal and does not form new flesh, is due to one of nine causes. One of these is either a deficiency or poor quality of blood in the body, or there may be dense flesh within or along its edges preventing the growth of good flesh. Or, it may be due to excessive harm and dirt; or, the ulcer itself is putrid, and the material that discharges from it is poor in quality; or, the treatment is inappropriate; or, there is a widespread disease in the region; or, it is specific to that particular location.
Or, it may be due to excessive harm and dirt; or, the ulcer itself is putrid, and the material that discharges from it is poor in quality; or, the treatment is inappropriate; or, there is a widespread disease in the region; or, it is specific to that particular location. As was observed in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is slow, naturally, or it may be due to the presence of one or several bones.  All of these causes, their signs, and their treatments with remedies, I have outlined in the classification.
Here, I need to inform you of the treatment of abscesses and colds that occur through manual practice.  Know that abscesses can appear in all parts of the body, some leading to large veins, arteries, or nerves.
Or to the peritoneum, or the intestines, or the bladder, or a rib, or a vertebra of the spine, or a joint of the many-jointed limbs such as the hand and foot, and some lead close to a major organ, and the like.
Those abscesses of this type are among the difficult-to-heal illnesses, resistant to treatment, and their management involves great effort and ignorance. If the abscess does not reach the locations mentioned and one hopes for its treatment.
If you want to ascertain this, take a probe of copper or iron. If the abscess is straight, probe it with that. If the abscess has a curve, probe it with a thin lead probe, for lead is pliable.
If it enters and curves towards the curve, if the abscess has many openings that you cannot discern with the probe, inject one opening with moisture, for the moisture injected will flow towards the other openings.
Then, investigate thoroughly in any way possible to determine if there is a bone, a nerve, or if the abscess is deep or shallow, or if it is a single abscess with multiple openings.  Understand all of this to the best of your ability through examining the patient's pain when your hand touches the area.
And similar to this are the signs and causes that produce the tumor. If you ascertain all of this accurately, then proceed to treatment with confidence, by observing if...
If the abscess is superficial and close to the surface, or in a healthy area far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the places I have described, then open the abscess as previously described and remove the hardened material, corrupted flesh, and excess flesh from within.
And treat any flesh or warts that grow in its opening until it heals.  If the abscess is deep and located in a straight line, you should cut it open as deeply as possible and then clean it of all corrupted flesh.
Then use a twisted applicator soaked in potent medicine and insert it into the depths of the abscess that you can reach with the instrument; do this several times until the potent medicine consumes all remaining corruption within the abscess cavity.
Then apply ointments that promote healthy tissue growth until it heals. If it does not heal with this, cauterize it as previously described. If the cause of the abscess is bone, and you are certain of this, probe and open it as I have instructed you, unless something prevents you from doing so.
If it is a vein, nerve, or major organ, as we have said, if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness, then scrape it until the corruption disappears, then treat it with what will heal it until it heals, and if it does not heal, and the pus persists as it was before.
Know that you have not reached complete removal of all corruption.  Therefore, expose everything affected again, thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with all your effort, and then apply the remedy.  If it heals, then well and good.  If not, know that the corruption is deep and hidden.  Expose all affected areas once more.
Thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with all your effort. If the corrupted bone is small and you can pull it out, pull it out with the finest forceps suitable for that purpose.
If there are many bones, thoroughly remove them all; do not leave anything. If any ligaments or tissues obstruct, and their severance poses no danger, cut those ligaments and tissues, and extract the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones at this time, apply something to fester the wound, and leave it for some days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones fester.  Protect the wound; do not allow the incision you made during your work to close.
Instead, if you fear that, place on it cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian balm, or one of the green balms.  When those ligaments fester and the bones are loose, their removal and extraction will be easy.
If it is a single large bone, like a leg bone or thigh bone, and only its surface has decayed, scrape it thoroughly until the blackness and decay are gone, then close the wound.  If a large portion has decayed and the decay has reached the bone marrow, it must be spread out.
Cut it all the way to where the decay ends, then treat it until it heals.  I will tell you about a cold that affected a young man's leg to serve as an example and aid in your treatment.  This man was young.
Around thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to something moving from within his body until the material reached the leg and swelled into a large tumor.  There was no external cause.  Then time passed with the errors of the physicians until the swelling opened.
A large quantity of material flowed from it, and his treatment was poor, until the leg festered and became full of many openings, all emitting pus and bodily moisture.  A group of physicians treated him for approximately two years, but none of them were skillful in the art of surgery.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg, and material flowed from those openings in a great torrent. The man's body had wasted away, and his complexion had turned yellow. I inserted the probe into one of those openings, and it reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
I found that some of them connected to others from all sides of the leg.  I then incised one of those openings until I exposed some of the bone. I found it decayed, eaten away, blackened, putrid, and perforated.  The hole reached the marrow. I reported what I had discovered.
I removed the corrupted bone, and I believe that there was no other corruption in the bone than what I had cut and exposed. I believe I had extirpated it.  Then I applied healing remedies to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.  Then I again exposed the bone, further than the first time.
I found the corruption connected to the bone. I exposed whatever corruption I could see as well.  I tried to close it, but it did not heal or unite. I exposed it again. I continued to cut the bone piece by piece, and tried to close it, but it did not heal, until I cut off about a span of bone.
I removed it with its marrow, and then closed it with remedies. It healed quickly and recovered.  This repetition of work and incision was necessary due to the patient's weakness and susceptibility, and my fear that he would die.  Because he would repeatedly faint due to excessive vomiting, he recovered completely.
And solid flesh grew in place of the bone. His condition improved in his body, his strength returned, and he behaved normally.  He was not harmed by any difficulty while walking; if bone in any part of the body were broken.
Therefore, it is necessary to expose it in this manner: take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone.  Have someone pull it upwards. Then make another bandage of thicker wool than the first.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone, pulling the end to draw the flesh downward.  As you expose the flesh in the area you want to expose, so the saw does not injure it. Place a plank or board under the bone from below, securely.
Because if you do this, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the diseased bone.  The incision should be slightly above the affected area, so there is no decay in the bone cavity that does not appear on the surface, forcing you to make another incision.
If the bone is diseased but not protruding, and instead is connected but decayed within or in part, expose the flesh from all sides.  Then place the plank below, and then make the incision from the first side, where the decay is.
When you are finished with the incision, make another from the other side.  Let the incision be a little distance from the decay, as we have said.  If the decay is in a joint, cut the decayed joint itself and make an incision into the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the decay is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but removal. If the decay is in the finger or toe, treatment is very difficult. However, you should scrape away the decay however it appears to you, and remove and cleanse it by any means possible.
By any means that is possible for you, provided no nerve or artery is encountered.  Know that the saws and knives used to cut these bones vary according to the position, structure, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and porosity of the bones. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a tool suitable for each type of work.
Know that the work itself will show you the type of tool you need, if you possess long experience and knowledge of the arts of this craft, for the master of the craft, having witnessed many diseases, will be aware. He may thus invent tools that fit each disease, and I have illustrated for you various tools at the end of this chapter.
These serve as examples to be followed and a means of comparison with others, God willing.  Image of a saw:

Chapter eighty-seven.
In cutting off limbs and spreading bones.
Limbs may become rotten either from an external cause or an internal one. If you treat this decay with medicinal remedies and the treatment is not successful, and you see the decay spreading within the member, nothing stops it.
Then it is necessary to cut off that member to where the decay has reached so that the patient may be saved from death or from a great affliction which is greater than losing the member. A sign that this has afflicted someone is that the member becomes black, so you think that fire has burned it.
Or it may rot after becoming black, until that rot spreads to the parts adjacent to that member and affects the entire body.  Therefore, act quickly to cut it off.  Likewise, if the cause of the decay is the sting of some venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, snake, or centipede, and the like.
If the decay or the bite is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger, and do not delay the spread of the decay to the hand. Likewise, if it has reached the hand, cut it off from the base of the forearm, and do not delay the spread of the decay until it reaches the elbow of the arm.
Likewise, if it has reached the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow joint itself. If the decay has spread and you see it reaching towards the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder at all, for that will result in the patient's death.  Use other treatments as best you can.
Likewise, do the same with the leg. If decay has reached the toe, cut off the toe at one of the phalanges. If it has reached the foot, cut off the entire leg. If it ascends to the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to abandon it and allow the patient to succumb to death.  The method for cutting or dissecting a limb is to tie a bandage below the location you want to cut and another bandage above the location.
One attendant stretches the lower bandage downward, and another attendant stretches the upper bandage upward. You then expose the flesh between the bandages with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is uncovered.  Then cut or dissect.  And you should place linen cloths on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the correct place, causing the patient excessive pain and a hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, quickly cauterize the area or apply some sharp hemostatic agents, then return to your treatment until you are finished.
Then bandage the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals.  I will tell you about a similar case that occurred to a man in his leg:  a black discoloration with a burning sensation like fire.
This decay first appeared in his finger, and then spread to the entire limb. The man, upon seeing the decay spreading through the limb with the intense pain and burning, had it amputated at the joint, and he recovered.
After a long time, this same decay appeared again in his index finger.  He came to me, and I applied the remedies I had on hand to the affected area after cleansing his body.  The decay did not stop and continued to spread to the other finger.
Until the decay spread through the hand, and he urged me to amputate his hand.  I refused, hoping to stop the decay through treatment, and also fearing that amputation would cause his death, as he was near death.  When he lost hope in me, he left for his home.
I later heard that he eventually amputated his entire hand and recovered. I have recounted this story to be a guide and assistance in cases like this illness and as a model for their treatment.
Eighty-eighth Chapter.
On the treatment of abscesses and how to inject medications into them.
If a fleshy tumor forms in any part of the body and persists for a long time, accumulating matter, then bursts or opens, releasing all the accumulated matter, and the area remains empty, like a vessel.
The skin over it is like a tattered cloth, thin and not severely damaged, not affecting bone, nerve, or ligament.  For this reason, it deserves to be called an abscess, not a fistula, unless the duration is so long that the damage affects one of these structures.
In that case, it is called a fistula or ulcer.  The treatment is to cut away all that skin, as it circles around, especially if it has become thin and like a tattered cloth, and you are certain that it is not adhering to the area due to its damage.
If you suspect the skin is still adhering, and the damage has not reached that extent, and there is a layer of flesh in the skin, treat it with injection.  Observe the abscess; if it is large, and the pus emanating from it has a foul odor, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris, in equal parts, mixed in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens and becomes as thick as honey, then take what you need of it, dilute it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess.  Tie off the opening and leave the medicine in it for two hours.
Then remove it by pressing; do this for several days until the abscess is cleaned and the bad odor is gone.  You may inject with ash water if you do not have this medicine; this means taking ash from the wood of the vine or ash from oak wood and pouring water over it.
Then strain it and inject it until you are sure that the abscess has been cleansed. If the patient is not responding to Egyptian medicine or ash water, inject with water and honey mixed with a little powdered verdigris.
Or inject with honey and a drink mixed together, because honey cleanses and washes, and a drink adheres to the abscess, especially if the drink has a property of being binding and drying.  If you do this several times and are sure the abscess has been healed, then inject what will encourage flesh to grow there.
For example, take some palm ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and a binding drink, or inject with other medicines and ointments, the properties of which we have explained in the article on ointments. If the opening of the abscess is narrow and will not accommodate the syringe.
If it is narrow, widen it slightly with an iron tool, or place a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or Sirac ointment in it until it widens. Also, if the opening is wide, bring its edges together by stitching and leave open only enough room for the syringe to enter without more.
Also, if the opening from which pus is dripping is elevated, cut it at the lowest point to allow the pus to drain downward, because if pus is collected deep inside the abscess, it will prevent flesh from growing there.
If you cannot cut the abscess opening downwards as desired, then apply pressure to the affected area so that the pus flows out easily as is convenient, and do not allow any pus to remain inside at all.
As for the adhesive medicines that are applied to the abscess from the outside, and how to apply them, take one of the adhesive ointments that is suitable for your purpose and spread it over a linen cloth, making the cloth large enough to cover the entire abscess. Then, with scissors, cut a hole slightly larger than the opening of the abscess.  Spread some soft ointment on another cloth, the size of the hole, and apply it to the opening, keeping it a distance from the abscess opening so that the pus can drain out easily.  Do not remove the larger cloth until later.
For several days, the one on the abscess opening should be removed at all times so that the accumulated pus can drain out, and to know whether the pus that is draining is copious, scant, ripe, or unripe.
Moreover, examine the abscess site itself: does the patient feel pain there, or not; is there swelling, or not?  If your treatment continues in this way and you see the material that drains is scant at the abscess opening,
Know that the abscess has adhered, or is about to adhere.  Then treat it tomorrow or on the third day.  When you have treated the wound, change the cloths and renew the ointment.  If, after a long time, thin pus comes out of the abscess, do not despair of its adhesion.
For his healing is near, because some people have slow healing of flesh in their wounds, and others have the opposite; if, after many days, unripe pus comes out of the abscess, know that it has not adhered.  If the abscess adhesion is slow,
Then increase the drying medications, and let the medications be moist in consistency and dry in strength, like the palm ointment, if more colocynth has been added.  Among the most effective remedies is to use palm ointment.
It is treated with rose oil, and the moderate, thick herbal extract is sprinkled on it, and then you knead it together and use it.  A similar procedure can be performed if the palm ointment is unavailable; honey can be heated until it becomes thick and used; or you can take myrrh, aloes, and kender, grind them, and sprinkle them on the honey while it is heated. Then apply it to a cloth and bind it to the abscess, or apply the heated honey until it thickens, sprinkle the medicines on it, place cloths over it, and bind it.
Similar remedies can include long-stalked zeraun, the rhizome of the asmanjūn lily, kresnā flour, and rue, used singly or together, ground, sifted, and sprinkled on the honey described.  If the abscess persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption within it.
If it has affected the bones, or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it with the treatment for fistulas, as previously described.
Eighty-ninth chapter.
On treating the inflamed and injured nail, amputating excess finger, and separating fused fingers.
Dāḥis is excessive flesh that grows under the fingernail of the hand or foot, and possibly on other fingers. If left untreated, it will grow, swelling into a painful boil.
Or it may become corrupted and fester, eating away the base of the nail, perhaps even destroying the entire nail.  The corruption may reach the bone, giving off a foul odor, causing the end of the finger to widen and turn dark;  if treatment with the methods described in the classification is unsuccessful,
then one must cut away all the excess growth from the nail with a knife, and afterwards cauterize the wound. Cauterization is very beneficial in this case.  But if the bone and the nail are healthy,
and if the corner of the nail had pressed the flesh inwards, causing pain and irritation, then a thin pledget should be placed beneath the corner of the nail that is irritating the flesh, lifting it upward, and the flesh should be carefully cut away.
Apply caustic, burning medicines to the remaining flesh until it is all gone, then treat with ointments until it heals.  If the corruption has affected the bone, it must be cut out and removed, for the condition will never heal as long as there is corrupted bone present.
If you see decay and corruption spreading through the finger, amputate it at one of the phalanges, as previously mentioned, and then treat it until it heals.  If the nail has been struck or wounded and there is intense pain, one must first lance the affected area.
Then, using a sharp scalpel, split the nail with an oblique cut from top to bottom, taking care not to reach the flesh underneath the nail.  If you do, you will cause intense pain in the affected area and it will be a cause of excessive flesh growth at the site. Then treat the area with something to relieve the pain.
As for the extra finger that sometimes grows on people's hands, it may be entirely flesh, or it may contain bone, or even a nail, and some of it may grow at the base of a finger joint.
Or it may grow on some of the finger phalanges.  Those that grow on the phalanges of the finger do not move; those that grow at the finger joint might move.  Any that is purely flesh can be easily cut by severing it at its base with a wide scalpel.
However, if it grows at the base of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting it.  If it grows on the finger at one of the phalanges, one must first cut the flesh in a circular manner around the bone, then use one of those appropriate saws to expose the bone.
Then treat it until it heals.  As for the fusion that sometimes occurs between fingers, this frequently happens and can be a congenital condition or result from a wound, burn, or similar injury.  In such cases, the fusion must be separated.
So that the fingers return to their natural state.  Then place between them a linen or cloth soaked in rose oil so it does not quickly fuse, and separate them, or place a thin lead plate between them until the area heals properly.
Likewise, if fusion occurs between some fingers and the palm, separate the fusion in a way that best restores the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
In the cutting of the veins.
Veins are twisted, thick blood vessels filled with black, dark-colored phlegm, found in most parts of the body, and most commonly in the legs, particularly in those who travel frequently, are porters, and are laborers.  First, one should use frequent and vigorous rubbing of the body to remove the black phlegm.
Then, lance the affected area with a lancet.  Treatment with iron can be done in two ways: one is to cut and remove the black blood; the other is to sever the vein and remove it entirely.  For incision, first warm the leg with warm water.
Until the thick, murky blood dissolves.  Then, wrap the patient's leg from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage.  Then, make a wide incision in the vein in one place, or two places, or three.
Then, extract the black blood with your hand, from the bottom of the leg upwards and from the top downwards, until you remove an amount of blood that you consider sufficient, or as much as the patient's strength allows.  Then, tie it off and instruct him to avoid foods that produce black phlegm, and repeat the vomiting and the bloodletting.
When the veins become filled and this harms the patient,  as for severing, it should be done in this manner: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair, then put him in a bath and warm the leg with hot water until it turns red and sweats, or engage him in vigorous exercise.
If a bath is not available to warm the limb, then make a lengthwise incision in the skin over the vein, either near the knee or at the heel.  Then, open the skin with hooks and dissect the vein from all sides until it is visible to the touch.
When it appears, you will see it red and smooth.  Once it is freed from the skin, it will also appear like a tendon. Then, insert a probe beneath it until it is elevated and extends beyond the skin.  Hang it with a smooth, blunt hook. Then, make another incision close to that one, about the width of three fingers.
Then, dissect the skin off the vein until it is exposed.  Then, elevate it with the probe as you did before and hang it with another hook, as you did initially. Then make another incision, or several incisions, if necessary.
Then sever it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel.  Then pull and dissect it until it comes out of the second incision.  Then pull it to the incision above it and do this until you pull it from the third incision above all the others, until it is all out, and then cut it.
If pulling and dissecting do not work, insert a needle with a strong doubled thread, tie it, and pull. Insert the probe underneath and twist your hand in all directions until it comes out, and make sure it doesn't break, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult to dissect it.
This will cause harm to the patient.  If you have dissected it completely, apply wool soaked in a drink and rose oil or oil to the surgical site and treat it until it heals. If the vein is knotted, twisted, and has curves in various directions...
And if it is not straight, as we said, you should make an incision on every curve and twist in it.  Then hang it with hooks until you have dissected it entirely.  Be careful when making the incisions not to cut or injure the vein, for this will make it difficult for you to dissect it, and so conserve your efforts.
Image of the incision used for dissecting the vein.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not have a hook like other hooks, nor should its tip be sharp, so as not to injure the vein.  It should be thick and smooth in its bend, because if it is thin it will cut the vein with its thinness.  Rather, it should have the advantage of thickness, as we said.
Chapter Ninety-one.
In the vein of the civilian.
This vein arises in the legs in hot countries such as the Hijaz and the Arab lands, and in hot, sparsely fertile lands.  It may also arise in other parts of the body besides the legs, arising from an ulceration occurring beneath the skin.
As it occurs within the bodies of snakes and worms, and the ulceration of the gourd and the worm that breeds between the skin and the flesh. A sign of the beginning of this vein's appearance is a severe burning sensation in the leg, followed by the swelling of the affected area, and then the vein begins to emerge from the site of the swelling.
As if the root of a plant or an animal.  When its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one to two dirhams, tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it grows too large, cut off a portion and wrap the remainder. Do not cut it from the root before it has all emerged, for if you cut it, it will shrink and enter the flesh, causing a tumor, ulceration, and a foul sore in the area.
Therefore, it should be gently drawn out little by little until the entire vein is outside the body and nothing remains inside.  In some individuals, this vein may be as long as five or ten cubits.
I have been told that it emerged from a man's body as much as twenty cubits. If it breaks during treatment, insert a reed into the hole, and press it firmly against the body for a long time until all the material inside is released. Then, try to heal the area with remedies for several days.
Then treat it with the remedies for tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint or in the leg itself, causing many openings and branches emerging from each opening. Treat it as described in the classification and as previously mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Concerning the ulcer on the worm that develops under the jaw, known as the cattle disease.
This disease is called "cattle disease" in some of our countries, because it often affects cattle. It is a single small worm that develops between the skin and flesh, crawling throughout the body, both up and down.
Its movement from one part of the body to another can be felt, until it penetrates the skin, and emerges, forming a swelling from the putrefaction of certain humors, as occurs in worms, snakes, and gourd seeds in the abdomen.
Its danger lies in the fact that if it crawls through the body and ascends to the head and reaches the eye, it might break through it and exit, causing the eye to be lost.  This often occurs.  Therefore, if you wish to treat it and remove it, it can only be done when it is crawling and is perceptible to the touch.
Therefore, you should tie firmly with a bandage above and below it, then cut open over it and remove it. If it has burrowed into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply a cauterization with fire to the area until it is burned.  Its greatest potential harm is to the eye, as we have said.
If you see it has reached the head, near the eye, tie firmly under it on the forehead, then cut open over it and remove it.  The patient should maintain a cleansing of their body with laxatives for putrid humors, and be cautious of foods that create putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-three.
On the incision of the disease known as the 'naفر'.
This disease, called the "naفر" in our country, is a pain that appears in some organs and then moves from one organ to another.  I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a woman in distress in some rural area.  She bared her arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the arm's vein.  After an hour, I saw that swelling creeping up her arm along with the ulna, as a worm might climb, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as mercury could.
If it moved from one place to another, the pain would leave that spot and settle in the shoulder. Then, after an hour, it would spread throughout the body, even to the other arm.  She told me that it circulated her whole body, as I observed.
I was amazed by its rapid movement from one organ to another.  Before, I had only heard of this disease moving from one organ to another; but I had never seen it with my own eyes like I did in this woman.
I attributed this only to the fact that the woman was from the desert, lean of body, and with exposed veins.  From this, the moving pain became noticeable to the senses.  It should not appear in the same way in those of a refined lifestyle with moist, concealed veins and bodies.
If you wish to treat it, and the sufferer feels the pain, if it manifests itself visually as we described, then apply pressure above and below it quickly, and make incisions there, to allow the trapped wind/pain to come out.
If you do not see it, treat it with shaking the body and remedies that disperse wind, such as rotten bean and scabies bean, and similar medicines.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On extracting arrows.
Arrows vary according to their types and the locations where they strike the body.  As for their variation in type, some are large, some small; some are hollow glass, some solid glass; some have three angles, some four.
Some have tongues, some have splinters.  As for those that vary according to the organs they strike, there are two types: either the organs are hollow major organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. If an arrow strikes one of these organs, and signs of death, which I will describe to you later, appear, you should avoid extracting the arrow, for death will usually befall the owner. If these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not concealed deep within the organ, remove it and treat the wound.  And signs of the brain if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane covering the brain, include severe headache, fainting, and dizziness.
If these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not concealed deep within the organ, remove it and treat the wound.  And signs of the brain if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane covering the brain, include severe headache, fainting, and dizziness. Redness in the eyes and tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, vomiting, and possibly bleeding from the nostrils or ears.  Speech may cease, the voice may be lost, and a white, porridge-like moisture may emerge from the wound, accompanied by a watery discharge resembling the juice of meat.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and extracting the arrow, if it has not already been removed.  And as for the signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is near the left breast, and you feel it as if it has lodged in something solid, not hollow.
There may also be a pulsating motion from the arrow, and black blood may flow from the wound, followed by coldness in the limbs, cold sweat, and fainting.  Know then that death is inevitable.  And a sign of an arrow wounding the lung is a frothy discharge of blood from the wound.
The vessels near the neck swell, the patient's complexion changes, and he breathes heavily, seeking cool air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the small ribs, and the breathing will be heavy, with severe pain.
He sighs and all the muscles of the shoulders move. If the arrow strikes the liver, intense pain follows, and blood resembling the liver in color flows from the wound. If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food may emerge from the wound.
And his condition is evident.  If the arrow strikes the abdomen, and there is a rupture, with bowel or feces coming from the wound, there is no hope for treatment or removal of the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine emerges from the wound.
If something protrudes from the wound and the patient's pain intensifies, know that he is doomed.  As for other organs, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are more likely to survive.
Unless the arrow struck an artery or nerve, and was not poisoned, I tell you of some things I have observed regarding these arrows to help you in your treatment.  An arrow struck a man in the root of his nose, near his eye.
I extracted it from the other side, under the earlobe, and he recovered without harm to his eye.  I also extracted another arrow for a Jew that had lodged in the earlobe of his eye, under the lower eyelid.  The arrow was largely concealed, only its small, wooden tip remained visible.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, with a smooth, square iron tip, and no ears.  The Jew recovered without any further eye problems.  I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.  This arrow was Arab.
It had two ears, and I split it between the uvula. It had lodged deep in his throat, so I carefully removed it.  The Christian recovered and was healed.  I extracted another arrow from a man's abdomen; we judged that he would die from it.
After thirty days or so, with no change in his condition, I split the arrow and carefully extracted it. He recovered without further incident. I saw a man with an arrow in his back; the wound had closed over it.
Seven years later, the arrow emerged from the base of his thigh.  I saw a woman with an arrow in her abdomen; the wound had healed, and the arrow remained.  Her condition did not change, and she experienced no difficulty in her normal activities.
I saw another man with an arrow in his face; the wound had closed, and he experienced little pain.  Many such cases exist.  I extracted an arrow from the nose of a sultan's commander; it had lodged slightly to the right.
The arrowhead was completely hidden.  I was called to treat him three days after the arrow's penetration.  I found the arrow wound very small.  I probed it with a thin instrument and felt nothing.  He was experiencing a prickling sensation and pain under his ear, on the right side.
I hoped that the prickling was from the arrowhead, so I applied a dressing with a drawing and ripening effect, hoping that the area would swell and the arrow's location would become apparent so that I could extract it.  No sign developed to indicate the arrow's presence in that spot.
I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened.  The wound healed over. The patient despaired of extracting the arrow for a while until he felt it one day inside his nose. He told me.  I then applied a strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it. I felt the fine tip of the arrow that was embedded in the wood.  Then I further enlarged the wound with the strong medicine until the arrowhead became visible.  This took approximately four months.
Then, when the wound widened and I had access to it with forceps, I pulled and moved it, but it did not come out.  I continued to manipulate it with various instruments until one day I grasped it firmly with specialized forceps, as their image is presented at the end of the chapter.
The physicians had judged that his nasal cartilage could not be repaired, but I repaired it.  The wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, experiencing no further discomfort.  I am telling you how to remove some arrows so you may use this as an example and guide for those that I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped through description, nor encompassed by a book.  Instead, the skilled craftsman draws comparisons from the few to the many, from what is present to what is absent, and infers a new action and new instrument in the face of unusual cases.
If I descend from this craft, I say that arrows are extracted from the organs they have entered in two ways: either by pulling from the point of entry, or from the opposite side, which is the same as removing from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding into soft tissue, in which case it should be pulled out; if it does not come out at the time of the injury, you should leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh decays, making its removal easier.  The same applies if it is embedded in bone.
If it does not come out, leave it for several days and try pulling and moving it daily; it will then come out. If, after several days, it still does not come out, you should pierce around the arrow in the same bone from each side with a delicate drill to widen the space for the arrow, and then pull it out.
If the arrow is embedded in the skull, and has penetrated one of the brain cavities, and some of the symptoms I have described have appeared, then refrain from pulling out the arrow. Leave it for several days until its condition improves.
Then, proceed to pull out the arrow. If it is deeply embedded and difficult to remove, use the drills around the arrow as described previously, and then treat the wound until it heals.  If the arrow is hidden in a part of the body, If it is hidden from sight, probe for it with a sound, and if you locate it, pull it out with instruments suitable for the task.  If you cannot do so due to the narrow wound and the arrow's deep penetration, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way,
cut around it until the wound widens, and you can remove the arrow.  If it has two points, grasp them. Remove the flesh trapped between them from every direction with every possible means. If you are unable to remove the flesh, break the points and twist them until it is released.
When attempting to remove an arrow from any location, use your hand with forceps on all sides to extract it.  Be extremely gentle so the arrow does not break, making extraction difficult.  If you cannot remove it in your time,
leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh has become putrid.  Then try again, as it will be easier then. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments described in the relevant section.  Take care to avoid cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use your ingenuity.
Use every means possible to remove the arrow gently, carefully, and firmly, as described.  When pulling the arrow, the patient's position should be the same as when the arrow entered, which is most suitable.
If this is not possible, use any method you can.  As for an arrow emerging from the opposite side, either something will have protruded outward, or you will feel the arrowhead close to the skin's surface and see it protruding.
Cut the surrounding tissue to the extent that the forceps can fit inside. Then pull it out; it will be easier to remove. If it is lodged in bone, twist your hand in a circular motion so the arrow cuts into the bone, widening the space for itself, and then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days and try again until it comes out. If the arrow's shaft is still in place, push it out. If the shaft has fallen off and you want to use force, insert a hollow instrument into the arrowhead's shaft to guide it into the arrow's base and then push it out with the instrument.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that fits into the hollow. This will make it easier to remove. If the arrow is poisoned, you should remove all the poison from the affected flesh, if possible, then treat it with suitable remedies.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side, and is close enough to be felt with a probe, and you can make an incision, make the incision, being careful not to cut a nerve or blood vessel, and remove the arrow.
Then suture the wound if necessary, and treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps used to remove arrows:
Its tips are like the beak of a bird, crafted to be like a drill. If it grips an arrow or anything, it won't release.  There are various sizes made, large, small, and medium, all depending on the size of the arrow and the width of the wound.

Image of the solid cannon.
This one is solid at the tip, like a rod, to easily enter the hollow arrow and push it out.
Chapter Ninety-Five.
In the opening of veins.
The veins that customarily have been opened in the body are thirty.  Of these, sixteen are in the head; the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the *ḥussīsīn*; and the two arteries visible on the temples; and the two veins at the sockets of the eyes, known as the *nāẓirīn*.
And the vein that stands up in the middle of the forehead, and the vein in the tip of the nose, and the two veins in the neck, and the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins in the lower lip, and these veins known as the *jayārak*, and the two veins beneath the tongue.
And as for the veins that are opened in the arm and hand, they are five veins. One of them is the *qayfāl*, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the vein of the head.  And the *ʾaḵal*, which is the middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the *bāsaliq* and a branch from the *qayfāl*, and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the *bāsaliq*, which is located on the inner side, and is also called the *ʾibṭī*, and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen and the cord of the arm, which is located on the elbow, which is where it attaches, which is the one that appears clearly above the thumb, and the *ʾasīlim*.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, with two branches.  In the leg and foot, there are three veins: one under the bend of the knee, on the outer side; the second, the *ṣāfn*, is located at the heel, on the inner side; and the vein of the women, located at the heel, on the outer side.
And in the other leg, there are three veins like them.  As for the two veins behind the ears, their opening is beneficial for chronic colds, migraines, shingles, and chronic, malignant head sores, and their method of opening will be described.
This is done by shaving the patient's head, rubbing its back, in the location of the veins, with a rough cloth thoroughly.  Then the patient's neck is bound with a turban, until the veins appear, located behind the ears, in the lower parts of the head.  The veins are then felt with one's finger; where the pulsation is felt under the finger, the area is marked with ink.
Then, take a scalpel, known as the *naṣl*, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone. Then, lift the vein and skin upward and sever the vein with the skin, making a complete cut, the length of which should be the length of two fingers clenched together.
Or similar, and remove the amount of blood desired.  Then bind them with bandages and leave them until healed.  Their incision and cauterization were previously discussed in the beginning of the book.  As for the two arteries in the temples, their incision is beneficial for chronic migraines, severe headaches, persistent eye inflammation, and severe, persistent discharge into the eyes.
Their method of incision, as I will describe to you, is that the patient's neck is bound with a turban, until the veins become clearly visible, and their pulse is apparent under your finger. At that point, mark the location with ink.  Then, lift the skin over the vein from above with your index finger.
Insert the *naṣl* scalpel from below, lift the vein upward, and sever it as you did with the other veins.  Remove the blood to the desired extent. Then, release the patient's neckcloth and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Then place a cotton pad and bandage upon it, and bind it firmly from above. Leave it until healed.  Their incision, cauterization, and lancing were previously mentioned in the beginning of the book.  As for lancing the forehead vein, it is beneficial after lancing the temporal vein for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, sores, and persistent redness.
Its method of incision, as I describe to you, is that the patient's neck is bound with a turban until the vein appears.  Then, take the instrument called a *fāʾis*, and this is its image:.
Place the pointed spike at the head of the *fāʾis* on the same vein and strike from above with a comb or similar object. Allow the blood to flow as desired.  Then, release the patient's neckcloth and bind it until healed.
A wide scalpel may be used, but it should not be sharp-edged like other scalpels. Instead, it should be slightly wide-edged.  Incise it in a twisting motion, because the bone is close by.  A thin scalpel may break there.
As for the veins in the eye sockets, they are beneficial for eye ailments like scabies, redness, and blemishes, and facial diseases.  Their method of incision is that the patient should tighten their neck with a turban, and then you should incise them while standing over their head.  The incision should be slightly oblique and lengthwise with a small, somewhat wide scalpel.
If the area has little flesh, a thin-edged scalpel may break.  Then, take the amount of blood needed, place a bandage over them, and tie them up for one night.  Then, release the bindings.  As for incision of the nasal vein, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
Severe headaches and facial ailments like red bumps that appear on the nose, especially if chronic, are also treated by this method.  The procedure involves tightening the patient's neck, then holding their nose with your left hand, and using a long, thin scalpel.
Insert it into the center of the nostril itself, between the nasal passages, in a straight line.  The vein is not apparent to touch there, so blood will emerge immediately.  You should press the scalpel in slightly, draw off the required blood, and then tie it off for a night, as it will clot quickly.
As for the jugular veins, incision is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and melancholy diseases that appear on the skin's surface, such as black vitiligo, scabies, bad ulcers, and cankers.  The method for their incision is that the patient should tighten their neck under them with a bandage, and the practitioner should stand over the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, then the vein is incised lengthwise, with a slightly wide incision.  Then, the moderate amount of blood, or as much as needed, is drawn.  The same is done to the other vein, then the bandage is released.
The two veins are tightened moderately so that the patient does not suffocate, and left until the next day. The wound will heal.  As for the veins of the jaw, incision after incision of the jugular vein is beneficial for mouth ulcers, gum decay, bad ulcers, chapped lips, and bad ulcers.
Those that are in the nose and around it. The method of their incision is that you have the patient sit in front of you, tighten their neck with a turban, and then turn their lips outward. Look for the two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, and identify them by their blackness.
Also, around them are thin, black veins, which are to be cut off cleanly. If it is unclear to you and you do not know which to take, then proceed to cut the largest and clearest one.  Do the same for the veins on the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, incision after incision of the jugular vein is beneficial for the obstructions in the throat caused by sore throat and mouth diseases. The method of their incision is to have the patient sit before you, facing the sun, and raise their tongue.  Look under the tongue on one side for a vein and on the other side for a vein. Their color is toward black.
Incise them and be cautious; do not cut them deeply, for beneath them are arteries.  Excessive bleeding from those arteries might occur.  The three veins that are incised at the elbow are those customarily incised in all people.  Their incision can be done in two ways.
Either with a wide, herbal lancet, or olive-shaped lancet, to the point of tenderness; or with a knife-shaped lancet,  a lancet that is sharpened (and this is its form). The form of the wide herbal lancet is:
It is wide, as you see, to be suitable for opening hollow, full, protruding, visible, thick veins that contain thick, dark blood.  And this is the form of the olive-shaped lancet:
This lancet is narrower and more pointed, suitable for opening thin veins containing thin, yellowish blood. This is the form of the sharpened lancet.
This sharpened lancet, suitable for incision, comes in various widths and thicknesses, depending on the size of the veins.  It can also be used to discern other conditions; it is well-known among practitioners.
As for the jugular vein, which is one of these three veins, its benefit from being lanced is that it draws blood from ailments in the throat and neck area, including those near the chest and abdomen. The lancet-operator must be cautious when lancing it and should be aware of the underlying artery. If the incision goes astray and the lancet pierces the artery, it will cut the artery.
This will cause blood to spill, and therefore the lancing should not be done with a pointed lancet but with an incision made by a sharpened lancet.  If the jugular vein is not clearly visible, it should be avoided, and the practitioner should turn to another vein or look for a branch of it.
Alternatively, lance the arm's vein, as it is clear, and use the sharpened lancet, as we have said. If you wish to lance the jugular vein directly, then before tightening the arm, carefully feel the location to locate the pulse and then mark it with ink.
Then the arm is tied, and the vein is lanced with a deflected incision using the sharpened lancet, as we have said.  Carefully ensure that the strike is away from the artery's location. When you see swelling at the marked spot after tightening the ligature, that swelling is the expansion of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood during the lancing springing forth like a child's urine, and it is thin, red blood, know that it is from the artery.  Immediately, place your finger on it for a long time, and then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, it often does stop. Then tighten the arm.
Leave it alone, and warn the patient about neglecting it.  Let it remain on the neck and do not move it for days until it heals.  If the bleeding does not stop and you are not able to provide a remedy, then sever the artery if it is visible to you; for its ends will contract, and the bleeding will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell, split it, and use one half, firmly binding it to the affected vein using a bandage and splints until the next day.  If the bleeding stops, do so. Otherwise, treat it as previously described, using sharp cauterizing instruments for the bleeding.  Severing the blood vessels is not difficult in most cases.
Because the wound is small and the ligature is effective on the arm, know this.  As for the black vein, the benefit of lancing it is to draw blood from the top of the head and lower body, because it is composed of a branch from the basilic and a branch from the cephalic, as we have said.
The lancet operator should be careful when lancing.  Below the vein are nerves.  If the lancet is driven in too deeply and strikes a nerve, numbness will result, difficult to observe, and possibly not heal at all.  This nerve is often palpable.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin, not discernible, then you should lance it with a tearing motion and avoid the nerve to the best of your ability. If the vein is between two nerves, lance the vein lengthwise.  As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of lancing it is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye ailments.  If you wish to lance this vein in particular, it is better to use a pointed or a broad lancet, because it is the safest of all veins, as there is neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, when lancing, you should avoid striking the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek the soft spot.  If the vein is not struck on the first attempt, repeating the lancing procedure is not harmful. However, some individuals may experience swelling if not lanced on the first try.
But that swelling will do no harm.  Regarding the method of lancing, its symptoms, and what should be done to rectify them, first know that lancing is used solely to preserve health.
It may also be used for diseases.  To preserve health and maintain it, preventing illness, lancing should be done on one of the three veins in the elbow—the cephalic, the basilic, and the median cubital—in early spring, when signs of fullness appear.
Lancing should be done on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of the day have passed.  As for lancing used for illnesses, there is no specific time limit; it should be done when needed, whether night or day.
At any hour, at any time.  Boys should not be lanced until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should elderly men over sixty.  If someone intends to perform lancing for any reason...
He should cleanse his bowels before lancing with a gentle enema if there is much phlegm retained, lest foul matter from the intestines be drawn into the veins during lancing, harming the vital organs.  A feverish person, a drunkard, or an intoxicated person should not be lanced until these effects have subsided.
Also, avoid lancing after dysentery, vomiting, childbirth, excessive intercourse, exertion, exercise, late nights, fasting, and any physical or mental activity that weakens the body.  Then consider thinning the humors if the blood is thick.
Using foods, drinks, and medications, if possible.  He should then take a bath, if nothing prevents him, or engage in some exercise, to thin the blood.  Lancing should be done in the middle of the day, as we mentioned.  He should try to clear his mind of all negative thoughts that day.
Such as anxieties, anger, and fear, and all bodily afflictions such as excessive fatigue and exertion, intercourse, and similar things.  Let the objects that people are accustomed to use be present in his gathering, such as perfumes, herbs, amusements, and the like, each person to the extent he can.
Then the lancet-wielding physician sits on a higher cushion than the patient.  Then he extends the arm and rubs it with his hand two or three times. Then he tightens the bandage with the ligature, twisting it two or three times, with the tightening being moderate.
Because if the tightening is excessive, it prevents the flow of blood, or if it's too loose, it also prevents the flow of blood.  Then, after tightening, the patient should rub both of his hands together.
Until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch.  Then the surgeon should wipe the lancet with a small amount of old oil, specifically.  Then he should place his left index finger on the same vein, slightly below the place he wants to lance, so the vein is not pierced and is avoided. For some veins are like tendons, which retract during the lancing, and some are filled with air. If the lancet is placed on them, they recede beneath the lancet and deceive the surgeon, and the lancet does not open the vein. If it does open it, it is only a narrow opening.
Therefore, the surgeon should be cautious and deliberate in all these matters.  Then he lowers the lancet; if it opens the vein on that first attempt, well and good.  Otherwise, he should try again slightly below or above that spot; quickly, if the area has not swollen.
If the patient swells or suffers, leave it for a day or two. Do not tighten the bandage, as it may cause a hot swelling. He should not enter a bath. Then, he may have the lancing repeated if he wishes. If the lancet has been inserted and the opening is small, and the blood flow is thin.
And fearing that the desired amount of blood will not be released, reposition the lancet in the same hole gently and steadily; enlarge the opening slightly. Do this quickly before the area swells, because in many people a small opening can cause swelling.
If you see that it has swollen, do not return to it at all. It will not help. Apply some clarified oil to the area. It facilitates blood flow and is better in this location than plain oil or other ointments.
Use clarified oil in all your venesections when blood flow is difficult.  This remedy, the *Fariq*, and the *Shakhznaya*, if applied to the area, can also thin and dissolve thick blood.
If a large swelling occurs at the venesection site, which often happens, especially for someone who has not been lanced before or whose vein opening was small, then quickly apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water to the swelling and compress it for an hour.  It will dissolve.
This should be done after the blood has completely flowed from the vein itself or from another vein.  If a few days later, there remains some discoloration (black or green), it does not harm. If desired, apply some resolved (dissolved) opium and myrrh.
Or some of the juice of *Fawdeng* and the like.  A swelling and protuberance often occur when lancing the Basilic vein.  Apply your hand to it.  If you find it pulsates when you press it, this is a bad protuberance, so be careful not to apply any of the mentioned remedies.
For it may bleed arterial blood.  However, bandage it with something astringent to harden the area, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.  One should draw blood from each person proportionally to their strength and the prevailing color of their blood.
If the blood is dark, let it flow until it turns red.  Likewise, if you see it as thick, let it flow until it becomes thin.  Likewise, if it is sharp, let it flow until its sharpness subsides.  It is appropriate for someone who is strong and full and needs to draw blood all at once.
If strong, widen the vein incision and make the lancet wide. If weak, do the opposite.  The blood should be drawn in several stages, and the incision should be narrow.  The best instrument for lancing a vein is one that is curved, slanted, or a slit, not a puncture.
This type of lancing is free from bleeding and cutting nerves.  It is better and safer than lancing across or lengthwise.  If someone faints during lancing, one should feed them something like bread soaked in pomegranate juice or spiced sherbet before the procedure.
If he is feverish and has blood drawn three or four times, if his temperament is cold, let him eat bread soaked in myrrh drink or honey drink scented with herbs or a fragrant, herbal drink beforehand.
If fainting occurs during lancing and it is due to excessive blood loss, then he should be given meat broth and a light, fragrant drink.  Incense should be used, the chest should be gently sprayed with it, and all other treatments mentioned in the section on fainting should be employed.
That is from vomiting.  And as for someone wishing to loosen their arm and further release blood, someone whose lancing is for excessive vomiting and whose strength is weak, should have the blood released little by little according to their strength over consecutive days.
And as for someone wanting to loosen their arm and release blood a second time, if their body is strong, let them do so after seven or nine hours from the first lancing.  And as for someone wanting to draw blood from their body to the opposite side to which it has leaned, let them be loosened on the second or third day.
And if the body has much heated and intensified blood, causing fever, then blood should be drawn in one dose, a large amount, and the opening widened until fainting occurs, after having checked all the conditions of bloodletting. And that you place your hand on his pulse while the blood flows, lest death occur instead of fainting, for this often happens if the bloodletter is ignorant and negligence occurs.  This should not be done if you intend to loosen the arm and release blood a second time.
If the vein opening closes and blood flow is difficult, do not forcefully prod or twist it, as this is very harmful. Instead, either leave it until it can be lanced again or use a scalpel blade to remove any clotted blood from the vein opening.
Or apply something salty dissolved in water, or a powerful antidote (like faruq or shakhzanaia), and gently prod it until blood flows. If the vein has swollen, leave it.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If the need arises to release more blood, then either lancet above that spot, or lancet the other arm, or another vein.
As for lancing the arm vein, it is used instead of the temporal artery and basilic vein if those are unavailable or hidden, because it is a compound of them both.  The method for lancing it is that the patient should put their hand in warm water until the forearm reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible. Then, a moderate bandage is applied slightly above it.
Then, lance the vein slightly off center, neither horizontally nor vertically, and make the opening wide.  Make your incision slightly above the wrist joint. If blood flow is difficult, re-immerse the arm in hot water and allow the blood to flow into the water.
Until you have the amount you need. If it is summertime, you may dispense with re-immersion in hot water.  Re-immersion in hot water is most often used in winter.  Lancing this vein is the safest of all veins. Because there is no major vein or nerve beneath it.  As for lancing the ulnar vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method is to tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand, after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no major vein or nerve beneath it.  As for lancing the ulnar vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method is to tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand, after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells. The vein will be very apparent to the touch. Then lance it slightly off-center.  Even if you cut through it completely, this will not harm him.  Take care; do not use your instrument excessively.  Underneath is the nerve of the fingers, and the area is exposed without muscle. Then return the arm to the hot water.
Leave it to drain. If you do not return it to hot water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein and cease flowing. When you have extracted the desired amount of blood, apply a mixture of ointment and salt to the vein to prevent quick clotting.
The same should be done with every narrow branch.  As for the benefit of lancing the vein on the left hand, it is useful for spleen ailments.  Do the same in lancing it as you did in the second case.  As for lancing the saphenous vein, its benefit is for illnesses in the lower body, such as uterus ailments.
And menstrual retention, kidney ailments, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses. The method for lancing it is to immerse the leg in hot water and apply massage until the veins become visible. Then tie above the joint of the leg with a bandage. The vein is located near the heel, visible, like the thumb.
From it, many branches extend throughout the leg. Lance it in the widest branch, or at the heel where it joins, which is better and safer. If you lance it on the side of the leg, be cautious of the nerves beneath on the side of the leg.
Make your incision by angling, as if you were aiming for amputation.  Let the lancet be sharp.  If the blood flow is difficult, return the leg to hot water and allow the blood to drain out. If the lancing is unsuccessful the first time,
Then lance slightly higher; the area is safe and nothing to fear if you take care not to damage the nerve, as we said.  Do the same with the saphenous vein on the other leg.  As for the saphenous vein, its location is, as we said, at the heel, on the outer side.
Its use is for hip pain, if it arises from hot blood.  The method of lancing is to have the patient enter a bath and, quickly, to tie the leg from the hip to above the heel with a long, thin bandage, using four fingers. Only then will it appear.
If it appears, lance it, in any case, but preferably with an angled incision.  Alternatively, amputate or cut it.  The location is safe. In most people it is very hidden, so if you do not find it...
If it does not appear at all to the touch, lance some of its branches; these appear on the back of the foot, near the little and ring fingers.  Be careful not to damage the nerves and remove the amount of blood you desire.
Then loosen the bandage, place a compress on the lanced area, and bandage the spot.  It will quickly heal.
Chapter Ninety-six.
On cupping and how to use it.
Cups can be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass.  Cupping can be done in two ways: one with a mark and the removal of blood, and the other without a mark.
This cupping without a mark is done in two ways.
And the cups of the "akhda'ayn" (which are the sides of the neck on both sides), and cups of the chin, located beneath the lower jaw of the mouth, and cups of the shoulders, and cups of the coccyx on the tailbone, and cups of the elbows, which are the middles of the arms, and cups of the legs, and cups of the ankles.
Cupping draws blood from the thin veins dispersed in the flesh.  Therefore, it does not deplete strength like leeches.  Cupping, whether with or without fire, should not be used for any illness that is caused by fullness until the entire body is emptied.
If cupping is needed, whether for illness or custom, we use it at any time, at the beginning, end, or middle of the month.
For some people, when blood increases to the point that cupping is needed, they experience heaviness and headaches in their heads.  Others experience fullness, redness in their face, head, and neck.  Some experience itching in their face, side, and darkness and soreness in their eyes.  Others itch the area where the cups were placed.
Some laugh excessively, others taste blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit up blood.  Some sleep a lot, and others see blood, redness, dead bodies, and wounds in their dreams.  Whenever we see any of this,
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours have passed of the day.  The benefit of a single cup is to help with heaviness in the head and water dripping into the eyes.
However, it is necessary that this be done after the body has been emptied.  This cupping can be a replacement for venesection of the temples.  Caution should be taken that those with a cold head or a cold should not use it, as it will harm them greatly.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly or those with cold diseases in their heads, and those who become accustomed to it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, the cupper should lower the cup slightly downwards, for fear of causing forgetfulness.  As for cupping the shoulder, it is a replacement for venesection of the temples and the neck.
Therefore, it is helpful for asthma, shortness of breath, a split respiratory system, coughs, and fullness.  The cupping of the shoulder should be raised slightly, because if it is positioned lower, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it is beneficial for headaches, eye inflammation, migraines, choking, toothache, and is a replacement for venesection of the neck.  The cupper should be instructed not to deepen the insertion of the instrument, lest a vein be cut and bleeding occur.
As for cupping under the chin, it is beneficial for sores in the mouth, gum disease, and similar mouth ailments.  It may replace venesection of the veins in the lips.  As for cupping the shoulders, it is beneficial for palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
As for cupping the hollows of the forearms, it is beneficial for what the venesection of the three veins—the neck, temples, and groin—benefits.  Because it draws blood from all the fine veins in the flesh, and draws those fine veins from other thicker veins, until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to go too deep with the instrument, because the area is devoid of flesh and has nerves and arteries underneath.  As for a single cupping on the coccyx, it is beneficial for hemorrhoids and sores of the lower region.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large, brass cupping cup, as the area requires strong suction, and glass cupping vessels might break.  A great deal of pressure is required.  As for cupping the legs, it reduces fullness noticeably.
Because it draws blood from the entire body, and is beneficial for chronic pain in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder.  It stimulates menstruation and is beneficial for boils and abscesses.  It acts as a substitute for venesection of the neck and groin, but it greatly exhausts the body and fainting often occurs in most people. Cupping the groin is similar in benefit to cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping is to first place an empty cupping vessel and apply moderate suction.  Do not prolong the application of the cupping vessels, but rather apply and remove them quickly to allow the humours to flow evenly to the area.  Repeat this process until the area becomes red and open.
When the redness of blood appears, then apply pressure and resume suction gradually.  Then, consider the condition of the body. In those with delicate, porous flesh, a single pressure should suffice, lest the area become ulcerated.
The cupper should widen the pressure slightly and deepen it;  the suction should be gentle and with a slight movement. If the blood is thick, it should be pressed twice; the first time to open a path for the thin, watery blood, and the second time to fully remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very thick, the pressure should be repeated a third time to achieve the desired result.  In short, if we wish to remove a small amount of blood, one pressure is sufficient; if we want to remove a large amount, we should apply more pressure, especially if the blood is thick.
Therefore, a deep pressure should be applied, but the moderate depth of the pressure should only penetrate the skin.  What ointments and waters should be used when applying cupping, and what should the cupper avoid?  For those with thick, hard, dry skin and tight pores...
The places where cupping is to be applied should be rubbed with softening, opening, dissolving ointments.  In summer, for example,  ointments of  honey, violet, sweet almond, or pumpkin seed are suitable.
In winter, ointments of narcissus, lily, chamomile, or similar are suitable. If the blood is thick and cold, use ointments such as marjoram, dill, benzoin, or rue, and similar.
If the cupper has skin with open pores and soft flesh, then the use of ointment should be avoided.  These individuals should wash their cupping vessels after the procedure with rose water, cool water, elderberry water, pumpkin water, or similar waters.  As for those whose blood is very moist...
They should wash their cupping vessels with vinegar or rue and sumac water, and similar.  As for those with thick blood, they should wash their vessels with old wine, marjoram water, rue or chamomile decoctions, and similar.  Cupping should be avoided during and after bathing.
Rather, it should be used an hour or two after leaving the bath.  One should not sleep after cupping.  This is what the cupper and the blood-letter should consider before and after cupping.
First, it should be considered whether the cupper or blood-letter is bilious, with a predominance of heat and inflammation in their blood.  They should consume cooling foods such as pomegranate, endive, vinegar, lettuce, rosewater, and similar.  Their food should include fowl, lamb, lean meats, and similar.
If their temperament is cold, they should be given honeyed drinks, mead, or basil-seed rosewater.  They should consume moderately aged, aromatic wine, somewhere between old and new.  A limited diet is recommended, consisting of fowl, pigeons, sparrows, and doves.  The amount of drink should be more than the amount of food on the day of cupping and blood-letting.
In some cases, for some individuals, it may be appropriate to administer antidote, musk medicine, or shiltha before cupping or blood-letting, or afterwards, to strengthen the major organs and thin the blood.  However, it should not be given to those who are feverish.
As for cupping that does not require specific conditions, these are the cuppings applied to the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney area, and groin.  Because these organs cannot tolerate conditions, the purpose is either to draw blood from one organ to another.
For example, placing a cupping glass on the breasts in cases of epistaxis, or to remove a cold vapor that has collected in an organ, such as placing a cupping glass on the abdomen and navel.  This loosens the organ, warms it, and alleviates pain by dissolving that vapor.
Cupping may be applied to the kidneys if obstructions or stones are present, as its strong suction might open the blockage or dislodge the stones.  Similarly, it may be used on the liver and spleen when vapors are disturbed within them. These cupping procedures can also be used empty, by suction alone.
Cupping may be used with fire, or filled with lukewarm water for conditions like boils.  The cupping glass, preferably a large one, is filled with either hot water alone or water in which certain suitable herbs have been boiled.
Then, filled, it is placed on the affected area, held, and removed, repeated as needed. This is the method of using cupping with fire.
Its mouth opening is the width of two open fingers, as depicted, and its depth is about half a span.  A small hole, just large enough for a needle to fit, is made near the middle of one side of the cupping glass. It is crafted from thick-edged Chinese or brass.
It is smooth, flat, and polished so that it does not harm the organ when placed upon it.  A cross-shaped piece of brass or iron is in the middle to hold the burning candle. This cupping device can be made larger or smaller than described, depending on the ailment.
The user's skill is important; cupping for children and thin individuals is different from cupping for strong, robust adults.  The method for applying the cupping device with fire to the affected area involves taking a tightly-wound linen wick or a small pitch candle and placing it in the center of the hardened rod at the cupping device's center.
The fire should rise upwards toward the bottom of the cupping device, so that the patient's body is not burned.  Then, it is placed on the affected area. A finger is placed on the hole we mentioned, so that when the cupping device is held, the finger does not need to be removed.
Steam will emerge from that hole, and the cupping device will be released at the location. Then the wick is adjusted as needed.  A cupping device used for water-based sores does not have a hardened rod or a hole.
Instead, it is used by filling it with water and placing it directly onto the affected area. This is its appearance/image.
The larger the cupping device, the better, as it can hold more water.
Chapter Ninety-seven.
On the application of leeches.
Leech application is primarily used on parts of the body where cupping cannot be applied, either due to their small size, such as the lips and gums, or because the area lacks substantial flesh, like the fingers and nose.
To use them, select leeches from pure, uncontaminated fresh water, then keep them in fresh water for a day and a night to ensure they are hungry and have no food in their bellies. Then the body is first evacuated by bloodletting or cupping, then the affected area is cleansed.
Until it reddens, then the leech is placed upon it.  If it fills up and falls off, that is effective.  If the area can be cupped, this is more beneficial.  Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then copious water, and massage and squeeze it.  If, after the leeches have fallen off, bleeding continues as a trickle, then dampen a linen cloth in cold water.
Place it over the area until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered alum, or astringent, or similar coagulants, until the bleeding ceases, or apply peeled halves of chickpea.
Leave it until the chickpea adheres to the area, and the bleeding will stop.  If further leeches are needed, avoid using the same leeches if possible. If the leeches refuse to attach, wipe the area with fresh blood.
Or, pierce the area with a needle until some blood emerges, then apply the leech.  If it feels blood and attaches to the spot, if you want it to detach, sprinkle some powdered dates, salt or ash on it and it will fall off.
The Third Chapter.
Of fractures.
This chapter, too, is essential to the practice of medicine, concerning the setting of fractures and dislocations of bones.
Know, my children, that many ignorant physicians and laypeople claim to understand this chapter, having never examined the writings of the ancients or read a single word from them.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become extinct in our land, and I have never encountered a skilled practitioner of it. My understanding of it, however, came from extensive reading of the works of the ancients and diligent study to grasp their meaning.  Then, I devoted my entire life to experience and practice.
I have presented to you in this chapter everything my knowledge encompasses. After presenting and clarifying it for you, I have refined it, removing unnecessary verbiage, condensing it to the utmost brevity, and explaining it thoroughly.  I have also depicted numerous examples of the instruments used in this art.
This is an added clarification, as I have done in the previous two chapters.  There is no power except through God, the Exalted, the Great.
The First Chapter.
This chapter contains a summary of the essentials of bone fracture treatment.  Before we begin describing individual fractured and dislocated limbs, it is necessary to discuss general principles and sections in this chapter. This will first necessitate your understanding and grasping of its truth, you and any others eager to learn this noble craft.
So I say that whenever a fracture, dislocation, or injury from a fall occurs, one should first hasten to reduce the fracture or dislocation, or both. Unless prevented by factors like weakness or if the person involved is a child or very old person, or if the time is extremely hot or cold.
Then, his diet should be limited to cold legumes, poultry, and venison.  Drinks, fatty meats, overeating, and all foods that fill the veins with blood should be avoided, until the swelling subsides and the risk of fluid accumulation at the site is minimized.
Then, the patient should return to his original diet, as was his custom.  If the fractured bone begins to knit, the patient should consume foods that are nourishing, thick, and strong, with a viscous quality, such as lentils, rice, heads of vegetables, and beef tripe. Eggs, soft fish, thick drinks, and similar foods.  With this regimen, the fracture will knit faster and better.  Know that fractured bones in strong men and the elderly will not always unite to their original state.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, the joining of bones may not be as complete as in the supple bones of young children. However, nature produces a substance resembling glue, thick and adhesive, on all sides of the fractured bone, attaching and holding the parts together.
Connecting them until they achieve the same strength and security as before, so that nothing hinders their functions.
For this reason, the patient's diet should consist of foods that are strong, viscous, and thick, as we have mentioned.  Know that fractures vary depending on the affected body part, as a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest differs from a fracture of the spine.
And so too are all the other parts different from one another. We will discuss each type of fracture in detail in its own section. The type of bone fracture may also vary within itself.
Because a fracture may be a simple break without splinters, or it may be along the length of the bone with splinters and detached or non-detached fragments.  The fracture may also involve a wound and tearing of the skin, or it may be a slight crack.
Each type has a specific method for its treatment, as will be explained in detail in its place.  A sign of a fractured bone is its deformity, its prominence, its visibility, and its creaking sound when touched with the hand.
If there is no visible deformity, no creaking sound, and no pain or discomfort when examining the bone, and the patient does not experience much pain, there is no fracture; it could be a sprain, a mild fracture, or a slight crack.  Therefore, it should not be moved, prodded, or manipulated at all.
Instead, apply the appropriate remedies to be discussed later, then apply a gentle bandage.  Know that if the bone is fractured and compressed with two forces without splintering, then each part has moved away from its counterpart.
You should immediately attempt to realign and adjust it before a hot swelling develops. If a hot swelling occurs, leave it for several days until it subsides, then adjust it gently and using any possible method.
Know that realigning and adjusting a bone is easier than one with splinters. Then, it will be bandaged as described later. If the bone has splinters, the fractured limb (whether an arm or leg) must be stretched from both ends.
Either by your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with both ropes and hands.  Position the limb on a level surface in its natural shape.  Once the fractured bone parts have been extended, carefully and gently return the protruding parts to their proper positions.
Strive to avoid causing pain or discomfort to the patient through your actions.  Do your best to reunite the two bone fragments in the best possible position.  At that time, you should touch and feel them with your hands. If you find anything out of place, adjust and correct it to the best of your ability.
Avoid excessive stretching and forceful prodding, as many ignorant practitioners do.  Often, they cause a hot swelling or inflammation in the limb through their actions, as I have witnessed repeatedly.
After the realignment, careful adjustment, and bandaging, keep the limb still and quiet. Warn the patient not to move it during wakefulness, sleep, turning over, restlessness, bowel movements, or any other activity.  The patient should ensure that the limb's position prevents pain.
If, while in that position, the patient feels pain or discomfort in the limb, he should change the position to one that does not cause pain.  He should also ensure that this new position is straight and even.
So that the limb does not become crooked if it is set.  As for how to bandage a broken limb, as I describe to you, know that broken limbs vary in size, shape, and condition.  Small ones, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and similar parts...
The bandages for small limbs should be soft and gentle, while for larger ones, like the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be strong and firm.  A wide bandage is necessary for a large limb, holding it securely and evenly on all sides, free of any irregularities.
Then, after completing the realignment, apply the appropriate plaster. Using a soft bandage, cover the fracture site.  Then, wrap the bandage three or four times around the fracture itself, depending on the limb's size.  Slightly tighten the bandage, and then continue it upward from the fracture site.
Tighten the bandage less than you did on the fracture site.  Then, gradually loosen the bandage as you move away from the fracture.  Gradually work to realign the limb until it is properly positioned.  Then, use another bandage to wrap the fracture site.
Wrap the bandage several times, then continue down the fracture site.  Maintain the tension and looseness of the wrapping as described in the first, upper wrap.  Place soft padding or bandages between the layers to correct any misalignment of the fracture.
If there is misalignment, do not add padding. Otherwise, apply another bandage. Then, apply firm splints to these layers, if there is no swelling or inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or inflammation, apply something to reduce the swelling and dispel the puffiness. Leave it for a few days, then apply the splints.  The splints should be made from wide, properly shaped reeds or from ebony wood.
Made of pine, palm fronds, reeds, or similar readily available materials, each splint should be of this exact size and shape.
However, the splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others. The splint's length should be appropriate to the size of the fractured limb.  Shape of the splint:
Then, bind the splints with another bandage, in the same way as the first.  Tie firmly on top with strong thread, increasing the tightness over the fracture site. The less tightness should be used the further from the fracture.
The threads should be of medium thickness and not too thin, preferably made from moist linen.  For threads that are thick, like those made by ignorant people from twisted linen strips, is a serious mistake.
Because the tightness is then uncontrolled.  Thin threads are also unsuitable, as the desired tightness cannot be achieved.  There should be at least a finger's width between the splints.
If the patient is irritated by the edges of the splints after tightening in the correct places, place soft padding or fluffy wool underneath so that nothing irritates him.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and a skin perforation, we will discuss that separately.
Know that not every fractured limb needs to be splinted from the first day.  If the limb is large, splints should not be applied until five or seven days, or longer, depending on your confidence that inflammatory swelling will not occur.
This is a description of the bandages used by the ancients to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  It is a simple, concise bandage that sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is neither excessively hot nor cold.
Take the flour dust, the fine particles clinging to the millstones during operation, and knead it as it is, without sifting it with egg white.  Make the dough neither thick nor thin, then bake it.
Another bandage for fractures, dislocations, and sprains: Take ten dirhams each of mastic, ladanum, acacia, frankincense, myrrh, and saffron; five dirhams each of gum arabic and licorice; and twenty dirhams each of gum arabic/Roman clay and Armenian clay. Grind all the ingredients together and mix them with gum arabic water, or with egg white if the patient's temperament is hot.  Using this bandage, which is well-combined, quickly sets fractured bones and is suitable for most people due to its balanced nature.
Another bandage, also beneficial for fractures and sprains: take ten dirhams each of myrrh, mastic, and white hellebore; five dirhams each of gum arabic and licorice; six dirhams of acacia; and twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind all thoroughly, sift, and knead with water or egg white, then apply.
A bandage for dislocated joints and bones, relieving pain, and treating bone splintering and fractures: Take prepared wool, dip it in cooked vinegar and oil, and apply it to the affected area.  This bandage does not possess the strength to set a fracture.
However, it is excellent for relieving hot swelling and pain. Another bandage for setting a fractured bone: take unripe fig leaves and wild poppy leaves, grind them together, and apply to the wound in a wet state. Another, brief bandage to use when a bone is fractured.
To resolve the remaining swelling, take portions of hellebore root, chamomile, violet, and quince flour, grind them all together, and knead them with plaster if the limb is not inflamed.  If it is inflamed, knead with coriander water or water, and apply.
Another stronger resolving bandage, used when a hard swelling occurs after a bone fracture: take a portion of each of the following: hellebore root, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, violet, and chamomile.
Grind them all together and knead with vinegar water, or fresh water, or plaster; this depends on the limb's heat and the calming of its heat.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that this should be applied to a fractured limb during setting.
Except for the plaster made from wax and oil only, and he described it as being intermediate in thickness between thick and thin.  As for Galen, he believed that things containing dryness and some heat, such as myrrh, gentian, and frankincense, and similar things should be placed on the fractured limb during setting.
A bandage recipe for weakness and pain: Take mugwort, chickpeas, human hair (or bird feathers), hellebore, and salt, all in equal parts.  Grind, sift, knead, and apply as a bandage.  As for the appropriate amount of ligament that should remain...
Then, it should be removed.  See if the patient experiences no pain, no rubbing, nor movement of the fractured bone from its place.  Do not remove it for many days.  However, if there is severe rubbing, disturbing pain, or swelling in the area, [remove the bandage].
Quickly remove it at once; do not delay.  Remove the bandage.  Then take a soft cloth or a damp sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the itching and pain subside.  Then allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Then apply softened wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bind it for the night.  To soothe the hot swelling and ease the swelling and pain of the limb.  Then, reapply gentle pressure and a light bandage, but not as tight as the initial bandage.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and swelling have completely disappeared, and a bandage and pressure are needed, reapply as you did initially.  If nothing mentioned above occurs in the limb.
Do not remove it until after three, four, five, or seven days.  Sometimes it may be left for twenty days; all depending on the condition of the limb as we have said, until the fracture is firm and the flesh has begun to heal around it.
Then, in that case, increase the pressure even more than your initial pressure, and also increase the patient's nourishment as previously mentioned.  If you observe that the fracture site is dried up and wasted more than necessary, know that nourishment is not reaching it.
Then, bathe it with lukewarm water each time you remove it, and do so every three days.  Ease the pressure slightly.  By this action, nourishment will reach the limb and it will heal quickly. As for what the ignorant among the setters of broken limbs do, of breaking the limb again...
Because if it is not set properly the first time, and is set crookedly, that is an error on their part and a great deception.  Even if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it.  I have seen no trace of this from any of them at all. The correct approach is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
Concerning fractures occurring in the head.
Fractures of the head are numerous, their forms varied, and their causes diverse. Some fractures result from sword blows, and the bone may be broken all the way to the peritoneum beneath the bone. As happens with wood when it is struck.
And this type of fracture is therefore called a 'struck' fracture.  Alternatively, the sword's cut may have broken only part of the bone, and its edge alone was fractured, without the cut reaching through completely; this type is called an outright fracture. The wound caused by these two types of fractures may be large or small.
Some fractures are caused by a blow with a stone or a fall on a stone or the like, resulting in a contusion or a bruise.  This fracture may either penetrate and approach the membrane beneath the bone, or else be limited to the surface of the bone.
And the wound of these fractures too may be either large or small. Some fractures are hidden within the bone, subtle, like a slight fissure.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.  A fracture of this type may occur due to a fall, or a blow from a stone or similar object, forcing a portion of the bone inward, causing a depression in the area, similar to how a copper object might be dented by a blow, with a part of it being driven inward.
This is most common in the spongy bone of the head, such as in children's heads. All of these fracture types may have splintered and un-splintered fragments. We will describe the treatment of all of these in their respective places, and we will identify all these fracture types by examining them.
By probing them and removing any putrefied flesh from them.  The hairline fracture is recognized by examining the bone, and rubbing and staining it with ink; the fracture will appear black.  As for the treatment of the fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms.
If you observe obvious signs of danger, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of awareness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, then do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is certain in most cases with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not cause great concern, and hope for his recovery, then proceed to treat him.  This is if the injured person comes to you soon after the injury, during the winter months.
You should endeavor to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, in any case.  If it is during the summer months, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane beneath the bone deteriorates and the symptoms we described appear.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is crushing and injury, you must cut away the crushed and injured part as I describe to you.  This is by shaving the head of the injured patient.
And expose the bone in whatever way possible, and according to the shape of the wound and what is causing discomfort to the patient. If during the exposure of the bone, you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling, then treat it appropriately.
This means to fill the area with cloths soaked in rosewater and ointment, and clean the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding is controlled.  Then, begin to turn and remove the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.
One method is to cut the bone with a narrow, precise incision, and this is its illustration.
Then, you use another incision wider than the previous one, and this is its illustration.
Then use yet another incision, wider still than the second.  You should have a set of different incisions, some wider than others, some shorter than others, all with extremely sharp edges, made of Indian steel or good quality steel.
Use gentle pressure when striking the incision to avoid jarring the head and causing further harm. If the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary to drill around it before using the incisions with the drills they called "non-dipping drills.
Because they do not penetrate the bone of the skull beyond, for the drill has a rounded edge beneath its sharp head, similar to a ring or small circle, preventing it from sinking and going beyond the thickness of the bone.
You should have many such drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that for each skull, you have a drill whose sharp point is appropriate in length and shortness to the thickness of that skull.  This is an illustration of three types. Of drills, large, medium, and small.
As for how to drill around the fractured bone, place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then move the drill to another location, and space each drill hole by the thickness of a reed or similar.
Then cut between each two holes with the chisels, doing so with the utmost gentleness, as we said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with another instrument you have prepared for this.
Such as bone saws and fine forceps.  You must be very careful that the drill or chisel touches no part of the peritoneum. If you have smoothed the bone, freed it from the peritoneum, if it was attached, and extracted it, then you must clean it.
And smooth any roughness remaining on the bone with another instrument similar to a chisel, though it must be finer and gentler than other chisels.  If any small pieces or fragments of bone remain, remove them gently with the instruments available.
Then treat the wound afterward with the compresses and ointments mentioned.  The other approach to the procedure is very straightforward, free from danger. Galen mentioned and praised it greatly. This is what he said. First, you should begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and prominent.  Once you have exposed that part, you should place the tip of this lens-shaped chisel beneath it.  This is its image:.
The lens-shaped part of it should be smooth, so it does not cut anything.  The sharp part of it, on its long sides, will be as you see it, so the lens-shaped part rests against the peritoneum, and the sharp edge of the chisel against the bone. Then strike the chisel from one side.
With a small hammer, so that you gently sever all of the bone as it turns.  And you are safe from the membrane; no frightening accident will occur, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he is asleep.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in certain places, scrape it off with the tip of the lens-shaped chisel itself, and remove it gently.  It will come off without harm or fear.
If the fracture of the bone did not penetrate to the membrane, and the broken bone's surface remained rough and with splinters, then you should scrape off those roughnesses and remove those splinters using small tools of various sizes.  This way you can use the most appropriate one for each place, according to what the work indicates.
The fractured bone itself and its shape; you should use the widest of these tools for scraping first, then use a narrower one after, and continue doing this, in order to arrive at the use of the narrowest and thinnest of them all.
For all the smaller, hair-like fractures and gentle breaks, you must apply a treatment to each one according to what will bring about its repair.  This is something not hidden from anyone with even the slightest training in this craft and who has considered what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, you should take a linen cloth sized to the wound, soak it in rose-oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. Then take another cloth, folded or triangular-shaped. Soak it in rose-water and rose-oil, and place it on the first cloth.  Do this as gently as possible so as not to burden the peritoneum.  Then use a wide bandage over it, and do not tighten it except to the degree that it holds the wound only.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two until the hot swelling subsides.  Then remove it and apply afterwards the medicines that are known for their drying qualities, such as the roots of lilies, the flour of the kresna, the powders of kandar and zarawand, and the like.  Make these into poultices.
Dust the wound with them as they are dry. In general, use a medicine that cleanses without stinging.  Do your utmost while treating the wound to ensure that it is clean, free of grease, dirt, or pus, and that no pus collects within it at all.
Because if pus collects on the meninges, it corrupts and rots them, causing a great illness to the patient, and this may occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If a blackness appears on its surface, then if the patient displays the symptoms we have mentioned, know that he is doomed without fail.  And if the blackness occurred because of a medicine applied to it, and the potency of that medicine was such as to produce that blackness.
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, blend them well, and apply them to a cloth. Then place it on the peritoneum and treat it with the necessary remedies until it heals.
Chapter Three.
In setting a fractured nose.
Know that only the upper halves of the nose, or one of them, can break, since they are bones. The lower part is cartilaginous and does not break, but rather is subject to contusions, deviations, and flattening.
If one of its halves is fractured, you should insert the little finger into the nostril and straighten the fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside, so that you restore the nose to its natural shape.  Do this gently, ensuring that your actions do not cause pain to the patient.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then it should be straightened with a blunt instrument. If the fracture is in both sides, do the same.  He should begin the reduction on the first day following the fracture.
If possible, and otherwise after seven or ten days when the inflammation has subsided, you should insert a thread of linen into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or two threads if the fracture is on both sides.
The thread should be thick enough to fill the nostril.  Some early physicians recommend soaking the thread in ghee and changing it daily.  However, I do not think this is necessary, but instead the thread should be soaked in beaten egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the thread in place until the bone has set and the cartilage has solidified.  After the thread is in place, you can insert goose quill tubes wrapped in soft linen into the nostril. This will provide a stronger hold for the fracture and prevent the patient from having difficulty breathing.
This is not essential.  If you wish, use the threads, or if you prefer, perform the procedure using the threads.  If inflammation develops in the nose during your procedure, bandage the nose with a piece of linen cloth or cotton dipped in vinegar, rose oil, or a diachylon ointment.
If no inflammation develops, you should bandage the outside of the nose with a mixture of semolina, finely ground kandar (a type of resin), and beaten egg white, then place a soft compress on top. Do not bind the nose at all, especially if the nasal bones have been fractured only slightly.
Or if it has fragmented, you should dissect the fragments, remove them with a suitable instrument, then suture the gap and treat it with ointments appropriate for healing and suppuration. If a wound occurs inside the nose, treat it with thread and use lead tubes. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On setting fractured lower jawbones.
If the lower jaw is fractured but not accompanied by an open wound, and if the fracture is only from the outside, and not fractured in two and not concave inward, then its identification is easy.
If the fracture is on the right side, one should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth.  Likewise, if the fracture is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand and gently lift the fracture bump from the inside outward.
With your other hand on the outside of the bone, you control its alignment.  If the jaw fracture has split into two, then traction should be applied from both sides to straighten it.  If it has affected the teeth, they should be gently separated.
Or, if any part is likely to separate, tie it with a gold, silver, or linen thread.  Then, apply a splint to the fractured jaw, then place a folded cloth over the splint and finally a large, firm bandage or a piece of leather equal in length to the jaw. Then tie it securely above, as best you can to hold it together, so it doesn't move.  Instruct the patient to rest and be quiet.  Give the patient soft food.  If you suspect a change in shape, loosen it on the third day.
Then tie it securely above, as best you can to hold it together, so it doesn't move.  Instruct the patient to rest and be quiet.  Give the patient soft food.  If you suspect a change in shape, loosen it on the third day. Then, fix the bandage with flour dust mixed with egg white or semolina, after removing the splint.  Apply a soft compress to the bandage.  As long as the bandage stays on and the bone's condition doesn't change, leave it in place.
Do not remove it until the fracture heals and strengthens.  The fracture often strengthens in three weeks. If a hot swelling appears during that time, use the methods we mentioned previously to calm it until it subsides.
If the fracture is accompanied by an open wound, and a piece or pieces of bone have separated, gently remove the pieces with an appropriate tool. If the wound is narrow, widen it with forceps as needed.
Then, if you have removed all the pieces of bone, suture the wound if it is wide.  Otherwise, apply one of the suitable ointments. And treat the wound until it heals.
Fifth Chapter.
On the treatment of a fractured collarbone.
The collarbone is most often fractured from the front, at the end of the shoulder blade.  The fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks and splinters in two without creating fragments, which is the easiest to treat;
or the fracture may create fragments, which is more difficult to treat; or the fracture may be accompanied by a wound.  If the fracture is without a wound, have two assistants; one to hold the upper arm adjacent to the fractured collarbone, and the other to extend the neck to the opposite side.
Then adjust the fracture with your fingers until it is properly aligned, without any bumps or irregularities.  If further extension is necessary, a ball of linen or wool should be placed under the patient's armpit.
Adjust the bone as needed, extending and lifting the collarbone, and pressing the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you cannot pull the end of the collarbone outwards because it has sunk inwards, the patient should lie on their back.
A medium-sized cushion is placed under the patient's shoulder. The assistant presses down on the shoulder to raise the sunken portion of the collarbone.  Then the fracture is corrected and aligned with the fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the collarbone has broken off and is moving, you should gently separate it.  If the fragment is embedded in the bone, you should use one of the instruments prepared for this purpose to carefully remove it. After the instrument that protects the pleura, which is made of wood or iron, is placed under the collarbone, this is its image/form.
It resembles a spoon, without any curves. Its width should be adjusted to the size of the bone, and its length according to the required work.  It should have two ends, one wider and the other narrower, as you see.
If the wound you created to remove the bone fragment is wide and you fear inflammation, stitch the edges of the wound together. If the wound is small, or you fear serious inflammation, treat the wound with sutures and bandages according to the size of the wound.
If there is a hot inflammation, soak the bandages in rose oil and vinegar or a drink, and apply them.  As for a fracture, if there is no wound or incision, apply a bandage made of mill dust mixed with egg white to the bone. Place a soft splint on it, then place a ball under his armpit if needed. Then take a very long bandage, about a span wide or so.  Apply a folded bandage over the splint and dressing. Then take a splint made of thin wood. Its width should be three fingers and the same in length. Then wrap it in a cloth, then place that cloth with the splint in the part of the bandage over the fracture. Then tie the bandage around the fracture as you would with a turban. Tie it to his neck and under his healthy armpit and under his injured armpit, and repeatedly tighten it on each side.  As you see, the tightening secures the fracture firmly, which is clear to you.
The whole point is that the splint should not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day.  Whenever the ligaments relax and you see the splint has moved, correct it and tighten the bandage.  Then, have the patient sleep on their back, and place a small pillow under their armpit at night.
To raise his arm away from his side, so that the clavicle fracture rises with the shoulder blade, or tie his arm to his neck. Do not loosen the bandage unless a wound or swelling occurs at the site within twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see reason to do so. Maintain the tension and leave it until the clavicle fracture is healed and the bond is strong, and it becomes even stronger over twenty-eight days. It may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
On the reduction of a fractured shoulder.  The shoulder rarely fractures in its wide portion, but rather its edges.  Thus, if a part of it breaks or fractures are in the middle, it is known by touch.  Then, according to the shape of the fracture, apply a splint.
Align it and restore it to its natural shape by all possible means. Then, apply mill dust, egg white, and soft linen on the area, and place a folded cloth pad on top. Finally, place a wide splint made of a plank over it.
Make the splint as wide as the entire shoulder or slightly wider. If there is a depression under the splint in any part of the shoulder, smooth the depression with soft linen until the splint is level, then bind a long turban over it.
Secure the splint firmly so that it does not shift from its position.  Examine the bandage daily, and tighten it whenever it loosens.  Realign the splint if it moves.  The patient should lie on his sound side, and the shoulder will be healed in twenty days.
For one or twenty-five days. Once this period is complete, remove the bandage, confident that it will not harm the bone;  for it is one of the bones that one does not fear shattering or displacement. If a fragment of bone protrudes and is piercing the skin, make an incision over it and remove it. Do what I mentioned for a fractured collarbone concerning the treatment of any inflammation that may occur.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of fractured ribs.
The chest may fracture in the middle, though this is rare.  Its extremities are more prone to fracture and splintering.  If the middle breaks, symptoms include a downward tilt, severe pain, and difficulty breathing, along with coughing.
Blood may also be coughed up, and the fracture in the bone becomes evident, easily discernible to the touch.  To treat it, the patient lies on their back, a cushion placed between their shoulder blades.  Then, the patient's sides are pressed together, and the ribs are brought together with the hands, from both sides, carefully aligned on all possible surfaces.
And hold it until the bone returns to its proper shape.  Then, apply a bandage and splint, placing on top a splint made of thin board of poplar, willow, or similar lightweight material, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then carefully tie it to the fractured bone to prevent displacement.  Wind the bandage around the back in a circular motion several times and tighten it firmly.  Then, check the bandage frequently, tightening it whenever it loosens.
And if the injury necessitates its removal due to a wound, pain, or swelling at the site, then promptly remove it, and take off the bandage.  Correct any issue that has arisen with appropriate treatment; then, reapply the bandage if deemed necessary. Apply to it and maintain the compression until healed.
Chapter Eight.
In the setting of fractured ribs, know that fractures occur in the thick parts of the ribs near the spine, and their anterior extremities;  they are prone to injury because they are cartilaginous.  This knowledge is readily apparent to the touch when examining with the fingers.
Treat the fracture by aligning the broken pieces with the fingers until the shape is corrected.  Then, bandage and compress the fractured bone with a splint if necessary.  If the ribs are fractured inward, the patient will experience severe pain.
And the pain is like the pain that occurs in those with a hernia, because the bone pierces the diaphragm and also causes difficulty breathing, coughing, and profuse bleeding. This is a difficult condition to treat, and the ancients used many methods to address it.
Some said that the patient should consume foods that produce flatulence and wind to inflate the abdomen and push the fractured bone outward.  We discourage this, lest it exacerbate the development of inflammation if it has not yet occurred; and if inflammation has already begun, it will worsen and confirm its presence.
Some said that a cupping device should be applied to the area, and then strongly suctioned.  This is more logical, but one fears that the cupping device might pull substances to the area due to its weakness.  Others said that the area should be covered with wool dipped in hot oil.
The space between the ribs becomes filled in, so that the ligament is flat if wrapped around the circumference.  Then the patient is treated for the hernia, with diet and medicine.  If the patient is severely strained, they cannot endure it. The bone was piercing the diaphragm painfully, and we feared for the patient.  Therefore, it is necessary to cut open the area, expose the fractured rib, then place the instrument that protects the peritoneum, as previously described, underneath it and gently remove the bone.
Then, if the wound is large, we stitch the edges together and treat it with ointments until it heals.  If inflammation occurs during this process, immediately apply rose-oil-soaked dressings to the affected area and treat the patient internally to reduce the swelling.
He should lie on the side on which he sleeps more easily until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of spinal and neck fractures.
If the neck bones are fractured, this is rare; more often, they are bruised.  The same applies to the vertebrae of the spine.  If this occurs to someone and you want to know whether they will recover or not... If you observe that his hands are relaxed, numb, and lifeless, and he cannot move, extend, or grasp them; if, when you pinch or prick them with a needle, he feels no sensation or pain, know that in most cases he will not recover; he is doomed.
But if he can move them and feel the pinching and pricking, know that the marrow of the bone has been spared, and the patient will recover with treatment.  If a spinal fracture presents similarly, and you want to know whether recovery is possible...
Examine his legs.  If you find that they are relaxed, and the same condition as the hands has occurred, and then, when he lies on his back, wind and feces are expelled involuntarily, and when he lies on his stomach, urine is expelled involuntarily... And if, when he lies on his back, he is unable to urinate, know that he is doomed, and do not bother with treatment. If none of these things occur, the matter is less serious.  Treatment for what has happened should aim at relieving the inflammatory swelling.
By placing rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks, on the affected vertebra three times a day, until the inflammatory swelling subsides.  Then apply one of the strengthening, dry dressings to the area and bind it with a bandage.  Instruct him to rest and remain still.
He should sleep only on the side that does not cause pain until he recovers. If a splinter or something detached from the bone has occurred during the injury, the skin should be incised and the detached bone extracted. Then, if the wound is large, the edges should be brought together with sutures.  Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals.  If the last bone of the coccyx, the tailbone, is broken, the little finger of the left hand should be inserted into the rectum.
The broken bone should be aligned with the other hand as much as possible.  Then apply a bandage and splint, if necessary, and bind it.
If you feel a fractured splinter in it, incise it and remove it. Treat the wound with the previous treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
The bones of the thighs rarely fracture. If they do fracture, the fracture is usually a splintering at the ends, a longitudinal crack, and inward displacement.  The affected person experiences pain, stabbing, and numbness in the leg on the fractured side.
To set it, run your hand over it to determine the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, straighten the ends to the best of your ability, matching the natural shape.
If the fracture is longitudinal, or has shifted inward, lay the patient on his stomach until you can set the fracture.  Once you have straightened it, apply bandages, and then a splint of wood or leather, securing it firmly.
Do not fear that the fracture will shift or that the splint will loosen.  Fill the hollows of the hips with padding until the splint is evenly fitted.  Instruct the patient to sleep on his back or his healthy side, if a hot swelling appears.
Refrain from manipulating or setting it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply whatever remedies are appropriate, as previously mentioned.  Then, resume setting and securing it properly.  If fragments or splinters appear in the bone, do not remove them.
Do not touch it internally, but straighten it externally, as we have said. Leave it secured until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On setting a fractured humerus.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, set it using one of two methods. One method is to take a smooth, slightly curved stick, medium thickness, in this manner:
Tie straps to its ends, then hang it from a high point. The patient sits in a chair, then places the broken arm on the stick so that the armpit lies against the middle curve of the stick. Then hang a heavy object from above it.
Or a servant can pull it downwards, and then the physician aligns the fracture with his hands until the fracture is restored to its proper position; and the other method is that the patient lies on his back, and the arm is suspended from the neck by a bandage.
Then order two servants; one to hold the part above the fracture in his hands, and the other to hold the part below it; and each of them to pull in their direction. If you want a stronger pull, tie a bandage below the fracture and another above it, and have each servant pull towards their respective sides.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, the bandage should be placed under the armpit, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow. Likewise, if the fracture is near the elbow, the bandage should be placed in that location and on the elbow itself.
Then the fracture is aligned gently, without force, until it is properly aligned and fits well.  Then it is tightened, unless a hot swelling appears. If a hot swelling does appear, leave tightening until the seventh day.  Apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides.  Then tighten it.  The method of tightening is to place the dressing on the fracture, then place a folded piece of new cloth over the dressing.  Then bring the arm back to the upper arm, and place the hand open on the shoulder.
Hold the cloths and tightening on the upper arm and forearm, so that the arm acts as a splint, if nothing prevents you from doing so and there has been no change in the broken bone. If you fear a change in the bone, use splints.
The splint placed on the fracture itself should be wider and stronger than the other splints.  A space of one finger's width should be between each splint.  The length of the splints should be according to the fracture, with an additional three finger-widths on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tightening described in the first section.
It is that your tightening should be more intense at the site of the fracture.
The further away from the fracture, the less the tightening.  If you see the placement of the splints and tightening, as we mentioned, during the setting of the limb, do so.
If you fear a hot swelling, leave the tightening and splints until the seventh day, as we said.  Then examine the ligaments every three days, lest irritation or swelling occur in the area, or food be prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening.  All this is rectified as mentioned.
If you are confident that none of this will occur, do not loosen the ligaments until many days have passed.  The patient should lie on their back, their hand on their abdomen.  A padded arm sling filled with wool should be placed under the arm.
Examine at all times, night or day, lest the fractured limb's shape change or the ligament relax.  Correct all of this with your effort.  Make the patient's diet as we previously described, first gentle, until the bone strengthens.
Then the diet should be made thicker.  The arm and leg usually strengthen in forty days.  At that time, the ligaments should be loosened, and baths should be used, and treated with ointments suitable for that, if the fracture is extensive and complicated.
Do not loosen the ligaments until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
In the setting of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the radii. One is small, and it is the one next to the thumb. The other is large, and it is located under the smaller one, below. It may happen that only the larger radius is broken, or only the smaller one, or both may be broken.
If the upper small radius is broken, its setting is easy and its healing is quicker. If the lower radius is broken, the fracture is worse and healing is more difficult. The worst case is when both bones are broken.  If the broken bone is the upper small radius...
Therefore, the physician must, when setting it, make the traction gentle and slight to align it. If the larger radius is fractured, the traction must be stronger. If both radii are fractured, the traction must be very strong indeed.
The hand should be positioned during the setting and traction, stretched out on a cushion. The thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers. The pinky finger should be lower than the other fingers. The patient should be seated upright.
The cushion should be at the same height so that the patient does not have to strain.
Then, an attendant will support the arm from below, either by hand or with a bandage, and another attendant will support it from above.  Then the physician will align the bone to the best possible position. If the fracture has splinters, they should be adjusted.
Adjust each splinter back into its place using your best effort. If a detached splinter appears, piercing the skin, and you have no hope of setting it, then cut around it and remove it as previously described.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate chapter addresses it.
If, at the beginning of the setting, a hot swelling appears, apply a compress made from rose-oil-infused beeswax.  The compress should be medium thickness, and apply gentle pressure until the swelling subsides.
Remove the compress and apply a bandage made of mill dust and egg white.  Then apply the splints.  The splint covering the fracture itself should be wider and stronger.  Know that, in most cases, six splints are needed for the arm.
The fracture may be in one ulna or in both ulnas.  Then, make your traction stronger at the fracture site.  As you move the traction upward or downward, gradually lessen the tension, as previously mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.
The bandages wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not overly stiff.  The thread used for traction should be linen, of medium thickness as described.  Inspect the limb and ligaments after several days.
If a problem arises, such as irritation on the limb, warm water should be applied to the affected area until the irritation subsides. The limb should be left untensioned for a night to rest, then traction should be resumed.
If the traction has become slack and the bone has shifted, or similar problems have occurred, correct everything to the best of your ability.  Also, if the limb is not receiving enough nourishment due to excessive traction, it should be relaxed slightly and left for a few days until nourishment returns, then the traction should be tightened again.
If none of the previously mentioned problems arise, the patient should not be released until twenty days or so.  Then, hang the patient's arm from their neck, keeping the arm straight.  They should avoid strenuous movements and sleep on their back.
Know that this arm fracture is set within thirty days, or thirty-two days, and perhaps even twenty-eight days, all depending on the individual's constitution and strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of fractures of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpals and phalanges of the fingers rarely fracture, but are often injured.  When a fracture or injury occurs to the hand...
The patient should sit in a position of rest, with a chair in front of him at a proper height.
Then, the patient places his hand outstretched on the chair.  The attendant should then straighten the fractured bones, and the physician should adjust them until a proper alignment is achieved.  At this point, a dressing and splint should be applied, unless a hot swelling has developed, and then a brace should be applied over the area.
Wrap it in a soft cloth.  If the fracture is towards the palm of the hand, make a ball shape from cloth.  Instruct the patient to grasp it with their injured hand.  Then tie it with a long cloth.
The splint should be made of soft leather, so the skin can heal with the flexing of the entire hand, and it should be tightened as needed. If the fracture is outward, then the splint should be placed on top and another one beneath the hand to keep the hand open and upright.
Then, the bandage should be applied as the hand is rotated, and the fingers should be fastened together with a bandage.  If the fracture is to one of the fingers, if it is the thumb, adjust it properly, and then bandage it with the hand. Or, if desired, make a small separate splint to straighten the fracture.
Do not move it. If the fracture is in any of the other fingers, such as the middle, index, ring, or little finger, straighten them and bandage them to the adjacent, healthy finger, or bandage them all together.  This is best.  Or, place a small, upright splint on them.
As we stated for the thumb, examine carefully after setting the fracture and after the hot swelling subsides.  Treat any problems that arise according to the descriptions given earlier.
Chapter Fourteen.
On setting a fractured thigh.
The thighbone often fractures and is easily felt, as it shifts back and forth.  It is set by placing a bandage above the fracture and another below, with the patient lying on their face.
Then each attendant pulls the bandage towards their side, keeping it straight, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.  However, if it is close to the hip joint, a soft bandage, either of wool or similar material, should be used.
At the hip joint, towards the pubic area, the pull should be upwards, and the other bandage downwards, below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee, and the pull should be downwards.  Then the physician should straighten the bone with both hands until it returns to its normal shape.
The bone will heal well.  At that point, the bandage and traction should be maintained unless a hot swelling develops on the limb.  If swelling occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, and then return to treatment.
For traction, a wide, strong bandage should be wrapped around the fracture twice or three times, with excess material left over.  Then, the leg should be twisted so that the heel is near the hip joint. A long thread should be inserted between the thigh and leg near the lower knee area, with the thread ends extending from both sides above.
Then, wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.  Then, place splints over the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and create a single splint over the shin bone. Fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft padding so the traction is even.
Then, begin with strong traction from the middle, over the fracture site, three or four times.  The further the bandage is from the fracture site, the less strong and looser the traction should be.
Then, take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg and tie them to the adjacent splints above.  Then, bring the thread ends down to the ankle and use them to secure the other ends of the splints.
So that the bandage does not slip out of position.  Then, maintain the traction as long as there is no pain, swelling, or inflammation in the limb. If any of this happens, immediately loosen the bandage and correct any problem, as we have described repeatedly.
If there is a protruding fragment of bone, it should be smoothed if possible. Otherwise, it should be cut and removed. Treat the wound as previously described until healed.  This thigh fracture may be treated without also splinting the leg.
As we mentioned regarding the humerus and arm,  however, treating it this way will not cause the patient lameness.  But if it is treated in isolation, without the leg being joined, the patient will always be lame.
Know that a fracture of the thigh takes fifty days, or slightly more or less, depending on the variations in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
In fractures of the patella.
The patella rarely fractures, but is often bruised. If a fracture does occur, it is either a split or a fragmentation of its parts, and this may occur with or without a wound.
One must rely on observation in all this, and set the fracture by aligning the separated parts with the fingers until they are brought together and united, as accurately as possible with gentleness and precision. Then, apply a bandage and a circular splint if necessary.
And apply a further bandage consistent with this, and then treat all situations as described for other fractures, such as inflammation, and the like, by addressing each symptom with an appropriate remedy until healing.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the setting of a fractured shin.
The shin has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the ulna.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the arm bones. Therefore, its setting is like that of the arm, the procedure being the same. If both bones are fractured, the leg will turn in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg will turn forward; if the thicker bone is fractured, and this occurs from below, this is evident to you.
Therefore, use traction and realignment, and bind the splints accordingly, with the same procedure; however, if the fracture of the leg is severe with many fragments, the traction should be less and gentler, and take care in setting it.
There is an additional step in treating the leg compared to the arm.  Once you have realigned the splints and completed all your work, take two pieces of pinewood—used for leveling rooms, placed between the gaps in planks, or similar, from palm leaves or similar material.
Choose from them a piece of moderate thickness, not thin, and let its length be the length of the leg from the knee down. Then wrap two layers of cloth around each one lengthwise. Place one on the leg, and the other on the opposite side.
Let it be from the knee to the bottom of the foot. Then tie the two pieces of wood in three places, at the ends and the middle.  With this restraint, the leg will not tilt left or right, and will be well-supported.  A groove of wood may also be used along the length of the leg.
Place it [the groove/restraint] to prevent movement, especially when the fracture is accompanied by a wound.  Check the leg daily and watch carefully for swelling or puffiness, or any other sign. If anything of that sort occurs, treat it accordingly until it heals.  The leg bone will set within thirty days or thereabouts.
Chapter Seventeen.
In the fracture of the bones of the leg and fingers.
The heel bone is rarely fractured.  The bones of the leg may be fractured, and the fingers are also rarely fractured, but rather are mostly bruised.
If a fracture of the leg bones occurs, and you see that some of the bones are overlapping, have the patient stand on the ground with their foot upright as if walking, then place your foot on the raised bones and press them down until they are level.
Until they return to their proper positions. Then take the bandage and splint, place a small, flat board with two ends under the sole of the foot. Securely bind the foot with the bandages and any other materials you require.
After three or four days, release the bandage.  You will find the bones level, whether they were fractured or dislocated.  The procedure is as described.  If some of the fingers are fractured, manipulate and align them, as described for the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the fractured finger, lengthwise and slightly wider than the finger itself.  Place the board I previously described under the foot, and secure it tightly.  If two, three, or more bones are fractured.
Make a splint for each finger, sized appropriately and wrapped in soft cloth.  Secure the board under the foot, ensuring each end of the board extends beyond the sole of the foot for good support.
You should not forget to treat all the fractures as described, addressing each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
Fractures of the woman's pubic bone and the man's pubic bone.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, have her sit down, leaning her body back slightly, with support from behind.  Then, have the midwife pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and forms a ball shape within her vulva.
Then, the woman should move and slightly raise her pelvis, causing the cotton to come out until it is like a ball at the entrance of the vulva, and the fracture of the bone is reduced.  Then, a pad is placed on her back. When she wishes to urinate, gently remove the cotton so she can urinate.
And reposition it in the same manner as it was initially placed, then return to the original pad.  Do this for seven days, or similar, and it will heal.  If you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a reed tube around its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her vulva.
Then, blow forcefully into the tube to inflate the bladder within the vulva, which will reduce the fracture.  Then pack it with cotton and maintain the described care for several days until healed.  As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, this method is used for its reduction.
Its application is as described for the hip bone.  The correct procedure for these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, is clear to you, especially if you have some experience and understand this book of mine well, for the fracture itself usually shows you the way.
Follow the correct procedure for its reduction and strengthening.  As for the penis of a man, if it is fractured, take a goose's windpipe, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it and bandage it.  Leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the reduction of bone fractures if there is a wound.
If someone presents with a fracture and a wound, especially if the bone is large like the femur or humerus, or similar, one should promptly perform phlebotomy if the conditions for venesection, as previously described, are met.
If the wound is bleeding, one should promptly cauterize it by applying powdered alum if nothing else is available.  Then proceed to set the fracture on that same day; do not delay.
If no inflammation occurs, if inflammation does occur, then delay the setting until the ninth day, until the inflammation subsides. Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, as it will expose it to undesirable symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin, exposed, then you should gently attempt to reposition and align it with your hands and a slight extension.  If you cannot reposition and align it with your hands, reposition it using this instrument, which is made of iron, seven or eight fingers in length. And its width should match the wound.
Therefore, the physician should take three or four of these, as needed for treatment in each type of fracture.  They should be round, with a slight thickness so that they do not bend when prodded during use.
It should have a sharp point, a bend at the tip, thicker at the top and gradually thinner towards the bottom.  This is its image/shape:.
It is called a "perem" in Greek, meaning a small lever.  The sharp, bent tip should be placed on the protruding bone end and used to push it back.  Once the bone has returned and is somewhat aligned, use the tool to align the fractured bone ends.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it properly, the end of that bone should be cut so that the instrument can hold it. If the bone cannot be brought back as described, cut it using a similar instrument from the ones we have mentioned.
Or saw it open with one of the saws, as best you can.  Then remove any remaining rough edges or thin layers from the bone.  If, after aligning the bone, the patient experiences severe, harmful pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can realign it to its natural position, do so, as you will greatly benefit the patient.  Once the bone is completely set, soak a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it is summer, and do not place a bandage or anything oily on the wound.
So that mold and decay do not occur.  Then use splints when you are finished setting the bone. Leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole in the bandages around the wound with scissors.
Be extremely careful not to tighten the wound with the fracture.  Often, unskilled physicians do this, causing their patients either death, or ulcers or nasal discharge. Let your tightening be gentle and relaxed, unlike the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or large, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we described, and the patient experiences distressing pain in the area, you should not apply splints.  Instead, make bandages of strong cloth for the splint area and bind them tightly.
If, after a day or two, you see pus forming in the wound, remove the cloth soaked in the drink that you placed on it. Then use the dressings and ointments that are customary for treating wounds, such as the four-fold ointment, and so on. You should also loosen the bandage.
Examine the wound every evening and morning until it heals and is cured.  The limb should be positioned so that pus drains downward easily.  If the wound takes many days and does not close, or the pus does not cease, know that there are small fragments of bone.
Therefore, you should probe the wound with a probe. Remove any detached fragments. If any fragments remain unseparated, and are irritating the limb and causing pain, cut and remove them by any means possible.
If the wound develops a cold, or eating away, or another type of decay or putrefaction, you should counter each such symptom with similar treatment as described in its appropriate section.
If a large, prominent bone such as the femur or humerus, or similar large bone, is fractured, you should not attempt to pull or remove it. For often death results from this.  Leave it until it becomes putrid; perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see an area for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
On treating the complications that arise after some fractures.
This complication often arises after the fracture heals, especially if it is near the joints.  It spoils the appearance of the limb and may prevent the limb from performing its natural function.
If the complication is recent, use astringent remedies such as dates, frankincense, myrrh, gum arabic, and acacia—taking some or all of these, and mixing them with an astringent drink, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply this [mixture] to the complication with care, and bind it firmly. Leave the bandage for many days, then remove it and repeat [the application] until the complication subsides, God willing, or apply a tight lead plate to it.
Lead has the property of removing all that has accumulated in the tissues. If the complication has become hard, severe, and necessity dictates its removal, then cut it from above and remove or scrape off the excess tissue until it is gone. Treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In treating a fracture, if the limb, after being set, remains thin, unlike its original condition.
If a fractured bone is set and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this is due to many reasons. One reason is either excessive loosening and tying of the ligaments improperly, or excessive tightening of the ligaments so that nourishment cannot reach the limb; or excessive and excessive manipulation; or excessive movements at inappropriate times; or lack of blood in the patient's body and weakness.
Treatment for this involves nourishing the patient and enriching his body so that blood increases in it, using a bath, bringing joy and happiness to him, and similar measures.  Then apply pitch to the limb to draw much nourishment into it, or continuously manipulate it with lukewarm water. So that nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In treating fractured bones that have been rejoined crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
When a limb that has been set straight after healing shows crookedness, or a bulge in the broken bone, or a knot, and the limb's appearance is thus marred. However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, one should not accept the claim of those who assert that they can break the limb from the head; many ignorant physicians and setters of bones in our country do this.
This action is highly reprehensible, leading to considerable risk, potentially causing harm.  But if the crookedness and knotting are recent, it is appropriate to apply water in which relaxing herbs such as plantain leaves and root, and King's crown, and similar, have been boiled.
And apply relaxing dressings, such as well-made diachylon, or take the sap of the plantain root and mix it with chicken fat and sheep's fat and apply as a dressing, or take rich figs, grind them with pigeon droppings, and other similar medicines called resolvents.
And the knotting will dissolve with continuous gentle massage with the hands, moving the limb in every direction at all times.  However, if the bending is long-standing, severe, and has become hardened, and necessity dictates its treatment with iron.
Then it is necessary to split it open from above, to release the connection of the bone, and to cut away any excess knotting or bone with thin cuts.  Care and effort must be used in this process, then treat the wound as described previously until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is a dislocation of a joint from its position, hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing the afflicted severe pain and suffering.  Therefore, if someone suffers a dislocated jaw, one must immediately attempt to relocate it.
Do not delay at all; if delayed, the affected area will swell and form a mass, making relocation of the jaw difficult. Therefore, one should not delay, nor move nor stretch it while it is swollen, for it frequently causes painful spasms and suffering to the afflicted.
However, if this occurs, one should first bleed the afflicted person, then wait until the swelling subsides somewhat.  Then, apply warm water and ointment to the limb.  Then, gently relocate the jaw and treat each limb as described in its appropriate section.
The chapters on the jaw are also arranged according to what was previously discussed concerning fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.
Chapter twenty-four.
On treating the lower jaw.
The jaws dislocate rarely.  Their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they slightly shift from their position and relax slightly, or they completely dislocate and relax completely. The jaw, dislocated to the chest, causes the patient to drool and be unable to hold their saliva or close their jaw.  The tongue is unable to articulate speech.  If the dislocation is slight, it will often return to its position easily.
However, if the dislocation is complete, the jaw must be quickly repositioned and not delayed.  A servant should hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the patient's mouth if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
Or, if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, both thumbs should be inserted, and the other fingers of the hand should be used to align the jaw from the outside.  The physician instructs the patient to relax and release the jaw to move in every direction, and the physician aligns and pushes the jaw until it returns to its position.
If repositioning is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved, use warm water and ointments to make repositioning easier. Do not delay the repositioning, as stated before.  Once the jaws return to their proper position and the patient's mouth is closed and the jaws are not relaxed, then place linen bandages with a prepared mix of wax and rose ointment over them.
Then gently bind with a relaxed bandage. The patient should sleep on their back, with their head positioned between two pillows to prevent movement to the right or left, and should not be asked to chew anything.  His food should be soft and easily digestible.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is healed, let him eat whatever he desires.  Use gentleness, and do not force him to open his mouth for eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is completely healed.
If repositioning the jaws is difficult, and if they do not return to their correct positions at some point, fever, persistent headaches, and perhaps abdominal discomfort and repeated vomiting may occur.  If you observe this, know that it is a serious condition.
Often, one who experiences this condition dies within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On repositioning the collarbone and shoulder joint.
The collarbone, being attached to the chest on the inner side, does not usually dislocate inward.  However, it may dislocate outward, which is discernible by touch. To reduce the dislocation, the patient should lie on their back with their arms extended.
Then, press the area firmly with your hand, and it will return to its place.  After that, apply a bandage and splints, securing them tightly.  The part of the collarbone that extends to the shoulder and connects with it rarely dislocates. If it does, it should be repositioned as described above, to the extent possible.
Then apply a bandage, splints, and tight wraps.  Instruct the patient to remain still and quiet until healed.  This same treatment is used to reposition the shoulder joint if it is also displaced.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On reducing the dislocation of the shoulder.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one, towards the armpit and downward; two, towards the chest; and three, rarely, upwards and away from the shoulder.
It does not dislocate behind the shoulder blade nor in front of the nerve.  Most often, it dislocates downward toward the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, as it enters and exits quickly in such cases.
However, in those with much flesh, it is otherwise; that is, it exits and enters with difficulty.  Sometimes, a person may experience an injury or fall causing the shoulder to swell and become a hot, painful mass, which may be mistaken for a dislocation.  It is necessary to examine this thoroughly to ascertain the true state.
Then, in treating it, if the dislocation is downward towards the armpit, by comparing the dislocated shoulder with the healthy one, you will find a clear difference.  You will find a distortion in the head of the dislocated shoulder.  And beneath the armpit, the head of the dislocated shoulder feels like an egg upon palpation.
The afflicted person cannot raise their hand to their ear, nor move it through any range of motion.  Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, this will be evident to the touch, not hidden.
This dislocation may be easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is young. To reduce it, have an assistant raise the arm upwards. Then, place your thumbs under the armpit and forcibly lift the joint upwards to its proper place, while the assistant raises and extends the arm upward.
Then, lower it downwards, and it will return quickly. If it does not return by the method described above, and the dislocation has been present for several days, then the patient should bathe in hot water and use poultices that soften and relax, such as cooking the root of hyssop, fenugreek, and the herb crown of thorns in water and applying it.
Then, the patient lies on their back, and a ball of wool of moderate firmness is placed under their armpit.  Then, the physician places his heel on the ball, and takes hold of the patient's hand, extending it downwards.
And pushes the ball with his foot, and it will return to its place. Or, if you prefer, you may reduce it in this way: have a man taller than the patient stand on the side, and have him place his shoulder under the patient's armpit, lifting the armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. And another assistant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards their abdomen.  If the patient is light, then something else should be suspended from them to weigh them down, and then the dislocation will return immediately.  The dislocation may also be reduced in another way.
Another method is to place a long, round-headed piece of wood on the ground, like the pestle head of a mortar, neither thick nor thin.  Then, a soft cloth is placed on the top of the wood, and the patient is placed under the armpit, standing along the length of the wood.
Then, the patient extends their hand downwards from the other side, and also stretches their body forcefully from the other side.  Then the joint will quickly return to its place. If the dislocation is difficult to reduce by all the methods mentioned, then use this treatment: take a piece of wood about two cubits long. Its width should be about four fingers, and its thickness about two fingers.  It should have a round head, to easily enter the armpit in this manner:
Then, a soft cloth is tied to the round head to prevent the wood from hurting the patient.  The wood is then placed under the armpit, and the entire arm and forearm are extended along the wood downwards, and the wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then, the arm is placed on a transverse beam.  The hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side. The joint will then enter its place immediately. If it has entered in any way possible, a moderate-sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then, the prepared bandage, made of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white, is placed over the entire shoulder, wrapping around from above.  The ball is then tightly tied under the armpit, and the bandage is wrapped around it from above. The hand is suspended from his neck.
He should not move his hand for seven days.  The patient's diet should be kept light to strengthen the limb, which will hasten healing.  Then, after seven, or five days, the bandage is removed, and he is encouraged to move the limb. If it remains stable and does not relax, he is considered healed.
If the joint frequently dislocates due to moisture or another ailment, cauterization with three cauterizing agents should be used, as previously described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done, and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the joint still does not stabilize,
If the bandage and tightening are repeated multiple times and the joint still does not stabilize, dislocating and relaxing, and it cannot be raised upwards, know that the nerve at the top of the shoulder has been severed, stretched, or relaxed.  In that case, know that the joint will never stabilize in its proper position.
For the jaw, which is situated near the chest and breast, and behind it, reposition it by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to its place.  All other methods of tightening and treatment should be used until healing occurs.  If, after healing, there is stiffness in the limb and slowness in movement.
The patient should use a bath repeatedly until the stiffness softens and returns to its original state.
The twenty-seventh chapter.
On the treatment of the elbow joint.
The elbow joint is difficult to dislocate, and also difficult to relocate.  It dislocates in all directions, particularly forward or backward. Its dislocation is not hidden from you, as it is visible and palpable, whatever the form of the dislocation.
If you compare the dislocated elbow to the healthy one, its dislocation will be clearly evident due to the depression of the joint.  The arm cannot be bent, nor can the shoulder be touched.  You should act quickly to relocate the dislocation before a hot swelling develops.
If a hot swelling develops, it will be difficult to relocate it, and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backward.  This is the worst type of dislocation, the most painful, and often leads to death.
If it is possible to relocate it, a servant should extend his hand with both hands and outstretched arm, and the physician's hand should be positioned above and below the elbow, pushing the joint back into place with both thumbs or the base of his hands.
If the dislocation is forward, the arm may be bent once until the base of the hand strikes the corresponding shoulder. If the dislocation does not return, then employ very strong, forceful extension—two servants should extend the arm.
Two attendants also hold the patient to prevent displacement during extension.  Then the arm is rotated in each direction after wrapping a folded cloth or wide bandage around it.  If the physician works with both hands on the joint, applying ointment to smooth the joint's movement will make dislocating it easier.
Then the joint is pushed firmly until it returns.  After it returns, a bandage should be applied, containing a compress and drying agent with egg white, and the arm should be tightly bound and suspended from the patient's neck for several days.
Then it is released.  If the joint is fixed in place and the ligament has been released from it, leave it alone.  If you see that the joint is not firm, reapply the bandage and bandage and leave it for several days until it becomes firm, then release it. If any swelling occurs after the joint has returned and been released,
If movement is difficult, use moist heat in a bath, gentle massage and pressing until it softens, or place a fattened ram's horn on the joint, wrap it, and leave it for a day and a night, then remove it and put him in a bath.  If he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then repeat the horn application one, two, and three times with bathing until it softens. If you wish to use a dampened and thinned cow's hide with ghee, and bind it tightly, repeat this several times, as it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often dislocates and its reduction is easier than other joints, but it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the moment of dislocation, before the area becomes swollen or a hot swelling appears.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board and have an attendant extend the arm. The physician should place their hand on the prominence of the joint and push until it returns, however, it is necessary to observe if the dislocation has shifted to the palm of the hand.
Let the patient place the outside of their hand on the board during extension and reduction. If the dislocation is prominent on the outside of the hand, then let the inside of their hand be on the board, so the physician's hand rests on the same prominence of the joint. If it returns immediately, then do so, otherwise apply a bandage that soothes the swelling.
Leave it alone; do not attempt it again.  For it cannot be tolerated, and you cannot reduce it after days have passed, except that the joint will remain crooked and will not harm the patient, unless the hand weakens and cannot grasp anything.
At that point, you will know that the nerve is severed or injured, and there is no remedy except to apply cautery.  Perhaps it will help, perhaps it will not.  When the wrist is reduced, apply the bandage we described and then bind it tightly, leaving it for five days.
Then it is untied and the hand is exercised. If its movement is difficult and there is some stiffness, soften it with heated water and massage repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction.  When a finger dislocates to the palm's exterior or interior, extend the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumb until it returns to its place. Then tie the head of the finger and support it toward the direction to which it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it is straight on that day. If it is at night, tie it as described, and continue to loosen it during the day and exercise it with movement, and tie it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
And do the same if it dislocates to the palm's interior, tying it towards the same direction and performing your initial procedure until it heals.  Do likewise for any other direction of dislocation.
Chapter Thirty.
In treating the dislocation of the spine's vertebrae.
When a vertebra of the spine or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, for death rapidly approaches the afflicted person.
A sign of this is that the afflicted person's stool is expelled involuntarily; they cannot control it.  Often, some of their limbs—either their legs, or their arms, or one of them—become relaxed.  If only one vertebra is displaced, it often shifts.
Its displacement can occur in four directions. That which moves backward is called a hump.  If the hump has developed from childhood, there is no treatment for it, nor any cure.  However, if it resulted from a fall, blow, or similar cause...
The ancients described various treatments with lengthy explanations, much of which is of little benefit.  I have condensed this into a few key points, making it sufficient to encompass most of their approaches, clarifying the meaning and depicting the mechanism differently from their descriptions and explanations.
I say that a hump occurring in the front of the chest, and likewise those occurring to the sides, are incurable.  Only those occurring in the back are treated, as I will describe.  This involves placing the patient on their face.
On a level platform near a wall, spread a damp mat underneath to prevent injury to the chest.  Then place an upright plank, embedded in a hole in the ground, near the head end of the platform, and another plank near the feet at the other end of the platform.
A servant holds one plank, not fastened in the hole, and another servant holds the other plank in the same way. Then, a soft, strong bandage is wrapped around the patient's chest and under the armpits.  The end of the bandage is extended to the plank near the head and tied to it.
Then, another bandage is tightened over the hips, knees, and ankles.  All the bandages are gathered and tied to the other plank at the feet.  Each servant then pulls the plank to their side using the bandage, and the planks remain in their embedded positions.
However, the planks are not fastened, as we have said.  The physician places his hands firmly on the hump until it is straightened, or he places a board upon it and leans on the board with his legs until it straightens.  If this treatment is not successful, take a board about three cubits long.
A hole is made in the wall, near the patient, to accommodate the end of the board.  Then the middle of the board is placed on the hump, and the physician places his legs on the other end and pulls firmly to compress the hump.
It will return to its place.  If you wish, you can use a hand-twisted screw, by driving two planks, each one cubit long, into the ground at the patient's head and another two planks at the patient's feet, at the end of the shop.
Let there be a span between each plank. A hole is made in each plank for the screw to pass through.  All the planks are firmly fastened to the ground so they do not move.  A twisted stick, which is the screw, is inserted into the holes of the two planks, and the bandage is twisted in the holes.
At the end of the screw is a hole in which a stick a span long is fastened.  Similar arrangements are made in the other two planks.  Then the bandage tied to the patient's chest is tightened around the screw at his head, and the bandages tied to his legs are tightened around the screw at his feet.
Then a servant stands by each screw, twisting the screw with the twisting tool. The physician adjusts the hump as previously described. This is the image of the screw, the shop, and the patient.
Then, after the fracture returns to its place and the area is level, the dried dressing should be applied, using egg white, and then a bandage.  A splint made of a board, three fingers wide or so, and the length of the hump, should be placed over the bandage.
And over it some good beads, then bind with the appropriate bandage. The patient should use soft food until healed. If any protuberance remains in the area at the end of the healing, then the medications that loosen and soften should be used, along with the splint we described, for a long time.
A lead plate may also be used.  A protuberance might appear at the end of the back beads, and this may be mistaken for dislocation.  However, it could be an extra bone that has protruded; do not use this treatment for it, as death may result.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and are not subject to the slight displacement and displacement that occur in other joints. The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
This is because it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward.  It dislocates inward most often, and rarely forward or backward.  A sign of an inward dislocation is that if you place the sound leg of the afflicted person beside the affected leg, it will be longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the sound one, and the affected person will not be able to bend their leg at the hip. The area just below the hip will be swollen and noticeably inflamed, showing that the head of the thigh bone has moved there.
The signs of a dislocation outward will be the opposite of these signs.  A sign of a forward dislocation is that the leg is fully extended, but cannot be bent without pain, being in the knee.  If the person tries to walk, they cannot go forward.
Urine retention and swelling of the hip occur, and when walking, the person's weight is on the heel.  A sign of a backward dislocation is that the knee is not extended, and the person cannot bend the knee before bending the hip, and the leg is also shorter than the other.
The hip is relaxed, and the head of the thigh bone is clearly visible at the area of the waist.  However, to treat these types of dislocations, if it has been longstanding, if the person has not attempted to reduce it, and has remained in its condition, there is no cure at all.
Therefore, one should not allow this to happen. However, if the dislocation is recent and of any of the four types, immediately manipulate the joint by moving it in and out, and left and right.  Perhaps...
If it returns, no other treatment is necessary. If it does not return in this way, a strong, helpful assistant should hold the leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied above the knee, and another assistant should pull from above.
By placing his hands under the armpits, and then tightening a soft bandage around the root of the thigh, a third assistant holds the end of the bandage and pulls, either forward from the hip towards the collarbone, or backward towards the back.
All of them should pull at once, until the patient's body is raised from the ground and suspended. This type of pulling is common to all four types. If the dislocation returns as we have described, then otherwise, a specific treatment is required for each type.
If the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on their healthy side, and a bandage should be placed around the root of the thigh, between the head of the thigh and the area below the groin.
Then, the bandage is pulled upward from the groin towards the upper body and the collarbone.  A strong assistant then takes hold of the thick part of the affected thigh with both arms and pulls it forcefully outward, which will return it to its place.
This type is easier than other methods of returning this limb. If this type of treatment is unsuccessful, then the patient's legs should be bound with a strong, soft bandage around the heels and knees.
Each bandage should be approximately four fingers apart. The affected leg should be extended further than the other by two fingers. Then, the patient should be suspended from the head using a piece of wood in the house, with the feet at a distance of two arms from the ground.
Then, a strong boy should grasp the head of the thigh, and another boy should hold the patient and push the first boy forcefully, causing the joint to return to its proper place quickly.  As for its specific return, if the dislocation is outward...
The patient should lie on the mat, as described for the case of a hump.  A bandage should be tightly applied to the affected leg and the chest.  Then, two pieces of wood should be placed, one at the patient's feet and the other at their head, and an additional, strongly secured piece of wood placed in the middle of the mat.
Damp cloths should be wrapped around it to prevent injury to the patient. The board should be placed between the patient's thighs to prevent downward displacement during the extension. Then, each attendant should pull in their direction, and the physician should adjust the hip with their hands.  If it returns to place...
Otherwise, place the board on it and apply pressure as described for the hump, except that the patient should lie on their healthy side. If the dislocation is forward, the patient's leg should be extended once in this exact position on the mat.
The physician places the palm of their right hand on the affected hip and presses it with the other hand.  The pressure should be extended downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be extended downwards.
It should be elevated above the ground, but placed on a firm surface, and the hip should be turned outwards, as described in its position on the mat on its face, with the bandages tight.
As we said before, pressure should also be applied to the board on the area where the joint has dislocated.  When the hip joint has returned correctly, a sign will be apparent, which is the extension of the patient's leg.
If you see them level and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned correctly.  Then join the thighs, apply the bandage, and secure it with a bandage that prevents any movement of the hip.
The patient must remain still for three or four days, then the bandage should be removed and the leg should be compared to the other. If you see them equal in size, know that the joint has set, and allow the patient to walk. If you see any relaxation in the joint, however,
Return and bandage it, tightening it as you did initially. Leave it for three more days.  Then remove the bandage, and let the patient walk slowly for several days until the joint strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On the treatment of the knee joint.
The knee joint dislocates in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (i.e., backward).  It does not dislocate forward.  A sign of dislocation is to instruct the patient to bring the leg close to the thigh.
If the leg does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated.  To reduce all types of dislocations, the patient should sit down, extending their legs if able.  A servant should sit behind the patient, holding the patient's torso and gently twisting it backward.  Then you should sit on the patient's thighs.
Place your back to the patient's face, and position their leg between your legs.  Then grasp the knee with both hands, interlacing your fingers around it.  Press firmly with both hands on the sides of the knee.  A second attendant should extend the patient's leg, until the knee returns to its place.
A sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh without force, then bandage it and secure the leg to the thigh. Bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release it.  Only allow minimal walking for several days until strength returns.
If the reduction described above proves impossible, use strong traction with the bandages previously described for hip treatment until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-three.
On the treatment of ankle fracture.
The ankle may dislocate slightly or completely.  Dislocation can be inward or outward. A sign of dislocation is that the ankle will appear swollen and prominent on the side to which it has dislocated.
As for treating a simple dislocation, gentle manual traction and realignment will suffice for its reduction.  However, if the dislocation is complete, the patient should sit down while a strong, capable attendant holds the patient firmly from behind at the middle of their back.
Then, with your right hand grasping the foot from above and your left hand from below at the heel, pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand, twice. Then extend the foot with your left hand and push the front of the foot towards the leg with your right hand, without force.
Repeat this process twice as described.  Then, on the third time, push the front of the foot towards the leg while pulling at the heel.  If the foot returns to its proper position in one or two repetitions like this and you see the foot is aligned, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If the foot does not return with the methods described, then lay the patient on their back on the ground.  Drive a very firmly secured peg into the ground, positioned between the patient's thighs.  Wrap cloth around it to prevent injury to the patient.  Then the attendant should hold firmly on the patient's thigh.
Then a second attendant stretches the leg, either by hand or with a bandage tied around the patient's thigh.  Each attendant pulls in the opposite direction, and the peg remains positioned between the patient's thighs, holding them so that the patient's body does not move downwards during the stretching.  Then the physician aligns the joint (or fracture) with their hands.
Another attendant holds the healthy leg downwards.  If the joint returns quickly, then take the bandage and splint, and secure it firmly with bandages. Tie the foot down with bandages to the lower leg.  Care must be taken to avoid the nerve located behind the heel.
So that the bandage is not too tight and causes him pain.  Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it again.  Then release it on the third or fourth day.  The patient should avoid walking for forty days.
If the patient attempts to walk before this time, there is a risk that the joint will dislocate and not heal.  Treatment will then be unsuccessful.  If a hot swelling appears, then use the treatments described previously for other inflammations and swellings until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On treating the dislocated toes.
The dislocated bones should be gently aligned with a slight stretch, without force. This is not difficult but easy. If the dislocation is in one of the toes on the top of the foot, the patient should place their foot on a flat surface.
Or on a board while standing, like a walker. Then you should place your foot on the protruding joint and press down firmly on it with your foot until it returns to its proper alignment and there is no longer a protrusion.
Then place a board under the sole of their foot, covering the entire foot, which should have two ends.  Tie it tightly for three days, then loosen it and keep them from walking for several days until it strengthens and a return is avoided, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation that occur with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both.
When something like this occurs and you attempt treatment and reduction, it is often followed by death.
Therefore, one should not undertake such treatment unless one is skilled in the craft, experienced, gentle, compassionate, careful, and not rash or reckless.  In the beginning, one should use only medications that soothe hot swellings, and leave the patient be.
By God's will, except where you hope for the patient's safety from harm with mild illness, and some hope appears for it, then return it [the remedy] from the very beginning before a hot swelling occurs.
If the member returns to the desired state, then use the treatment that soothes hot swellings and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments. If the dislocation is with a fracture and fragments have detached from the bone, then remove them. Follow in this regard what we have mentioned concerning simple ailments in the preceding sections.
Strive diligently and purify yourself from entering the path of risk, as previously advised.  That will be more enduring for your reputation and safer for your standing, God willing.
