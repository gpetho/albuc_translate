Chapter Forty-Three:
On the cauterization at the beginning of hump formation.
This disease often occurs in young children; the sign of its onset in children is a swelling and movement on their back.
You will find that the last vertebra of the back and its surrounding areas start to rise above the other vertebrae.
And when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery in this manner:
That the cautery covers the entire area of the vertebra equally.
And if you want, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two or three lines.
And the points should be close to each other.
Then treat the area until it heals with what we have mentioned.
But be careful not to use cauterization on humps caused by nerve spasms.
