When someone has tremors due to cold in the nerves, or from a fever caused by cold, or other similar causes, then cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, placing one cautery between each vertebra; and one on the chest, and one on the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery.	When someone has a tremor, either from chill in a nerve or quartan fever, or from some other cause, you should cauterize him four or five times over the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra, and one on his breast and one on his stomach, with an olivary cautery.	0.8995608
This will calm the tremor and hasten the healing of the cold-induced illness.	Thus the tremor will be stilled and the dispersal of the cold distemper will be hastened.	0.74144906
