It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay pulling it as long as you can, for one should not do this; for it is a very important substance until one has no excuse to scrape it.
Then when the patient is compelled to have it extracted, you must be certain of the aching tooth.
Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and has the good tooth pulled; and yet the pain does not leave because of that, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this done to these lords; and when you are quite certain of the aching tooth, then you must scrape around the tooth with a strong spatula to protect the gums on all sides; then loosen it with your fingers or with fine tongs at first, little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly grasp it with the tongs; and let the patient's head be in your lap between your knees, and hold him well so that he does not move. 
Then extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it will not come out, then take one of these instruments and insert it gently on each side, and move it as you did before. 
And if the tooth is perforated and decayed, you must fill it with cloth, there where the holes are; and grasp it delicately with the tongs, so that it does not break upon extraction; and it is necessary to work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And take good care that you do not break it, and a piece remains, and the patient suffers even greater pain than the first due to the harmful root.
And beware not to do as the ignorant healers do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the jaw, and do not employ what we have described; but sometimes cause, because of this, great illness due to the roots that remain, or because of the jaw that they break, as we have often seen; and when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and salt; and if bleeding occurs there, which often happens, fill the area with ground vitriol; and if that is not effective, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, with which one moves the teeth first, should be with long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you pull the tooth; and these are the shapes:
And they should be of thick parts so that they do not bend upon pulling, and be of well-made Indian steel, and be toothed to hold firmly.
