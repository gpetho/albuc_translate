Of the diseases of the bladder
When abrasions or blood occur in the bladder, or decay is present, and you want to distill water and medicines there, do so with the instrument called "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three holes: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see; and the place at the top where the medicine flows should be such that it stops the penis without addition, so that the moisture can be drawn out, and pushed in when needed;
and when you want to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the kesteur in the moisture, and pull the plunger that is inside; this will draw the moisture into the kesteur, and then push the plunger back in forcefully; the moisture will enter, and come to the bladder immediately, so the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the fine clyster with which one irrigates the bladder: it is here:
It is made of silver or brass, and the top is higher; and below has a base where the ties fall; then take a sheepâ€™s bladder and put the moisture with which you want to irrigate the bladder into it, then tie it between the two bases with a good double thread, and warm the moisture a little over the fire; then insert the head of the clyster into the penis, then press your hand on the bladder with the moisture accordingly, until the patient feels that the moisture has come into the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle, and pierce it roundly around; then put a strong thread through these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put into it what you want of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument; and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture comes to the bladder.
