On Incising the Disease Known as al-Nafir (The Fleeing).	On incision for the disease known as 'flitting disease'.	0.68624294
This disease, which is called al-nafir (the fleeing) in our country, is a pain that occurs in some of the organs, then moves from organ to organ, and I have seen it as I describe it to you.	The disease known in our region as 'the flitting disease' is a pain arising in a limb and then passing from limb to limb.	0.6902013
I was called to a sick woman in a rural area, and she uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the arm's tendon. When I remained for an hour, I saw that swelling creeping along the forearm as a worm creeps, rising to her shoulder blade as quickly as could be, like mercury.	I have personally seen it as I shall describe to you: I was called to a woman patient in a country district, who uncovered her arm and showed me a small inflation of the cephalic vein. After I had waited a while I saw the swelling creep like a worm along the forearm, ascending towards her shoulder, with the greatest possible speed, as of quicksilver running from place to place.	0.85873914
If it flowed from one place to another, the pain would disappear from that place and settle in the shoulder blade.  Then I sat for an hour, and it ran throughout her body until it was in the other arm. Then she told me that it circulated throughout her whole body, just as I had witnessed.	Then the pain left that place and settled in the elbow. Then I waited a while and the pain ran through the whole body until it reached the other arm. Then she related to me that it used to pass all round her body as I had seen it.	0.8346202
I marveled at the speed of its transfer from one organ to another, and I had not previously seen this disease with my own eyes in this way, except that I had seen a group of people who found the pain moving from one organ to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.	I was amazed at the speed with which it migrated from one part to another, as I had never before seen this disease in this form, though I had seen many who had a pain that passed from limb to limb; but never with my own eyes had I seen anything like what I saw in this woman.	0.90216076
And I did not consider that to be anything other than because the woman was from the rural people, dry of body, with exposed veins, and therefore this moving wind appeared to the senses. And it must be that it does not appear to this degree in people of luxury and moist bodies with hidden veins.	The only opinion I could form of it was that it was due to the woman's being of the dwellers in the wilds, dry of body, with outstanding veins, and hence that moving vapour was perceptible. But it follows then that it does not appear in that manner in people leading a leisured life, with humid bodies and hidden veins.	0.8425552
If you want to treat it, and its possessor feels the pain, then if it appears to you visually, as we mentioned, quickly tie above and below it and incise over it until that trapped wind comes out, and cauterize the place.	When you want to cure this, and the patient feels the pain of it, and if you observe the appearance we have described, then tie a bandage round above and beneath it as quickly as possible and cut down on it so that the vapour enclosed there may come out; and cauterize the place.	0.8690543
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it by shaking the body and with what expels and dissipates the winds, such as asafoetida, sagapenum, and similar medications.	But if there is nothing visible to you then treat by purging of the body and by medicines dispelling and getting rid of flatus, such as foetid pills and pills of sagapenon and the like.	0.7472141
