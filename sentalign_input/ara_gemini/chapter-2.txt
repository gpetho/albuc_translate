The second chapter on incision, lancing, phlebotomy, wounds, and the like.
Khalaf said: We have mentioned in the first chapter every disease suitable for cauterization with fire and burning medicine, its causes and reasons, its instruments, and forms of cauteries, and I have made that into chapters from the head to the foot.
And I follow in this chapter the same path to make it easy for the student to obtain what he seeks.
And before I begin with that, it is necessary for you to know, my sons, that this chapter contains more danger than the first chapter on cauterization, and for that reason, the warning in it should be stronger, because the work in this chapter often involves the discharge of blood, by which life is sustained, when opening a vein, or incising a swelling, or lancing an abscess, or treating a wound, or extracting an arrow, or incising a stone, and similar things, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most of them, death occurs.
And I advise you against falling into what is doubtful for you, for various types of people may come to you in this profession with various kinds of illnesses, and among them are those who have become weary of their illness, and death has become insignificant to them due to the intensity of their suffering and the length of their affliction, and the illness has reached a stage that indicates death.
And among them are those who offer you their wealth and enrich you with it, hoping for health, but their illness is fatal, so it is not appropriate for you to help anyone who comes to you with such a condition at all, and let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with anything of that until after certain knowledge is established with you regarding the good outcome it will lead to.
And use in all the treatment of your patients the precedence of knowledge and warning about what the safety will lead to, for in that, you will have help in acquiring praise, glory, remembrance, and thanks.
May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and may He not deprive you of correctness and success. Indeed, that is in His hand, there is no god but Him.
And I have arranged this chapter into sections, as presented in the chapter on cauterization, from the head to the foot, to make it easier for you to obtain what you want from it, God willing.
