Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed for you O Sons the book which is the ultimate science in medicine with its complement and having reached the end of it from its expositions and declarations, it appeared to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of practical application, that is surgery using hands.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgical practice with the hand has been neglected in our region and our time: until perhaps its science perishes and its trace is completely cut off; and there remains of it nothing but small descriptions in ancient books which have been distorted by later hands, and upon which error and hesitation occur, until its intentions are obscured and its vision prolonged - It seemed to me that I should revive it with the ordering of this Treatise on surgical practice according to the way of exposition, declaration and abbreviation; and so that I may come to know the forms of cautery instruments and other tools of surgery by means of addition in their description and of their necessary preparation.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good practitioner of this surgery with his own hand is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy which Galen described until he knows the structures of members and their forms, and how they are joined together or separated; and has knowledge of bones and nerves and muscles and their numbers, and knows how they move, and of veins - both those that pulse and those at rest - and where they emerge.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for this reason Hippocrates said that a name is great with a name, but small with a deed, and especially in the art of hand surgery.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have indeed said this about it in the introduction to this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For those who are not knowledgeable about what we have said regarding anatomy, they will not be cleared of error, in which people are killed; as I myself have witnessed many among them who are trained in this science and boast of it without knowledge or experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened is because I saw a foolish physician cut a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck and he severed some arteries in her neck; thus the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I witnessed another physician who presumed to extract a stone from an aged man and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	It therefore reached him, and he extracted it with a fragment of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Thus the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed I had already been called to extract it; and upon seeing the size of the stone, and considering the patient's condition, I knew that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I witnessed another physician who was taking a fee from one of the Dukes of our land for his services; and it so happened that a black eunuch, who belonged to him, suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the doctor hastened with his ignorance and bound up the fracture over the wound with plasters and tight bandages, and he did not allow any release for the injury.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he let him go after a few days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage; and he remained like that until an abscess formed on his leg and foot, and it resulted in his ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called upon and hurried to release the ligament; thus tranquility ensued, and he escaped his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the deformity had already set in firmly on his limb; I was unable to rectify it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	He consequently ceased walking due to the deformity on his limb until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician, who pierced an abscess filled with cancerous matter; it became ulcerated after a few days until its malignancy was magnified before its owner's eyes.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	This is because when cancer is pure and comes from a melancholy humour, it ought not to be approached with the iron at all unless it is on a limb that can tolerate having its entirety cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for this reason, my sons, you must know that surgical work is divided into two branches: namely, operations which are associated with a cure; and operations where there is risk in numerous situations.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already aroused you everywhere in this book to where the operation involves dread and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	It is necessary for you to beware of that and avoid it so that the unlearned do not find a way to speak about it and bring dishonour upon it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore take the measure with care and protection and your patients with ease and firmness; and go by a better way, leading to healing and laudable succession through God's grace; and abandon those dire diseases which are hard to cure; and remove from yourselves what makes you afraid so that hesitation does not come upon you in faith and gain.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	It is indeed more conducive to your glory, and loftier in this world, and ultimately to your status.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen has indeed said as much in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat an evil disease, lest you be called bad doctors.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have now divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On cauterization with fire and with sharp instruments, systematic and ordered from head to toe, the shapes of the instruments and tools used for cauterization, and everything that is necessary for such operations.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On cutting and piercing, bloodletting and boils, wounds; on extracting arrows and the like; likewise ordered and systematic regarding the shapes of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration and dislocations, curing twists and the like; likewise ordered from head to toe and systematic regarding the shapes of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Al-Zahrawi (Albucasis).
Pars I.	Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the harm of cauterization; on which constitutions it suits, and when; whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before recalling the operations with it, one should speak of its qualities and harms; on which constitutions it is to be used.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say, therefore, that a discourse on the quality of cauterization and its harmful effects is an extensive, subtle matter, a science, and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	A multitude of wise men also spoke on it, and they disagreed among themselves; for me, a little from their discourses suffices, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say, therefore, that cauterization universally suits all constitutions, whether with or without material; except for two constitutions, which are the hot constitution without material and the dry constitution without material.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, they disagreed about the hot and dry constitutions with material.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some said that cauterization is beneficial for them.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for an illness arising from heat and dryness; since the nature of fire is heat, it is unsuitable to heal a hot and dry illness with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who said the opposite stated: cauterization benefits all hot and dry illnesses that occur in human bodies; for when you compare a human body and its humors to the constitution of fire, you find the human body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I say, from his discourse: because experience has already proven this to me several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, one should not attempt it unless he is already proven and practiced in the last chapter's exercise on cauterization practice, and has knowledge of the variety of human constitutions and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, their causes, incidents, and duration.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Among other body types, there is no need for concern; especially with cold and damp illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have indeed agreed upon them; and they do not dissent on the usefulness of cauterization for these.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, my children, that from the secret of cure by cauterization with fire, its goodness is superior to that of cauterization with burning medicine; for fire is simple, whose action does not reach unless to the member which is cauterized: and it harms no other member joined to it, save for a small injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which extends from the members: and perhaps it causes to happen in the member a difficult-to-heal illness, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	It has already become apparent to us through experimentation, due to the length of our service and study with this art, and our standing on the truth of things: and I am absolved from the length of my speech because of that.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not for the fact that it is not permitted to reveal in this my book the hidden secret of fire and the quality of its operation in bodies by means of expelling illnesses, which it demonstrates with philosophical reasoning that would sharpen your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, my children, that they themselves disagree on the timing, at which it is appropriate to perform a cauterization, and place greater value on the proper time with truthful reasoning.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that a cauterization is appropriate at any time: for this reason, that the harm of an accident due to timing is submerged in the benefit which is drawn with cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if cauterization is done because of pains arising from necessary injuries, strong and severe ones that do not tolerate delay: for this reason, there is a fear that the worse harm will occur rather than a minor injury caused by delaying treatment.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it occur to your minds, o sons, that which only the laymen and foolish physicians do not consider, namely that for illnesses which are healed by cauterization there is not always a relapse: they regard this as its consequence but it is not so; for cauterization serves no purpose other than in place of medicine, altering the body's constitution and drying up the moist humours which cause pain.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization surpasses medicine because of the speed with which it heals, and its powerful mode of operation, and the intensity of its control; and it is possible that there may be a relapse after some time according to the patient's constitution, and the location of their illness, as well as its severity, and what has been prepared in their body from an excess of humours within them, or what has reached them through acquisition from food, or similar causes unless they fall ill with something which requires cauterization.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a limb which is caused by an excess of humours and moistness, such as the cauterization of a tooth due to pain, or similar cases may not relapse.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this occurs in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	However, the layman's saying that cauterization is medicine's last resort is correct, but not as they intend it; for they believe there to be no cure which can match medicine or any other treatment once cauterization has been applied.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, the reality is the opposite of that, and the intent, which is that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, it is not so unless when we apply methods of treatment for some illnesses and those medications are ineffective; then we perform cauterization as a last resort, and it works: from this comes the saying, 'cauterization is the last resort in medicine,' but not according to the intent that the general public and many foolish doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the loftiness of its substance; and they said that the site of cauterization does not produce pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely true, for I have already proven it and found that it does not do so in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with gold is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you heat the cautery over fire made from gold, it does not indicate to you when it has been heated according to the amount that you desire due to the redness of the gold; and when it quickly becomes cold, and if you add more ignition to it, it melts in the fire and turns into flakes.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	That is why the artisan falls short with it for the task; and because of this, cauterization with iron among us is faster and more immediate in terms of preparedness to perform the procedure.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I indeed have already arranged this chapter on cauterization according to topics, and I have arranged it from head to toe so as to facilitate the search for whoever wants something from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	The manner of cauterizing the head is at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Head, second degree.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization is applicable to the dominance of moisture and coldness over the brain: which are two causes of headaches, and the multitude of fluid flowing from the head towards the eyes and ears, and the abundance of sleepiness, toothache, and throat pain: and universally for all illnesses that occur due to coldness, such as paralysis, fainting, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is to instruct the patient to first evacuate their head with a cleansing, dissolving medicine for three nights or four, according to how strong the patient is, and his age, and what he is used to.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to scrape his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands in the shape of a square so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that place with the cautery.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then fire the olive oil cautery, which is of this form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it over the marked spot with the cautery, pressing down in a manner that your hand becomes constricted gradually, and you roll it around.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then remove your hand quickly, and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that an amount of bone the size of a chickpea or the size of a stinging nettle has already been burnt away, then lift your hand up.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	If not, repeat with your hand using the same iron, or another one if this one has cooled down: until you see the bones I mentioned to you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak the dressing in it, and place it on the wound: leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the soaked dressing on butter, and leave it on until the fire-wound scab is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the four-herb ointment until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They already said that the more a wound remains open, the more it discharges pus: which is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said to cauterise the skin down to the bone: and hold the cautery there until something thick from the bone burns.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape after what has been burnt of the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that one must reach with the cautery to the end, until it leaves an impression on the bone like a seal stamp: or a tool that women use for putting small letters; and they believe that vapours of the head will escape from this place, and the wound should be left open for long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it until it becomes solid.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But to me, these two types of cauterisation seem suitable only for some people with a tendency towards fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And letting it be, in my view, is better for their health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head becomes weak due to the dissolution of its inherent continuity; as we have witnessed in other body parts; especially when by nature an ill person's head is frail; and I find the first type of cauterization safer and better, so I use it; therefore work with it for healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the method of cauterizing the head in cases of total headache.
Caput III.	Head: Three.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a prolonged chronic pain occurs all over the head; and it is treated with herbs, leeches, clysters, oils, and embrocations.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized once with the type we described and none of those treatments help; then consider this.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the patient's head is of a strong build by nature and not weak, but feels excessive cold; then cauterize it with another type of cautery underneath to a lesser degree.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over the entire horn of its head with a cautery that does not penetrate through the skin and reveals an amount of bone as we described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with one type on the occipital bone of its head, in a place called vas, which is where the windpipe is located; and raise your hand here, and do not reveal the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the patient feels a severe pain from it, different from the pains of all other types of cauterization of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this the Cautery of its Place; and it should be a cautery that is finer than the one used to cauterize the horns of the head and its occipital bone when cauterizing its centre.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cauterization for hemicrania, both with burning medicine and with an iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When there is pain and swelling on the head, or when the pain extends to the eye, and it is evacuated with cleansing medicines for the head, and the rest of the treatment that I mentioned in the sections on diseases does not help completely; then cauterization of this condition should be done in two ways: either by cauterization with burning medicine, or with an iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	Cauterization with burning medicine is done by taking one alum, scraping it and cutting off its ends on both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the painful spot at an opportune time with a broad lancet until there is made in it beneath the skin a place into which the tooth can be fitted.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Insert it into the skin so that it is hidden; then bind over it with a compress of suitable tightness and leave it for fifteen hours; then release it, take out the tooth, and allow the wound to rest two or three days. Afterwards, apply to it, an ointment soaked in butter until the spot forms pus; afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do it with some burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on caustic medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization with an iron is done in this way.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	With the cautery fire whose form is thus:
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	The clavicle is so named because the shape of its head is like that of a nail, which has a certain curvature, and in its middle there is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the site and hold your hand; you roll the blade gradually with speed, and let the amount that is cauterized by its thickness be like half of (the skin).
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Raise your hand so that the artery below is not cauterized, for a bleeding will occur.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a compress in salt water and place it on the site for three days; then apply a compress with butter; afterward treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this temple with the second knife-like extremity of the Cauterium.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting an artery in this temple, not one that is old.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing an old temple.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When treating a temple with what we have said from the previous treatment and what we mentioned in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not work; and you see that it is insufficient for the illness what we previously stated about cauterizing with medicine or cauterization by fire, then it is necessary to use the knife-like Cauterium until it whitens after you mark on the site of pain a line whose length is half a finger, or something like that; and remove your hand once, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, you must be careful to avoid the continuation of the jawbone, which moves during chewing, lest the side or the nerve that moves it be burned, causing a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And remain above the cost, and take care of the arterial blood flow, which has been cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	Indeed, its cutting off is feared, and especially by him who does not know what he is doing and is neither studious nor experienced; and he abandons the operation with him first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with the recollection of the treatment for accidental arterial blood flow according to its manner and in this book's place.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the illness that it is not sufficient for him with this cautery, and you see the patient's body tolerate the cautery in the middle of the head, as we described, treat the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cautery that we said in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	This cautery is better and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterizing for ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with solutions and other treatments we mentioned before, but the pain does not go away, then cautery by fire; this is called a puncture whose form is as follows...
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then puncture with it all around the ear as it revolves; or all around each one if pain is present in both simultaneously.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And extend yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear for a short while, after you have marked the places with the encaustrum; and let the amount of cauterization be ten points in every ear, and so on.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	The way of cauterization in Torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The torture which is cured by means of cautery is only of that kind which happens through the phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And turn aside the cautery from that kind which happens through drying out and a nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this kind of torture with ipecacuanha, emetics, and gargles but your treatment does not work then it is necessary that you cauterize the sick person three times; once at the root of the ear, and a second time just below the tympanum, and thirdly where the two lips meet.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the sick part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur unless it happens on that part which appears to be healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of the cautery is such that you cauterize with a cautery the upper end of the ear under the horn of the head slightly, and another on the tympanum; whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And leave your hand with the cautery until half of its thickness has been burnt.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	This is the form of a cautery, and it is made from a lancet with the aforementioned shape; however, it should not be too delicate, as you can see, and there must be a little superfluous thickness to the blade.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound as described previously until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	The method of cauterising an old stroke.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When an old stroke is treated and you have taken care of it as described but your treatment does not work, and the patient has no fever, then cauterise them with four cauteries on each corner of their head, one in the middle of the head, and another at the back of the head, as explained previously; apply cautery according to the method outlined above.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	The stomach bone is also treated with cautery, which is generally the final step in treatment.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Afterwards it should be treated as previously described.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	The method of cauterising amnesia.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	The patient must first be given fresh drinks and pills to cleanse the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Next, shave the patient's head completely and apply to their occipital bone a plaster of mustard seed as described in the section on plasters; repeat this several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is the method of cautery; apply it as previously described with the same order.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If they heal through this method, then that is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make three cauterizations on the back of their head, which are descending from the top of the head down to the bottom part of the eye; and leave a finger's width between each cautery.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cauterization, along with what has preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish to add more and the patient is able to tolerate it: then make a cauterization on the middle of the area.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish to add more, then cauterize it above two corners.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat it until it is healed; let the cauterization be anointed with oil according to the form which has been described before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	A paragraph on the method of cauterization for paralysis and softening.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed with the cleansing of the head with hyssop, and with what we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the patient's head; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery on the middle of their head, and a cautery above each corner of their head, and a cautery behind them, and three over the vertebrae of their neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you need to soften the patient's body with more cauteries, and they are able to tolerate it, and their illness is severe: then cauterize them with four cauteries over the vertebrae of their back, and the last one with a cautery until most of its surface blisters out of their skin, and lift your hand upwards.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then treat it until it is healed; anoint the cauterization with oil thusly.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	The method of cauterization for epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized unless their epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, it is necessary that you first clean their brain with hyoscyamus, and with the rest of the treatment we described in the division: when the patient is strong or tolerant to accepting medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then give them mouthwashes and chewing cleansers for the brain, before that on many days with good food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, then cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, as preceded in the method: and another on his occipital bone, and over every horn of his head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize them with the cauteries that I mentioned for one having paralysis, and a softening of the body over the cervical vertebrae and dorsal vertebrae: and let the cautery be olive oil according to the method which preceded.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	But if the patient is a child, then place a fine cautery, according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	The method of cauterization for melancholia.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the cause of melancholia is corrupted moistures, and thick phlegm, then cauterize them with the cauteries that we mentioned for one having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholia is an excess of black bile towards melancholia, and the patient's body is moist, then give them to drink what cleanses their brain, as preceded in the division: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a decently made linen cap like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it on the middle of the head: and let the patient sit square and be held from every part.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present the ointment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is more worthy from old egg butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And warm it over the fire with tempered heat to the extent that a finger could bear when inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate it onto the middle of their head in a circle, and leave it until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this for the patient once every week with the rest of their good regimen until they are healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterise it by making many small holes in it, except for what you hold with your hand holding the cauterising iron: and let [the patient] be fasting.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this type of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then place over it a poultice soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	A way of cauterising that descends to the eye in water.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When you ascertain that water is coming from the eye through the signs I mentioned above, then begin and make the patient drink with something that will clean their head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And protect them from all moisture, and make them sit in the bath, fasting for a few days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then instruct them to shave their head, and cauterise it on the middle of their head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it over the two temples with two cauteries if there is an onset of watery discharge from both eyes simultaneously, or from one side if there is watery discharge from one eye; and cut through all veins and arteries that are under the skin with the cautery; and let the cauteries be as long as the width of the temples: and beware of a flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything coming out of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with wisdom regarding the extraction and cutting of arteries, and caution against a flow of blood.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under two bones, with two extremely hot cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	The method of cauterizing for excessive weeping.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old and persistent, and they appear over veins and arteries that are visible on the exterior of the head, it is confirmed that this is due to an excess of cold and phlegmatic humours; then cauterize with a single cautery as I have described for the onset of watery discharge, with one cautery in the middle of the head, two cauteries over the temples, and two cauteries on the neck under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you require additional treatment, then cauterize it on every side of the eye with caution, at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	The method of cauterizing for nasal odour.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with what we have described for the division of treatments, and treatment is not forthcoming; then proceed swiftly, and give him a decoction made from crushed garlic in broth three times at night: thereafter shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized searing iron heated with oil.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with two clavicle-shaped cauteries, above the eyebrows slightly beneath the hairline.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And guard against the artery, lest you cut it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the shape of the clavicle cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	On the method of cauterizing a softened eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of an eye softens due to disease or moisture, then you should cauterize the softened part with one cautery, using this lunar cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on each side; let them extend beyond the temples by a little bit and make every cautery of the same length as the eyelid; do not remove your hand holding the cautery until one-third of the eyelid has been burned.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the shape of the cautery for this lunar method of cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing an eyelid with reversed eyelashes that irritate the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery in this case is of two kinds; either a fire-cautery or a caustic-medicine cautery.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	For the fire-cautery, instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hair if he is one of those who cleanses himself by shaving until it grows out and becomes even in length.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, they irritate him at the root, then bind his eyes with a cloth so that they do not move until new eyelashes grow in their place.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are born and equalized, then place the patient's head in your lap; next, mark above the eyelids of his eyes with cautery, a mark that is shaped like a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the eyelashes.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place over the eye a poultice soaked in egg white; or use a mucilage of psyllium.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply fire with the following instrument.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize gradually over the shape you marked with many touches of the iron, until the skin surface which appears just like a myrtle leaf is completely burned away.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And you will know your work is healthy when you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting, and the eyelashes rising at the wound of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore lift your hand then; and let him go after three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place over the patient a poultice with butter until the scar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with an ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any of the eyelashes grow back after this time and the eyelid becomes soft again; then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	However if the eyelashes are on the lower lid; then cauterize it until it is lifted to its normal place and equalized so that the lashes do not poke the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the way of cauterizing with caustic medicine in this case:
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	Advise the patient to leave the hairs [after an operation], until they grow back and become even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a piece of cloth in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Take an ounce of known soap and the same amount of un-soaked lime; then grind them together well, and do this quickly so that it doesn't get cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread some of it on the piece of paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over one or both eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	Place a soaked poultice, dipped in egg white, under the eye; and let the patient's head rest on your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	Put your index finger on the medicine and press it gently.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And move your finger whenever the patient feels a stinging sensation from the medicine; for its sting is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While you persist with this which the patient finds stinging, then stop applying the medicine and move it away with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the stinging sensation subsides, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	Then observe if you see the eyelid swelling like it does when exposed to fire or cut; and if not, then repeat on it some medicine in an area where the medicine hasn't yet been applied and isn't discoloured, until your procedure is even and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place on it a poultice with butter until the burnt skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Treat it then with diaphanicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And during the procedure, you must take care to protect the patient's last barrier [i.e., eye], lest any of the medicine falls into it.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after a few days and something irritates the eye from the eyelashes, then repeat the medicine on that place which is softened by its own eyelid, as you did initially.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And you should be aware that human eyes vary in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be thus: the path of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a zeal for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the method of cauterizing a tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a tear duct fistula with what we said in the divisions of ailments, and your treatment does not bear fruit, then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the patient to place their head in your lap and have an assistant hold their head between their hands so that it cannot move or be shaken.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Next, place a sponge soaked in alum, or in psyllium mucilage on their eye; then take up the cautery with this shape.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	It should be hollow like the shape of an eagle-feather quill at one end, with which the cautery is done; and if you want it to penetrate all the way through to the other end, or upwards, then temper it thus.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	Indeed this bowl is better for your purpose.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Next squeeze the abscess, if it is open, and extract its foul matter, then dry it out; but if it isn't open, then you must open it, and extract its puss.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place over it the hot cautery iron.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand for a moment over the cautery iron from beyond the eye, towards the nose, so that you don't miss with your hand nor disturb the patient; then place the hot iron on the eye's fat and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you make an incision with your cautery iron right down to the bone then all will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not then repeat the cautery once or twice as you need; and remove the iron after three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place on it a poultice with butter and care for it with drying ointment until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	But if after forty days it is not healed then place on it a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone shows; and shave it according to what came before in this chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cautery for abscesses which certain ancients have described.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Note the position of the abscess and find it; then place into its crack a thin rod, that is, a fine cannula, whose form is thus: [shape follows].
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a drachma-sized quantity of molten lead; and hold your hand with the cannula securely, so that the patient doesn't move at all, lest the melted lead run or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	You should place a poultice infused in egg white over the patient's eye, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the area of the fistula, and heals it with a wondrous cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed with what we have said about cauterization and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, it is necessary to administer a nasal passage, and redirect the fistula towards the path of the nose, according to what will come to its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	On the method of cauterizing fissures on the lips.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Fissures often occur on the lips, which are called cracks, especially on the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When you treat these fissures as we have said in the section on illnesses, and it does not provide a cure, then apply a small cautery knife with fire, according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let it be hollowed out like the sharpness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place this ignited [knife] swiftly into the very fissures until you reach the depth of the cracks with the cautery.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a caustic [ointment], until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	On the method of cauterizing an oral fistula.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gums or on the palate or at the roots of teeth: it then causes pus and breaks open; later, it heals over, but still runs with pus, thus forming a fistula; you treat this, yet no cure takes place, so you must apply a cautery ignited according to its size such that it fits within the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Insert the heated iron into the hole of the fistula and hold your hand there until the hot metal reaches its deepest point and end; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterwards with what we have said about treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	So if the pus is drained and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if it does not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what comes at its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	On how to cauterize in gingivitis and softened teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gums are softened due to humidity and the teeth move and you treat it with medicine but it does not help, then place the patient's head on your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then use the fire cautery whose form will come later so that you place the cannula over the tooth and quickly insert into it the heated cauterium: and hold your hand a moment until the patient feels the heat of the fire has now reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times according to what you want.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the patient fill their mouth with saltwater solution and hold it for an hour before spitting it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the loose tooth is made firm, the softened gum tightened and dried up, and the corrupted humidity healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	On how to cauterize for toothache.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is caused by coldness, either there is actual cold or worms, and treatment with medicine does not help, then cauterization on the tooth itself is performed in two ways: either cautery with butter or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cautery with butter involves taking fresh butter and boiling it in an iron spoon or a small pot.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Next, take a woolen cloth and wrap it around the end of a stick or probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse the cloth in the boiling butter and quickly place it on the painful tooth, holding it there until it cools. Repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	If you wish, you can also dip the wool or cloth in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, then put a heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches deep into the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cautery with fire involves using an iron or brass pipe.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	If the pipe has a thick wall, this prevents the sharp heat from reaching the patient's bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Next, apply the cautery with fire to the tooth and hold your hand there until the cautery cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Repeat this procedure several times; the pain will be removed either that same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	The patient should fill their mouth with good butter after the cautery mark and hold it there for an hour before spitting it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Scorch with whatever end you wish according to what is possible: and this is the form of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	On the method of cauterizing with hot irons.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When hot irons are affected by phlegm and cold dampness, and do not respond to treatment with medicines, and you wish to rapidly facilitate their resolution: then use a concave cautery of this shape.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Which has two tight ends so that the smoke escapes from one end of the cautery: and place it alight on top of the swelling once, and a second time if you need to, until you reach the bottom of the swelling.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	But if the swelling is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the swelling.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and apply to it lard infused with vinegar until that which was burned by the fire is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with tooth-powder ointment until the form of the cannula is restored.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	On the method of cauterizing with hoarseness of voice, and tightness of breathing.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When dampness is affecting the bronchial tubes, and especially when it comes with a cold constitution, then the patient must first be cleared out by means of liquefying medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then scorch it at night close to the base of the throat in a hollow place: and be careful not to reach with the cautery into the throat itself or anywhere on the skin except that spot.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery near the neck joint at the last of his vertebrae ending here; and let this be a claw-shaped cautery according to the method, which preceded earlier.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what has been done before until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the method of cauterizing for lung disease and cough.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and lung disease are due to cold humours, and the patient has no fever or consumption, nor an old illness: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the collar-bone in hollow places, gentle, empty ones.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let this be a pipe-shaped cautery according to the form which preceded earlier.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish your cauterization to be by pricking with a cautery called 'The Point', whose form preceded earlier for piercing ear pain: and let the points be from thirty up to almost forty in number.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what has been done before until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let this be a three-branched cautery according to the following form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Why is cauterization lightened with it when you do three cauteries together as one?
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the method of cauterizing for shoulder tickling, in dislocation of the shoulder-joint.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and it does not return to its place at once, until it gets used to returning, then it is dislocated by a slight motion which happens as we have already shown; then you ought to reduce the dislocation first of all.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient should lie down on their back or on their healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin that is inside the armpit upwards with your left hand's fingers: and if the joint is dislocated towards the inside.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then have a cauterizer over fire with two sticks.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will appear with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three sticks, which results in a shape of six cauteries: and the thinness of the sticks must be considered.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of a three-stick cautery.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one more is added to this method, which results in eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place crushed leeks with salt on the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then ensure that the patient remains calm so as not to move their limb until they are comforted.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upwards, which rarely happens, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a key-like cautery or multiple punctures.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, moisture removed, and the patient heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	On cauterizing the stomach:
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When there are excessive cold and moisture in the stomach, failing to remove it from its constitution, with catarrh forming frequently despite continued treatment, one must place the patient supine on their back with legs and arms extended.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauterizations: one thumb-sized sub-conchoidal chest cautery, a clavicle cautery, and two additional cauteries on either side of the single one below, until the arrangement forms a triangular shape.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And space them apart so they do not join when forming pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	The depth of the cautery should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	The arrangement of the cauteries should follow this form without addition, and if you wish to cauterize with a large one in the center of the stomach following this form: use a cautery instrument shaped like a circle as such.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	Cauterize the stomach by applying this frightening cautery after marking it with a hot iron in the spot and size you desire; then cauterize that mark, followed by treatment as before until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On cauterizing a cold spleen:
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When there is pain in the spleen due to cold and moisture, or thick wind, until it leaves its natural constitution by excessive discharge, and the patient is treated with what we have said above without improvement; one must place them supine on their neck, then mark with a hot iron three cauterizations like this shape, and of equal size below the spleen from the hypocondria where the tip of the elbow reaches. The space between each should be the width of a finger, and the length of the cautery that of an upright body; do not press heavily with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let its quantity be such that it is burned due to the thickness of the skin; the quantity should be half of what was added, and the patient must stand on their own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If the patient is not standing, then let them lie down with their legs already extended and arms raised.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the shape of the caustic/cauterizing iron.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed it is possible for you to use these caustic irons like a surgical knife when you have skill and caution in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And take care not to proceed too far in the cauterization and burn through all the thickness of the skin, for it will thereby burn the entire body as well, and reach the intestines; since the skin there is thin, know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Caput XXX.	Chapter Thirty.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens and you wish to know whether the abscess is in the liver's flesh or in its membrane, then if it is in the liver's flesh, it afflicts the patient with a weighty pain without sharpness; but if it is in the liver's membrane, there is pain along with severe acuteness: and now you see that its treatment has tired out his doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary, therefore, for the patient to lie down on their neck/nape.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then sketch the place of the abscess with a red-hot cautery; then take up the fiery iron, which resembles a rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape/form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize it with one cautery until the entire skin is burnt and reaches the bone, until all pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment of discharging [pus], until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And one need not use this type of cautery unless they have an extended study in the art of medicine, and these illnesses pass through their hands with some experience; then indeed will they dare to perform such operations.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But as for dismissing it, in my view, it is better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	[Section title] On the method of cauterizing in cases of pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that the root of Aristolochia (birthwort) should be used as a cold cautery for pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is necessary that you take from the dry roots of Aristolochia (birthwort), one longer root which can be found inside, and this should be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil; and light it on fire over the flame.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery where it is between the fork of the collarbone and clavicle (furcula), and two small cauteries somewhat sloping downwards towards the side that lies under the jaw.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two more cauteries where it is between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping towards the back somewhat; another on the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three more from behind: one where it is between the two scapulae; and two on either side of the chest, with the lower cautery lying between the two scapulae.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	You should not squeeze your hand with the cauterization iron; instead, it must be held in a way that allows you to smell the patient's skin clearly.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	Some ancient authorities have stated that there are individuals who use an iron cautery similar to a radius; they ignite it and insert it into the space between the ribs until they reach the abscess with the hot iron, and pus emerges as we described for liver abscesses.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But this procedure of puncturing with the cautery carries a risk that either the patient will die immediately or develop a fistula at the site which cannot be cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On cauterizing the head of the spleen: Chapter 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat a spleen disorder as we have described under the section on diseases of the spleen and your treatment is not effective, then cautery can be employed in three different ways which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One method is to make three or four cauterizations by drawing a line along the length of the spleen in the same shape as the cautery marks for the liver described earlier.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	The size of each individual cauterization should be that of a finger's breadth or more/less than this depending on the particular case.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	The method of carrying out the procedure should be as we described for liver cautery: evenly spaced out.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	Do not squeeze the patient's hand with the cautery iron; instead, let him lie on his back with you at his side.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	Another method of cautery is to ignite a two-pronged iron which we described in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; raise up the skin that lies directly over the spleen where the patient's left elbow reaches when extended; and elevate it sufficiently so that you stretch the skin across his body so that the prongs fall along his length.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two very hot sticks until you pierce the skin from the other side; then withdraw the cautery instrument; thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery instrument having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then treat the cautery instrument after you remove it, letting it discharge pus for many days; for it is more effective than all that has gone before in terms of treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery instrument must not fall on the dropsy unless it is properly covered with an asclit.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a case of dropsy with the methods of treatment that we have described above, and it does not respond to treatment, then it is necessary for you to cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another on the liver, one on the spleen, two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, one straight over the chest, and another straight over the stomach; and let the depth of the cauteries be approximately equal to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery instrument open so that it discharges pus over a long period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And you will not discharge the patient from treatment after the cautery with it: for which two intentions must be joined to it; and healing will come speedily, by God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery instrument with which you cauterize the belly should be a nail according to what has gone before in its shape; and that of the one with which you cauterize the back should be olive-shaped, according as its previous shape was.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When blisters form on the dropsy patient and fill with yellow fluid, you must cauterize above the back of the foot at night, in the place which is between the auricular and ring finger; raise your hand holding the cautery, and do not twist it; then lift your hand, and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The yellow fluid will flow out, and the cautery should be like this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with a knife-shaped end; and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below that, about midway down the leg; and over the entire hip, two cauteries; and leave the open cautery untreated for a long time: so that some water flows out of it; then treat it with the rest which we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterizing for abdominal pain.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is abdominal pain due to cold and dampness, until it weakens the retaining and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with methods of treatment but does not heal; and you see the patient bearing a strong cautery, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, as previously described for stomach cautery with a ring cautery, and four fine cauteries around the navel with a fine nail-like cautery; and one large cautery above the pubic region or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize it with a large cautery on a comb, and use the cautery on all of that area; perhaps you may also add two small cauteries near the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a successful treatment whose aid does not go astray.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or just one, and they arise from thick, cold humors or corrupted moisture, and they are treated with what we have said in division, but the treatment does not work: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower vertebra of the back slightly triangularly under the waist, and a single one below the navel about two fingers' width.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that their stomach is chilled and their food is not being digested, and you see their face breaking out in spots, then cauterize them with a large cautery on the stomach as previously described; also cauterize over their liver, and another over their spleen, with a nail-like cautery; leave the open cautery for some time; then treat it until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing ulcers after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise an ulcer, then ignite the cautery which resembles a spoke.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert it while ignited into the excised ulcer; and your last hand [i.e., as far as your hand will reach], until you reach the opening of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many carbuncles, then cauterize each one with a cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them by applying to them from among the ointments that which is appropriate until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on an alkatin, this is more effective for relief.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing fistula-in-ano.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey treatment by incision and operation as we have described in its place, and is terrified of it, perhaps he will be healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore it happens to someone that fistula becomes old, and is neglected, pus runs from it, and corrupted moisture.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is therefore appropriate that you should examine it with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then ascertain the depth of it by means of the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then light a cautery which is similar in size (to the fistula).
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce yourself, when it is lit, into the fistula, and that part which the probe entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat upon it the cautery, until they burn all those corrupted parts, once or twice or three times, according to the necessity of your situation.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself against burning the nerve if it is there or the great vein; or if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not perform it unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and you consider that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then treat the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed, and materials are cut off from it, and this remains for a long time; then know that it has now healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if materials are not cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupted bone deep inside it, or like one of those: the mention of which will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterising kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When there is pain in the kidneys due to cold or thick windiness, and it diminishes because of that weak body, then you should cauterise them over almethenem above the kidneys themselves, with a clavicle cautery on each kidney, which has been previously mentioned.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterise it a second time at the almeidatu itself.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why will three lined ones come?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Thus, they shall be more useful at the end.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterising the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When there is weakness and softening in the bladder due to cold and moisture, until the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterise it at the lower part of the suminis above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, with a right sumin cautery on one side, and another on its left; and let the length of this lateral cauterisation be equal to the size of the thumb's knot; and cauterise it with a lower back cautery, or two if needed: and let it be according to the previously mentioned clavicle cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	The method for cauterizing the womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is prevented from becoming pregnant, and her menses are corrupted, and their onset is delayed, and she experiences pain at their arrival, then she ought to be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with one cautery below the back over the alcatim, or two: and let the cautery be a clavicle.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	The method for cauterizing the anus during dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the moisture of the mucous membrane spills into the hollow of the anus, and becomes a cause of its exiting from its place: and its sign is that one leg extends beyond the other when they are compared to each other: and the site of dislocation will be found in it as empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	One ought therefore to cauterize the patient above the anus's hollow with a similar circular cautery: after you mark with encausticum around the hollow as it turns: and so that the hollow itself falls into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery's shape be similar to that which preceded in stomach cauterization.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If you do not have this cautery available, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-oil cautery: and let the cautery's depth be according to the thickness of all the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The method of cauterization for sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When there is pain in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and dampness: and if treating the patient with what we have said earlier does not help and the condition persists, then it is necessary to rid the patient of gross humours with fetid pills or artificial pills and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him/her.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization on it is according to two methods: either a cauterizing agent with adhering medicines or a cauterizing iron with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	A cauterizing iron with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that the cauterizing irons are placed over the hip joint in three triangular shapes, according to this form: [drawing not included]
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them of good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space between each cauterization be the size of a fingertip, and let it be an olive-oil cauterization.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes there is also a cauterization in the middle, right on top of the hip joint.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Because there are four cauterizations.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose shape previously appeared in the cauterization for hip dislocation, make it so that the circle contains the entire hip.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn away all of the thickness of the skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is attached to the hip itself and does not extend down into the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauterizations over the hip, over the place where the patient indicates pain is felt, and with your own cautery over the shinbone four fingers away from the outer side: and let the cauterization be done with a knife.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient indicates that the pain extends near the toes, then cauterize it where they indicate with a single-point, three-point, four-point or multi-point cautery, as needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if they indicate pain beneath the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a single knife-point cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And be careful in all your cautery procedures not to press down hard enough with the cautery that you burn nerves or a large artery, and thereby cause harm to the patient through severe damage or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have seen one and another among those who cauterized over the shinbone and pressed too hard in their cautery procedure, and the leg became swollen until the swelling reached the foot, and it ruptured entirely, and the entire foot was destroyed: then there occurred an abdominal hernia, and death soon after.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have said about the cautery of the shoulder that this is its method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar iron cup with a diameter of half a palm's width: and let it be at its opening the thickness of a finger's core or less by a little bit: and inside this cup let there be another third cup.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there should be the space equivalent to that between every finger according to the quantity of the knuckle of the thumb; and they must be open on both sides; and their height ought to be that of a knot, or two knots; and make for them handles out of iron, decently fitted into the scoops.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is held in the fire until it glows red and throws sparks; then place it on a jar of vinegar with the affected limb resting weakly on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Scorch him therefore with three round cauteries at one sitting.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it alone for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards plaster with butter; and leave the wound open many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says of this kind of cautery, my sons, we have made little use because of the fearsome look of it; and also because there are few whom we find will await its application.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless it is among the good cauterizations for him who suffers it; and he will find its place useful.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But if the cautery is to be used with medicinals then you should make two scoops having a perforated band which descends into the hinge of its door from brass or iron, as long as the wall; and their height ought to be that of two knots, or like themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be the space equivalent to that between each other according to the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and they must be open below and above; and it is such as will contain one another, according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on an anchor jar, with the patient lying on their healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly over the anchor jar.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles some hot water, heated with fire for a while, and keep it there for a time equivalent to an hour; let the patient bear its bite and burning, for they find its bite like that of fire until the biting ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe away all hot water from the anchor with fresh water; then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter over it until the burning blackness is removed; then leave it for a few days, and there will be pus coming out of it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For this is the final part of the treatment.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg: make for them a statue containing water where it is affected by the pain, just as you did for the anchor jar equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is how hot water should be used; I have already written it down in the book of pharmaceutical corrections.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take equal parts of alkali and unslaked lime; grind both, then place them in a new pot with its lower part pierced by one small hole according to the size that would fit a radius bone inside it: place under the bottom of this pot another worn-out pot: pour over the alkali and lime fresh water until they are submerged by an inch. After which you press it firmly with your hand; leave the pots as such until cold water comes out from the lower part of the worn-out jar.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then pour all that water onto another lime and cook it until it becomes new again.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	It will then be very strong caustic that is used in many medical procedures and in cauterizing other body parts.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And they are among the medicines with which the ancha is cauterized; also like tesisie, and wild honey, and lime mixed with soap so that both are combined.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And indeed Galen told about the treatment of an ancient man who was cured of pain in the hip and sciatic vein; and he praised it as being very effective.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	He said that he did not require any other treatment and was healed with a single application of the medicine until he reported that perhaps he entered a bath while carrying it, and left already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from green setaragi; and if you cannot find the green type then use a dry fresh one instead, grinding it with some fat and applying it to wherever there is pain in the hip, leg or thigh; bandaging it for three hours or as long as the patient can bear the burning sensation.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then place him in a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When his body is damp, place him on a couch.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain goes away and he heals.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you should know that no one should use an iron cauterizer with these medicines unless after the body has been evacuated.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that goat dung, when it is used to cauterize the sciatic vein, benefits it; and it becomes a caustic agent in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Wool should be taken and soaked in old oil, then placed on the deep spot located between the big toe and the one next to it.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and ignite it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place [the charcoal] on top of the wool and leave it there until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore, you should not cease doing this until sensation returns to the affected area via movement up to the groin, and the pain is alleviated.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this manner of cautery is called the 'Goat Cautery'.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Concerning the cauterization for back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	At times, pain occurs in the back due to many causes—either by accident or impact, or due to superfluous evacuation (of bodily waste), and similar occurrences caused by an influx of cold and moist matter: and cauterization is not suitable except for this one type, which results from the influx of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with foul-smelling pills or similar, three lines should be drawn across the back where there is pain according to the width of the patient's thumb, and once marked with encaustic [paint], five cauterizations (or more depending on the quantity that results from the tolerance of the patient's strength) are applied along each line; and this cauterization should be done using a cautery needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a clavate central cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of cauterization at the beginning of a hernia.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in boys is: when it happens to him as a tightening with shortness of breath during exertion, and movement; and you find at the lower end of the spine and its knobs, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you see it like this and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery cover all parts of the vertebra equally; and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a two or three-pronged cautery, and let the prongs be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the area until it heals with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware of using the cautery on a hernia that is caused by a spasm of nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterization for podagra and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are caused by cold humidity that overflows to any part of the body, then when they happen to the feet, it is customary for doctors to call it podagra specifically.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When gout caused by cold is treated with the methods of cure and the pain does not go away, then the cautery removes it.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is necessary that you cauterize him after evacuation at the joints of the feet with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make a puncture over the surface of the foot, then use the dot-shaped cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pain rises up to the knees or other joints, and this happens frequently, then cauterize it over each knee with three cauteries, or four on every side, using the same Claw-shaped cautery.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if more of this cautery is necessary, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not plunge your hand with the cautery, but let it be about as thick as the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If the pain rises to the knees and back, then apply what we have said from the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pain is only in the hands, then make a puncture around the wrist where two lines meet and diverge.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if there is still pain in the fingers, then make a puncture on each knuckle and also over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If the pain rises after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize each on every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And you do not discharge the sick man from good regimen or from taking medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	If a good diet is maintained and the phlegm is evacuated, healing will occur by God's help with this caustic.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the method of cauterizing ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When there is a rupture in the groin and the intestine descends or the bag comes close to the testicle, then you should advise the patient to forgo food for that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And he should take something laxative so that his stool descends from the belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back; and tell him to hold his breath until the bag or intestine comes out.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Next, bring it back with your fingers and mark it with caustic under the rupture on the pectineal bone, making a sign whose end is like half a circle towards the upper body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then use a fire to cauterize it with this shape until it becomes white and flakes fall off.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Next bring the intestine or bag back to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the assistant put his hand on that place so that the intestine does not come out: and you have opened between the patient's legs, placed a pillow underneath him, and one servant is on his legs, another on his chest holding his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Next put the caustic on that mark with your hand held straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold on to it until you reach the bone with it; or repeat with it a second time if you have not reached the bone with it the first time.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And observe with caution from the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and thereby upon the patient befall either death or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not achieve with the cauterization of the bone, your operation is not helpful.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it should be that the cautery for infants is delicate, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the other ointments until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on their back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you provide nourishment for the duration of their treatment, which soothes their belly; so that the intestine does not leave during strain and defecation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when they wish to rise after forty days, then apply a strap made poorly, and let them wear it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And they should be lessened from work, and fullness of food and drink, and loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when one follows this regime, they heal with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I shall say the treatment of ruptures with incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	But when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and they are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize their rupture with a round cautery according to its size; and let what is burned be like one third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat it with what we have said; and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some of the first [surgeons] said: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular shaped cautery like this.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is sealed with wax, and a line placed which runs across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the pointed cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first [method] is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the method of cauterization for pains caused by falling or being struck.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When there is pain in some limbs caused by falling or being struck and the pain persists over a long period of time without healing with medicines, then it should be treated with the pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And the size of the cautery should be appropriate for each limb, taking into account its size, weakness and strength, as well as the location of any twisting or pain.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If it therefore heals with the first [treatment], that is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat on the same spot.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For it is customary of these pains to move from the limb to that which is closest to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Which is why you must follow them with the cautery until the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the method of cauterization for leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Leprous people sometimes benefit from being cauterized greatly.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy, which arises due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy; when you wish to cauterize it, therefore consider this.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is in its beginning stages and you have treated it with what we said earlier in our division but it has not descended or stopped; and you are afraid that corruption will overcome his entire constitution: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the scalp, and a second below this towards the front near the end of the hairline, and two on each temple area, and one behind on the back of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally hold your hand with the cautery there briefly until it imprints a small impression on the bone and some of its layers are dislocated so that you alleviate the exhalation of thick vapors from him; and cauterize also over his spleen, as we mentioned previously.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the afflicted and is clearly apparent then it behooves you to cauterize him with those same cauteries which we mentioned for the head; and also a cautery on the tip of his nose, and two cauteries over both jawbones, and two cauteries over the vertebrae of his neck, and six over the vertebrae of his back, and one large one on his coccyx (tailbone) and one above it in the gluteal area; and two over each hip: that is to say one over each hip bone and two over both knees: one over each knee and two over his shoulders, and two over his elbows, and two over the tenderness of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint, from among all of the finger joints of his hands and feet; and cauterize also over all the heel bones in his feet and the palms of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are above the back of the heel, so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery over the breastbone, and another over the stomach, and another over the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply the cautery, the greater the benefit and the more effective it is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because their body has already become numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of different sizes and widths according to the limbs and joints, just as was stated previously regarding the types of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the cautery with a paste of herb flour mixed with honey, and continue with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the method of cauterizing for stupor (loss of sensation).
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any limb becomes numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but does not heal, then cauterize the affected numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of that limb.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	Let your cautery penetrate into the thickness of the skin just slightly.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized for a type of numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, at the vertebrae of the back near where the nerves emerge which move that limb; and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	Indeed, one must not presume to do so unless they are wise in the anatomy of members and the emergence of nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterization, in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When you treat Albaras and do not add anything to it from the art of medicine: then cauterize over it with a deep cauterization to some extent, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its colour changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a mixture of herb flour and lentil flour with rose oil, arnica leaves, pigeon blood, and swallow blood: let there be one part of each; mix all these together, lay them on a cloth, and attach this to the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterization for cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is starting, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cauterization around its circumference, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The wise have said that one should cauterize with the final cauterization in its middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	That does not seem right to me, for I fear that it may ulcerate; and indeed I have seen this happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that one be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we said; or with multiple cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterization for adobelatis.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has a swelling that is slow to mature, either due to the excess of humours causing it or because of the age of the patient who has little blood and is decrepit, or because of time constraints, and you need to hurry up the maturation of the swelling, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For itself will hurry up with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you want to perforate it with the cautery then heat up a cautery that is of this shape: [shape inserted in original prompt]
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the swelling until it penetrates the skin and let the patient be treated with what follows to alleviate the course of purity.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the method of cauterizing an ulcerating sore.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	An ulcerating sore is nothing other than a corruption walking on the limb and consuming it like fire eats dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If you see an ulcerating sore in a place that can tolerate being burnt with fire then burn it with many fires, small and large nails, according to what is appropriate for the location of the ulcer.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then burn it from all sides until you uproot the entire corruption so that nothing of it remains whatsoever.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it alone for three days and put ground sulphur mixed with oil on the places that have been burnt until all scabs and corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with flesh-generating salves.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days flesh is born of healthy constitution, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery on that which remains of the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And corrosive medicines are sometimes treated with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it arises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, the cautery with fire is of swifter aid: and indeed I have already said its cauterization with sharp medicine in the division: so take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterizing in claws and warts.
Caput LV.	Section 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Many times this illness occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered thing that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed the cautery on them is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As much as it is with fire, make the cautery bowl similar to an eagle's feather: which shall be made of iron, according to the size that contains a nail on every side: and let it be thin at the edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it burning over the claw.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn the hand with the cautery around the claw, until you reach the depth of the claw: and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply plasters made with crushed mulberries, mixed with salt; leave the plaster on overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with an emollient for newborn skin until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on hands and feet: then apply a hot iron cauterization to them; take a copper, iron or vulture feather pipe and place it over a nail or charcoal ember.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the pipe; hold your hand and rotate it with finger pressure for a while so that the edge of the pipe touches the root of the nail, allowing the hot water to reach deep down to the root of the nail: have the patient wait a little over the hot-water cauterization for about an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it be, for the nail will be eradicated along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this to each one after another until you have treated all of them on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they are eradicated with something that generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of tremor cauterization:
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When someone has a tremor from cold nerve damage or from quartan fever or some other cause: then you should cauterize them with four to five hot iron probes over the vertebrae and between each vertebra with one probe; on their chest with another, and over their stomach with yet another.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremors are calmed with olive oil cauterization, and healing is hastened for ailments that are cold.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	In the way of cauterization by Albucasis.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes bad humours, that is boils, are expelled from the body which arise from corrupted gross matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore it is necessary that when they first appear, the boils should be cauterised over their entire head with a fine myrtle wood stick whose end has been lit by fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a bean-shaped iron cauterizer.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterised at the beginning of their formation in this way: and they do not increase: and the superfluity that makes them is broken apart, and they are cured of it.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However it must be done after evacuation by bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the way of cauterization for bleeding from an artery into a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that there is bleeding from an artery which has been cut at a wound, which occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or member cauterization, and similar to these: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	So when it happens to someone, then quickly place your hand over the artery opening, and put your index finger on top of it: and squeeze it a lot, until the blood is blocked underneath your finger, and nothing comes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place on the fire small olive oil-based cauteries and several large ones; blow upon them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of these, small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been severed, and apply the cautery to the vein; then remove your finger quickly and hold the cautery in position until the bleeding stops.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled as you raise your finger from the artery opening and the cautery goes out, then quickly take another cautery from those already prepared on the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not stop applying one after another until the bleeding stops.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, lest another evil happen to the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop it unless by one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or by extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends contract and the bleeding stops.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it may be tied with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or place on it some medicines which have the property of stopping blood, and bind it with a suitable compress.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	He who accomplishes the stopping of blood by means of a ligament and a compress, or by the application of burning substances and the like, should never apply them to him completely except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to someone and there is no doctor present nor medicine: then begin with the placement of the index finger on the vein's opening, as we described, and its strong compression until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed from it but placed above with very cold water until the blood clots and thickens, then cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile consider what it requires from cauterization or medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	End of the first part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Book II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On incision, perforation, and bloodletting with regard to wounds and similar issues.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the first chapter about every illness that requires a burning cautery and medicinal fire, along with its opportunities, causes, instruments, and types of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed there chapters from head to foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path so that the seeker may find what they are looking for.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, my sons, you must learn that what is in this chapter regarding fear differs from the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this it is necessary for there to be greater caution, since in the operation which is described in this chapter, there frequently occurs an evacuation with blood, together with which stands life at the opening of a vein or incision on a boil, abscess, wound, arrow extraction, or stone cutting, and those similar: from all of which arises trembling, fear, and death falls upon many.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I advise you not to fall into uncertainty over that which is doubtful, for sometimes such kinds of people come before you with such kinds of ailments.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For amongst them are those who become angry when suffering from illness and for whom death is a light matter because of the severity of what they experience through their ailment and the long duration of its evil.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when illness arises from fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And amongst them is he who offers you his flute-player, enriching you with him in the hope of health, while his sickness is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it should not be that you agree with him who comes to you from amongst them whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more severe than your greed and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume about anything concerning him unless after certain knowledge which verifies to you that for which his worthy lineage has arrived.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use for the treatment of all your patients prognosis and indication regarding that which is appropriate for health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in it lies your aid regarding the achievement of fame and glory, memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with His understanding and not withhold from you guidance and inspiration, for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And indeed I have arranged this Chapter by dividing it into chapters as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization from the neck down to the feet so that your search for what you wish and need out of it may be lightened.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	The treatment for water accumulation on children's heads.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this condition often happens to children at birth or when the midwife grips the child's head without caution.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it happens, there is also an unknown hidden cause that cannot be known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	Indeed, I have not seen this sickness anywhere but in children, and among those whom I saw all rushed into death; for that reason, it seemed to me best to abandon any treatment of such a condition.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have seen a child among them whose head was filled with water and his head kept growing every day until he could not sit upright due to the size of his head; moisture kept accumulating until death.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture may gather either between the skin and bone or beneath the bone above the skull.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And for the treatment of this condition, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make an incision on top of the head running across its width; let the length of the incision be about two finger widths until the moisture drains out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of a spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If then the moisture is more accumulated, and the abscess is larger, you should make two such incisions.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and its sign is that you see openings on top of the head from every side; and water is pressed down when you press it with your hand towards the inside, but it does not hide itself: then you should make three incisions on top of the head like this.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after making an incision, extract all moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then close the wounds with cloths and plugs.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	After that, anoint it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with sutures and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not fail to keep the head bound tightly with its counterpart.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	Feed the patient dry food of little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	Another method of incision is to note where the swelling appears large and water collects.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is greater at the back of the head, or on the forehead, or to the right, or left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Thus ascend with your incision to where the swelling and water collection appear, then split it as seems best to you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	Take care not to cut an artery, lest the patient bleed out and die from that evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	### On Incision of the arteries found behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter two.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When someone has catarrh to the eyes or chest and it is not relieved by medicinal treatments, then this ultimate cure remains only for them - incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	When you wish to make such an incision then the patient should lean their head back.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the spot with a rough cloth to make the arteries visible.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the patient should tighten their neck with each of their cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulses.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both (veins) are the sunken areas behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with encaustic on both (veins): and cut both (veins) with spatums on either side using a needle, the incision reaching to the bone: and let it be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the spatums under the artery, and cut it above with an upward incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood flows out in a pulsating manner, which jumps into the interiors with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you should measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with encaustic, and find (the artery) until you reach the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And the amount of blood that should be let out is six ounces, and perhaps you emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of that according to the amount which appears to you of the patient's strength and the fullness of their artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything of it remains reaching to the bone, then cut that, so that a hot abscess does not occur: then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Treat it then with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries which are in temples.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a person suffers from an old headache or acute catarrh due to acrid moistness and heat in the arteries of the temples, or from old, severe, or similar sodden humours: And if it is treated with medical remedies but does not yield to them: Then we have found in these ailments that the extraction of arteries from the temples or their cauterisation is efficacious as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operating on such an extraction is for the patient to shave off the hair which is on his temples and concentrate on the artery which appears therein.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it shows itself to you by its pulse; rarely is it hidden except in very few people or severe coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you then the patient should bind his head with any cloth; afterwards rub that place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or bathe the place with warm water until it appears to you clearly.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula which I formed just now.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Afterwards scrape with it the skin gently until you reach that artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw into it a hook and extract it upwards until you have extracted it from the skin; then make it escape out of any garments which are underneath.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is thin; then wrap it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut away a portion of it according to the extent by which its ends extend, and they are pulled back without causing any loss of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	If it is not cut, nor if it is severed, the blood does not stop flowing entirely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then extract six ounces of blood from it until three remain.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large, you should tie it in two places using double-threaded silk string or strong chords of aloe wood so that corruption does not quickly set into its substance before wound healing and blood loss occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the superfluity which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour or one hour later.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterise it with the knife-shaped cautery until reaching its bone, so that its ends may be excised and it will remain at this same place.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And the outcome is better unless the patient has fever or they have a hot constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because the cautery is among those things which help to end moistness.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it helps more effectively.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the removal of arteries, the place should be filled with old tallow and decently made crumbled poultices placed over it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the discharge, it should be treated with drying medicines which promote flesh generation as well as dressings until healing occurs.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If in the meantime while operating a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hasten to sever it with the cautery or fill up its place with egg white and squeeze your hand until the blood is severed.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of these are present to you at this moment, then place your finger on the wound until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	Wet the place with ice-cold water until the sharpness subsides and it tightens as needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And for that which is lighter and easier to remove by means of the artery, you should cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives; and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to that of almagdate.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they were sharp like two knives, it would hasten both the cold; and they wouldn't cut into the flesh quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Since there is a bit of thickness to them, some heat from the fire is retained within them, and they cut through flesh quickly; with this it's best to use this approach for every operation that requires speed, ease, and gentleness.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between the two knives be a thickness equal to that of your finger, after you mark both places with encaustic; and place each one red hot until they reach the mouth, and cut into the vein in two spots: so as to lengthen what is between its ends.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For it doesn't fully consolidate with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment for frequent sharp pain in the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are frequent and their course is from veins that are on the outside of the head; and you have not tried any cure with medicine or remedies, and see that the patient's face has now turned red, and they feel a crawling sensation on their forehead like ants crawling: and their eyes are exhausted, moist, so much that already their lashes are corroded by corrosion: and their eyelids are heated from the sharpness of tears; then the ancients required this operation for their cure, and named it *a cura cum ensi*, or "treatment with a sword".
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is essential to advise the patient to shave the hair from their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions on the forehead, evenly spaced according to the length of the forehead; let the length of each incision be about two fingers long, and have one incision equidistant from the nose in the center of the forehead, a second along the length slightly away from the movement of the eyebrows, and a third on the other side. And beware that you do not cut any arteries on either side, and stretch your hand out from the connection of the two jaws, and let the entire space of the incision be equal to three fingers put together: also have for yourself a piece of prepared sponge or many dry cloths with which to dry up the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a spatula of two sharp ends, whose subsequent shape is as follows: [diagram not included].
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the first incision near the temple to the second incision, scrape away all skin that lies between the two incisions, along with the bone above the eye socket.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do likewise from the middle incision to the second one.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then withdraw the spatula, and reinsert another tool into the first incision, which is called a sharp knife, blunt on one side but sharp on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form: [diagram not included]
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	Position the sharp side of its edge towards the attached flesh and skin, and the blunt side towards the bone; push it in until you reach the middle incision, and sever with it all those vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except for what continues with the incision up to where skin is visible.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do likewise at the middle incision down to the other one.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	After some quantity of blood has drained out evenly, squeeze those places from pieces of clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put linen rags soaked in old wine on every crack, and place over them little pads moistened with wine or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	See to it that no hot abscess occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	On the third day, loosen the bandage and apply plenty of wash with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with healing ointment of basil and other things that are used to heal wounds until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	On the treatment of sharp pains in the eyes, also of catarrh from an internal head cold.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When someone has severe, sharp and persistent catarrh and you see their eyes tired, small, and the sight of them already weakened; and the eyelids ulcerated, with hairs falling out from them, and deep in the head there is a sharp, painful sensation followed by sneezing: then take from these symptoms that those substances [the discharges], and catarrhs do not come except from numerous veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment for them is this:
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you prescribe to the sick person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make in it one crack in the middle of the forehead or slightly across its width and start with the fissure from the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be up to the bone; and stretch out your hand from the muscles of both temples which move when chewing until you feel the bone: and dry all blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the wound with a swab of old linen, or with strips of new linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then compress from above with swabs; and moisten the swabs with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you uncover it, and see that the hot abscess is now diminished; then you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that makes flesh grow; for example, take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the birthplace of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the treatment for that which falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral substance, or similar to stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, like chickpeas and beans; or it is a liquid, such as water and vinegar, and things like them; or it is an animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone or stony substance falls into the ear from among those which are not added to and do not grow within the ear, expose the ear to the sun; if you then see that it is a stone, then instil into the ear some of either violative oil or sesame oil.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then apply the procedure for extracting it and make them sneeze with mustard seed; plug their nostrils as they sneeze, after you place around the ear a pad made of cloth or wool, and stretch out the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For often it comes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If it does not come out, then perform its removal with a gesture, that is, with delicate pincers; whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If it therefore comes out with the gesture, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then perform its removal with a delicate blind hook of little curvature.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not come out through that, then make a copper tube, and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole deeply, and apply what is in the circumference of the tube with soft wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for the wind except through the tube; then extract it with your strong attracting breath.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For many times indeed it comes out with that which we have narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If however it does not come out this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from viscum, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the end of a stick after you wrap around it a piece of skin positioned eccentrically: then insert it into the ear hole easily, after you dry the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to cut it open, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the mode of the cut is such that a weak flea first bites on the head: and extract from it blood according to the measure of its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the weak one sit between your hands, and turn its ear upwards, and find a small cut in the root of the ear near its fat in a depressed place on it: and let the cut be moon-shaped until you reach the bone: then remove it with what is possible for you from instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew up your incision with speed and tend it until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If an object has fallen into the ear due to one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not yield to your extraction, then take a thin, fine spatula like this:
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the removal of that type of grain which falls into the ear and do not attempt it when you think that the grain has already been softened by the vapour of the ear until you have tried many times; then remove them with hooks, or with a thin probe, or with suction, as we have said, for their extraction is facilitated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the case of water which enters the ear, the patient must use sneezing as treatment at first; and already he has filled his ear with some old oil; and he is lying on that ear in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	Therefore if it comes out by itself, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if it does not, then take many pebbles the length of a finger, thin and soft, and warm them with fire for a while, and let the patient introduce one of these into his ear-hole: and let him jump on one foot from that side, striking with another pebble against the pebble which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	So do not cease doing this with pebble and pebble until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out to such an extent that you may take a straw or a reed and introduce one end of it into the ear; and light the other end with fire until most of it is burnt.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Repeat with another reed and do so many times until all the water comes out; then extract it along with the tube as mentioned before for the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	When extracting an animal that has entered it, if it is a small body, such as a flea, and similar to it, take care of it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that can be felt: then carry out its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all those things which are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	When extracting a worm born in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division and in the treatise of distillations, and your treatment does not succeed; then you must look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If something of the worm appears there, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing of it appears there, then take a tube whose form is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top; and introduce the fine end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate; then suck hard with it.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do so many times until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to come out, then apply some wax around the tube with a wick, as I said for the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with what we have said, then carry out the distillations which the ancients have already experienced in killing worms; and you will find it in the treatise of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And your infusion which you pour the oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	You can see that it should be made from silver or bronze, with the lower part narrow and having a small hole, the upper part wide.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it therefore be made of bronze, off-centre to the part that is inside the cavity of the tube.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a stick and wrap around its end a little cotton with an appropriate number of windings; then pour oil or juice or whatever remedy you like from among these medicines into the tube; let it be in the ear; next insert the stick with the cotton above it, and express it by compressing it with your hand using moderate pressure until oil is forced into the cavity of the ear and the patient feels it inside; and let what is poured into the ear already have been warmed up a little with fire: and beware that nothing which is distilled into it be very cold: for remedies do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	### Treatment of the Accident of Earwax ###
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes children come out of their mothers' wombs unpierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens that earwax accumulates in some people due to injury or the growth of flesh there.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this earwax sometimes forms deep inside the hole of the ear, beyond sight; and it occasionally happens near its outer edge where vision can reach it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which occurs deep inside the ear, beyond sight's reach, is difficult to cure in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And for that which vision can reach, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and look inside; then if you see any visible wax, open it with a fine probe of this shape, whose end has some width with one part sharp; and let the rest of the probe be two smooth sides: so as not to hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the obstruction is born of flesh within the ear canal, then grasp it with a fine hook and cut it away easily until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a fine, soft rod and heat it slightly over a flame; then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you perceive the obstruction along with what the patient describes as a heaviness of hearing, attempt to open it easily; and take care not to injure the ear's nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a linen plug according to the size of the opening you wrapped in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure the wound is healed.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take linen and soak it in rosewater, then sprinkle over it some powdered frankincense, and use this.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear starting to fester, then remove the linen and leave it with another which you wrap in a poultice made from oil and rosewater until the abscess cools; then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If there is bleeding, then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear; and use the remaining treatment which stops blood flow as described previously in the section on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On treating sore eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These sore eyelids which occur on the eye, sometimes are wet and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	So you must hold them with forceps; or with a hook, and cut them away with a spatule from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place ground galbanum on the wound.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If any of them ooze blood, then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after the operation.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often recur when some of their roots remain.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not recur.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of eyelid cysts.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens that something occurs in the eyelids which resembles a cyst in its strength and hardness, and on account of this it is called a cyst; and it is a collection of thick moisture in the upper or lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation for them is as follows: you should then consider whether the cyst which appears from the eyelid and moves in all directions is proceeding in it; and its consistency is soft.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, make an incision above it across the width [of the eyelid].
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it out from all sides with ease until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then snatch it away with a hook, and tear it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if its tearing away is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision to some extent, then it harms the patient in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the incision is large, then gather it with a suture; and treat it until it is healed.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	If it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it and fleshes it out.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the hailstone is sloped towards the inner surface of the ear, then turn over the eyelid and hook out the hailstone with a crochet-hook; besides which you must make an incision and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is stretched by means of an incision, that will not do any harm.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after removal of the hailstone with salt water; and treat the place with something that fleshes it out until the patient is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelid swelling.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is the fat that forms under the eyelids; it happens most often to children. It weighs down their eyes and causes them to have morning cataracts, so they cannot look at sunlight because tears run into their eyes. That's why you see them lying on their faces all the time and sleeping with their faces downwards: the moisture from their eyelids runs beneath their eyebrows, which already are swollen; Axirnath is a protuberance that appears in the eye, and when you press it with your fingers you feel Axirnath between your fingers.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	The mode of treatment is that the patient should put his head on your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare some lint within it; make out of this lint a circle to the size that matches Axirnath from every side.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Place him on it and press with your fingers from all sides so that the navel gathers at the center of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find at the center of that moisture with a spatula striking cracks across its width, and let no crack be larger than that which forms during deep phlebotomy.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or you should split the skin entirely until you reach the navel because in many conditions the navel proceeds from a crack according to the shape of a white piece of fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract it therefore with a cloth that you have moistened between your fingers towards the outside and rotate your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed: take care not to add any into the crack lest you reach the eye with the spatula and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if the navel does not appear to you at the beginning of the crack then you should add a little gently into the crack until the navel proceeds from it.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Submerge the cloths in vinegar and water then place them on the site and compress it with pads.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	There are people who rub salt into it and place it in the hollow of the crack so that what remains of that moisture melts away.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if a hot abscess should occur then treat it with soothing poultices until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the ways of eyelid drooping, that is when the eyelid softens so it creases improperly.
Caput XI.	Chapter Eleven.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When there grow on the eyelids of the eye extra hairs beyond the normal course underneath the natural hair, and they become too long: then these harm the eye, and cause ailments to occur such as frequent tears, softening of the eyelids, and whiteness, until it becomes a cause for destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	Ataxmir's eye indeed is cured according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by fire-cauterization.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with an acute medicine, as mentioned previously in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Ataxmir is also cured by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with tubes, as I will explain.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary to place the patient's head on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eye's eyelid with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned then that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if it is not turned: introduce the needle into it with a thread attached from its lower part of the eyelid and make the needle penetrate together with the thread from above, and have that be near the hair itself, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hair grows; then pull the thread upwards along with the eyelid, and turn it back using a rod.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find the inner part of the eyelid underneath the extra hair using an incision from the larger lacrimal to the smaller one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth underneath the eyelid; then mark over the eyelid with cauterizing iron in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid; for this varies already among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For some of them require that a large portion be cut from the eyelid according to the size which is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when you have placed the spatulate end over the two lines which you marked, begin from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct and let there be one incision near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a spoke.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce the hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape away all of it.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture, using a needle and fine woolen thread; wipe away any blood, and make adhere that which is superfluous of the threads over both eyebrows, with some sticky substances if you wish to do so; but if not, take no care.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days; afterward tend to it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without suture, and tend to it with something that dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the wound's sealing and its bringing together; yet it will be better still.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of treatment ancient physicians taught to Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However there is concern for the patient; and it is of good skill; nor is fear within him.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And there is another method to Ataxmir also; it is that you mark upon the eyelid a shape which is like the form of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate or combined hooks, following this form, then cut away the excess with small scissors, following this shape, with equal cutting.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not even out: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger lachrymal, and a second thread near the smaller lachrymal: and gather together between your fingers the threads with equal force.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with an equal elevation; and lift the skin over which the tumor is marked, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture; and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if an abscess occurs near your incision or your opening, subdue that abscess with a poultice and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelid as well, that its hairs turn inward.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is therefore necessary that you use on it what we have said about incision; but suture is more of an art.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	§ On the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is necessary that you turn the eyelid back, and split open the opening which is inside, as I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two reeds or two slender sticks with art, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than a spatula; and you have already cut at each end from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather each [part] with precision over that which protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and tighten the two tubes from both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin will die, darken, and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	Therefore if you delay, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is strengthened, lift the eyelid: and do not pluck out the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of the two tubes, which you will make according to this figure, and size in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On removing hairs that irritate the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this case is that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a thin, soft silk thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather its ends, and tie each one with a very fine knot; and let the length of the threads be one palm's width.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then tie underneath it another fine thread that is short, and knot its ends if you like.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then have the patient place their head in your lap, and let it be close to the sun so that the operation may be revealed; for this is a precise or delicate operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with its thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract from above a natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw out the needle above the splint; and introduce into the splint that needle; be it one or two or three, no more than this.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw out your hand with it until the needle emerges from the eyelid together with the natural eyelash.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the splint is drawn and the needle does not emerge with it; draw out the splint downwards, with the thread you have attached to it, until the splint comes out of the upper opening, and see it with your eye: then draw out the splint and the thread, close up the eye and leave it shut for two or three days, until the eyelash adheres in its place and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the eyelash is short then either attach to it a long artificial hair and raise that with it; or leave it alone until it grows longer, and only then lift it up.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of an abscess which occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this abscess happens to the eye, it is called leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this abscess is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	An accidental one forms from the congealing of a wound or incision, or a burn, or something similar to those.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	The method of treating it is to open up the congealed material and separate its lips; you should then put between them a little flaxen wick and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And you must not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict; for if you do so the abscess will return worse than it was before: rather use things which soften it, such as fenugreek; and an ointment mixed with water in which marshmallow has been cooked, flax-seed and diaquilaon which has been liquefied with some oil: bind this on with a wick and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	The treasure of your treatment lies in ensuring that you consider every type of mind so that it does not solidify into the same form as before.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	This operation we described is simply a correction of the Alxatrata so that the form of the place does not return to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On treating Alxatrata which occurs on the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This condition which occurs on the lower eyelid is truly called 'Alxatrata'.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	It occurs accidentally from a wound or tear, by burning with a hot iron, or similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	The way to operate on it is to take a needle with double thread and dip it into the flesh; then make it pierce from left to right of the tear duct until the thread comes out at both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then raise the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it through lengthwise with a wide lancet.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the form of the eyelid returns as it should be, that is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	If not, take a splint and place it in the tear; then turn the eyelid with it. Make two incisions on the inside of the eyelid between its two corners so that they meet to form an angle like this: [draws Λ]. When joined together, their shape is the Greek letter lambda (Λ).
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh in an amount equal to the acute inferior edge of his eye from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join together the separated parts, suturing them with woolen thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said about softening medications and linen dressings until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an abscess occurs from a split or suture, or from cauterization, then you must open the split with a plain scalpel under the eyelashes, likewise what has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with linen as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the main point about treating an abscess when it is above or below is to carry out that operation as prepared according to the form of the abscess.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it has many varieties of form: and a prudent practitioner prepares his skill according to whichever mode is possible for him until he restores the figure to its natural shape or close to it, and himself being infirm as befits him from the operation and the instruments in most arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	On adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or the cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this adhesion occurs to many people such that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural movements.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	You should therefore introduce the end of a needle under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then cut through the adhesion with a blunt spatula that is not sharp like spatulas usually are but rather somewhat dull: so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and for the spatula not to be removed and injure the eye with its sharpness; and let your incision be like you would scrape off that adhesion gently until when the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the whole adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Pour some saltwater into the eye and wash it out with water; or drip onto it a mixture of saffron dissolved in water distilled from sieved henbane.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye using a strip of linen; place over the eye some wool soaked in the white of an egg; after three days use henbane and poultices until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the excision of ingrown nails and flesh mounds on the eyelids...
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that an ingrown nail is of two types.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	It may be horn-like; like hard, thin potsherd.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it may be non-horny, like white frozen moisture; when this touches iron or you try to pick it up with a hook, it breaks and is not pierced by the hook.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And neither type begins except from the larger eyelid, gradually growing until it covers sight and hinders movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	The method for excising it is as follows: have the patient put their head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and lift up the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the nail using a double-pronged hook, extending it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Next, take a needle and insert into it some horsehair, cattle hair or goat hair; let the thread be strong, double over the needle's end somewhat, then fasten it to the middle of the nail; pierce through with the needle, tie up the nail with the thread, extending it upwards: scrape away the side of the nail that follows after the pupil, as if you were plucking it with hair all the way back.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then make an incision into the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal sac with a thin spatula or with small scissors; and leave the natural lacrimal flesh untouched so that you do not cause, as a result of its incision, a continuous flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the claw is extended with only one hook; or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it with a gentle spatula that looks like this [shape].
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful not to let the spatula touch the corneal layer so that you do not cause a rupture in it, and the pupil is perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, throw into the eye some ground salt or something made from zinjar and leave it there until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is required until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the claw is not nervous and you cannot insert a needle into it or hook it, then this type of claw is often treated with medicines and heals as I have described above.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you want to incise it, then open the sick eye and take a thin spatula that is gentle and blunt, with this shape [shape].
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape away the claw above with a razor very carefully.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it becomes thinner and breaks under the razor, then drop into the eye from your vessel something made from zinjar or red medicine or ground salt; and bandage the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat this procedure on it until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	If there is no pus in your eye and it is warm, then leave it alone and treat the inflammation until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the procedure on it with the same method until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the bulging tear duct flesh is causing significant harm to the eye, it should be suspended with a hook and cut from it its portion; do not go beyond this incision lest there be damage to the tear ducts.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then put drops into the tear duct of red saffron, or made from cornflower, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the incision for Al-Guaradi's disease and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes a red flesh grows or forms in certain human eyes until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or contracts above the eyelids; and is like a wild pomegranate.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And there is also an operation for it: the patient must put their head on your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes and gather all that flesh with appropriate hooks; hold it with a pair of forceps or pincers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first until its entirety is finished with a scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	Beware of the eye during this operation so that you do not harm it; let your cut be either with a knife or a chisel, which we mentioned in the nail incision: or with small scissors like those used to trim hoofs according to what will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete and all of the cataract has been removed, fill the eye with crushed salt; or distill into it red powder, and similar corrosive medicines; then place on top of the eye a fresh sheep's bladder (inside out), so that it may be sealed from the hot pus.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If there is any cataract remaining and you have hot blood and fear a hot pus, then leave the eye alone, and treat it with something that will ease the swelling.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Next, operate on it again until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	Do likewise with additional flesh that may happen to occur in the eye from this kind of injury.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, when it comes to treating any eye disease that occurs naturally or accidentally and requires an iron instrument for surgery: do not put your hand into any of these operations until you have seen whether the member can endure such a procedure.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On extracting Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red veins that grow on the eye, impeding its sight and weaken it over time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	You must first determine whether the eye with Sebel is strong and otherwise healthy apart from these veins; then collect its Sebel.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is right to instruct the patient to lay their head on your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then lift the veins with one hook or two according to your judgment; let the hooks be fine and doubled over like this form, or two joined on a single body as here.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then carefully collect with fine scissors those veins, and wipe away the blood every hour until you see those veins move out of sight and dissolve; be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your procedure be done at midday in the sun, and be very firm in your operation; so that you cut only those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then distill into the eye either green or red ointment so that its sharpness may dissolve what remains of the sebaceous matter.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if you cannot collect all of it in that hour, then apply to the eye a plaster with something in it to relieve the pain; and leave it there for several days until its pain is settled; and let it be bound by a warm poultice; afterwards repeat on it the same procedure until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On reducing arietta to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call Arietta a fistula which you treat with the cautery or with caustic medicine according as its history may have preceded.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not healed then there is no skill in it unless you make an incision over the abscess at its origin and extract all of the moisture that is in it along with the pus until bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore bone is exposed and you see on it signs of decay or blackness then scrape it with an instrument whose form is this:
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called asperation of the bone.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	The tool should be made of hardened iron, and its head should be round like a whetstone, marked with fine grooves either by a file or an engraver's tool; place it on the damaged bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand for a moment until you feel that the damage has been smoothed away; do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the area with drying, astringent medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If the area becomes firm and flesh grows there, and the course of the infection is cut off, and it remains so for forty days without any renewal or swelling, nor does anything untoward happen to it; then you may know that it has now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no other treatment except to bring the fistula back out through the nostril, following this pattern.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is done by exposing the second bone with a sharp iron or medicine; and when you have exposed that bone, take an auger like this one, its tip being of iron, triangular in shape; and its wood should be like a pyramid, tapering to the end as shown here.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it over that bone, close to the tear duct; and extend your hand a little away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the auger until it penetrates the bone and feels weak; through this you will know that air is escaping from it when they hold their hand over their nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	So then restore the area with astringent drying medicines as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When flesh grows and the area hardens, then any matter that used to escape outwards now returns to the nose; so it is lighter over the weak spot.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	The treatment for a protruding eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye bulges with all its parts and there is no damage to vision or diminution of sight, then one must cure the weak person by first bleeding them; afterwards place cups on their neck without scarring but using suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then apply to the eye a poultice made of acacia, aloe, frankincense, and storax.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	After that compress the eye from above with many soft feathers.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of applying the feathers is as follows: take many soft cloths and fold each one four times; make a stack of these then place them on top of each other according to how much the eye requires; finally, secure them firmly with a hard cloth bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the cups with suction without scarring.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	After that remove the cups and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the bandage softens again then it must be tightened repeatedly; afterwards remove the bandage after a day and night as I've said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	When you see the eye has returned to its proper skin it's good; if not then repeat the poultice and feathers and bandage and cups until cured.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	The treatment for a cut of the skin's membrane.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When there is a rupture of the membrane of the skin and it protrudes outside the eyelids like a grain of wheat, disfiguring the appearance of the person and requiring an incision to be made then surgery on that is as follows, which I will describe: you should insert a needle at the base of the membrane from below towards above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle into which is placed double thread from the tear duct side, and make it penetrate; and remove the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of double thread and tie it to a portion of the eyelid around the needle; then tighten it greatly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the needle and place over the eye wool soaked in white of egg; then leave it until the thread falls out with the eyelid.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the eyelid is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth until the eye becomes greatly prominent.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then the eye should be pierced with a fine spatula that reaches down to the depth of the eye; let moisture run into the white of the eye and the eye shall return in immediately; then tighten it until the wound heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the cure of alcomania.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness which is called alcomania is nothing but pus that accumulates in the eye, like water running down, and it itself is not water.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the manner of operating on it is to make the patient sit on a prepared seat or upright.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in both your hands and move it until you see the pus reach below his eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is tied up so that it does not fall and the eye is cleared; and the patient sees things as he used to see them: and if it has not fallen below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If, however, the descent of pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin spatula, and scrape with it over the hard crust for a little while near where the connective tissue joins the hard crust until pus appears.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it appears, then drop into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water that descends into the eye or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken about the types of water in the section, and what is suitable for boring; now take that same according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then you must make the patient sit square between your hands opposite a light near the sun; and tie his healthy eye shut, pulling it tight; then with your right hand hold down the eyelid of his eye if it is the left eye that has water in it; or with your left hand if it is the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take in your right hand an almond if it is the left eye; or in your left hand if it is the right eye.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the almond near the edge where the white of the eye appears around the size of a spoke; then push with force on the almond; and you turn your hand with it until it penetrates the white of the eye: and feel that the almond has now reached an empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary for the length of the needle to reach the depth [of the wound], and its width should be from the pupil to the end of the black part, which is the iris.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see them in the pupil itself due to the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the needle up to the spot where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards with force, one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If the water then descends immediately, the patient will see what is opened before his sight and the needle in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a short while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If the water descends again, then remove it for a second time, except that the needle is withdrawn.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it stops moving, but doesn't rise, then extract the needle with ease, and you turn your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some clear rock salt in the water, and wash the eye thoroughly with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place over the eye a whole piece of linen cloth or woolen material steeped in rose oil and white of egg; bind the sound eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, however, and those of our time, place over it powdered cumin with white of egg.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the needle doesn't yield to you in entering the eye because of its hardness; for it is made of iron, whose eye [i.e., sight] is very hard; then you must take a spatula called an *alberid*, which has this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Pierce therefore only its joint, and do not push your hand into the hole; it is enough to make a path towards the almond-shaped spot.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almond-shaped instrument as we have described.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And when your work is complete, prepare for the patient a decently made bedroom in which they can sleep on their back in a dark room; prohibit any movement or coughing; provide them with food that soothes their nature; and ensure they do not move their head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage remain in place according to its arrangement for three days.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in the dark room and test his vision; make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	It should not be done at the time of treatment or immediately after the incision; instead, it must be avoided because water rises quickly through a strong current.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a hot abscess occurs, then you should loosen the eye before the seventh day; and treat it with something that will calm the abscess until it is calmed; then restore his vision and place an eye mask over his face to regulate his sight for several days while he remains in the dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then they should leave the house gradually and return to their homes.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And you should know that a student is not exempt from vision training at the zaltea; for then he will dare to perform operations.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now a certain person from Alayrach has reached us who said that there was a woman in Alayrach with a perforated stomach from which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of appearances from a woman, as she stands upon it who is ignorant of it.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from pure brass; and their ends should have the same triangular delicacy, with an acute point.
Formae magda.	The form of a woman.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the treatment of nasal polyps.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes there grow in the nose various polyps, one of which resembles a many-legged scorpion; and from this arises a polyp that is hard like a stone, dark coloured, cancerous; and from it also arises one that is soft, not dark coloured.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	For the soft polyp, which is neither deceitful nor cancerous, you should make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun, and open his nostrils; then throw a hook into those polyps; next draw them out, and cut what you have seized of them with a thin sharp scalpel on one side until you know that all the flesh is now removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	But if anything of it should remain which cannot be removed; then shave it with one of the delicate instruments with ease until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood dominates you or a hot abscess develops, then oppose it with what is necessary: if it is one of the malignant abscesses, proceed to cauterize it until the blood stops flowing and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then after the incision, vinegar should be thrown into the nostril followed by water or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If the nostril opens up and moisture begins to come out of it all the way to the palate, then you will know that they are already healthy again.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If the moisture does not penetrate as it should then you will know that flesh has grown within its depths around the upper nasal bones which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	You should then introduce a piece of linen thread of a certain thickness with many knots along it and leave between each knot the length of a finger or less: and have the sick person put one end of the thread in their nose as far as possible after you make it similar to an arrow: and they pull on its smell until it comes out at their throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many children do something similar to this as a trick in school: and it is an easy thing for whoever wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then take the two ends of the thread: one that comes out over the nose and another which remains within it.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then take the flesh clamp and fix its teeth to the knots on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is now attached to the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread and put into the nose after washing away the blood lint that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days or more until all of the remaining flesh is eaten away by the ointment.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place a lead pipe in the end of the thing into the nose for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it requires treatment that dries it up, use this.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making the nasal douche with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it out of silver or brass; let it be similar to a small lamp, open like a seashell; and its nozzle likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish make the pipe closed, like a cane.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the small seashell of the instrument for making a nasal douche should be full and open: it should have a handle at its end with which you hold it when heating oil or whatever liquid in it that you want.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the treatment of nasal polyps.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many times there appears at the end of the nose a polyp that grows larger with time until it disfigures its appearance.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that it is necessary to attack it at the beginning of its appearance and eradicate all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put over the place either a caustic substance or a burning medicine that stays in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore you delay its excision until it grows larger, then consider whether it is of stony hardness and dark-coloured with little sensation; then do not touch it with the iron, for it is a cancerous ulcer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Many times I have seen someone who cuts out such an ulcer and a great harm befalls the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	If the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the patient's fluids, and make the incision without fear or hesitation: treat the area with a drying and constricting agent until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On sewing together the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when there is a break of continuity in one of these cartilages, surgery will not be of much help, except in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something like this happens to someone, you should consider whether it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture; afterwards treat it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of a break in continuity are already separated and each side has healed over, then you must scrape away all the tissue down to the bleeding flesh.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Afterwards bring the two lips together with a suture and tighten them; sprinkle over it powdered dragon's blood and ground frankincense; put on top of these powders a piece of fine wax plaster, and another of the harder consolidating plasters; leave this bound up for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then remove the bandage and change the dressing; leave it until the threads come away by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Afterwards treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of sewing is that you bring together the break in continuity either with needles as we described for the abdomen; or bring it together using thread as I have made you aware.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of lip nodules.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Hard nodules resembling grains of grass often occur for many people on the inner parts of their lips; some are smaller while others are larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, you must turn back the lip and cut above all of its nodules; suspend it with a hook and then slice through it on all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Next fill the place after incision with ground gallic nettle until it stops bleeding.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Afterwards it should be washed with vinegar; the wound site is to be treated with an astringent until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the excision of excess flesh over the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many times excess flesh grows over the gums; this is what the ancients call abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It is necessary to hook it or grab with forceps and cut at its base; allow blood (or pus) to run from the wound.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Afterwards apply ground gallic nettle or other drying astringent powders to the wound.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If this flesh returns following treatment, as it often does, then cut away a second time and cauterize; for it will not return after being burnt.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On tooth extraction with an iron tool.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough, ugly layers of enamel accumulate on the inner and outer surfaces of teeth and between the gums; sometimes they darken and become yellow and green until corruption reaches the gum from it, making teeth foul-looking.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should make the patient sit between your hands and rest his head on your lap; then scrape away the enamel as well as any part of it that looks like grit in a millstone; do this until no trace is left, and treat blackness, yellowness and greenness similarly until they are cleaned off.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If you remove the cause of these conditions early on, that's good; if not, repeat your treatment every day for two or three days until finally you reach where it is you want to get at.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	Also be aware that you will need scalpels of different shapes and sizes for preparing the tooth before your treatment; since the scalpel used to scrape off its lower surface is not the same as the one used to clean between teeth, given their differing forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And have these various types of scalpel ready for use as you see fit.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On toothache extraction.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You must relieve the tooth of its pain with all your skill, but be slow to extract it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For once it is extracted, there can be no replacement; so significant a thing is lost; unless there's simply no other option but to extract it, then you should strengthen and reassure the patient about the offending tooth when forced to pull it out.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Frequently, pain deceives the sick person, and they think that the ache is in a healthy tooth and pull it out; then the pain does not subside until the sick tooth is pulled.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the practice of blood-letters.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	So when the sick tooth is certified by you, then it is necessary that you sacrifice at the vicinity of the tooth with a spatula having some virtue, until the gum is loosened from every part; then move the tooth with your fingers or with thin forceps especially little by little, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in a good position there, and put the head of the sick person between your knees; which you have held well so that it does not move; then draw the tooth according to its straight line so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out then take one of those instruments and insert it under the tooth from every part gently, and try its movement as you did before.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is perforated or corroded then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth; and bind it with the end of a thin stick so that it does not break at the time of your tightening over it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you must take great care with the scarification around the gum from every part.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength so as not to break it and leave a part of the tooth which will return to the sick person with an evil pain greater than at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware of doing what ignorant blood-letters do in their haste and boldness over pulling it out, besides administering what we have narrated.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	They often inflict upon people serious injuries that are difficult to treat; either because some or all of the roots remain after it is broken, or when they remove it along with certain jaw bones - we have witnessed this many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	It should then be boiled after its removal with wine or vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If there is any bleeding from the wound (which often happens), grind some zegi and fill the wound with it; if this does not work, cauterise it instead - unless you do not have any zegi available.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The handles of the dental forceps should be long and short-handled, with thick heads so that they do not bend when pressed against a tooth; you can make these thicker at the handle to prevent them from crossing over each other as you close them: make the ends of the handles broad as well, such that even if you clamp down on them very hard, they will not cross over or damage one another. The ends should be made out of good iron and not cheap steel; the heads should have teeth which lock together tightly without slipping when clamped down with force.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the heads of the handles are made in the form of a bird's beak, like that of a stork, with a strong, firm grip.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth, and extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	If any fragments remain after a broken tooth is removed, pack the site with butter for one or two days to soften it; then insert either an alum plug or forceps whose ends are shaped like a stork's beak into this softened area and extract.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This is the form of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their ends should be made like a rasp inside; or like the claw of a cat.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not obey you at the exit with these forceps, then it is necessary for you to hollow out over the root, and remove all of the flesh, and insert the instrument which is named small Palanca, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the end be short, somewhat thick; and let it not be sharp so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root exits through it, that is good; and if not, you should help with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first is triangular at its end, on which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the second is triangular at its end, but thin.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It may also be aided with this instrument which has two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that have been mentioned previously in relation to teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	There is also assistance with this instrument which resembles a large hook, of this form, twisted triangular end, on which there is some thickness so that it does not break; and let it be blunt so that it does not sharpen.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for teeth; and similarly the other instruments are not counted, and a wise craftsman, skilled in his art invents by himself an instrument according to what is indicated by the operation itself and the illnesses themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because for diseases to which the ancients did not say any instruments, due to the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If a bone of the jaw or any other bones of the mouth breaks or becomes infected, then examine it carefully where it is located and use whatever tool suits its extraction from among the instruments and forceps that I mentioned in the section on tooth extraction; this one has the following form.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Place a thick material in it gradually so that the bone is clamped or held fast and does not fall out or slide until the bone comes out; then restore the site with suitable medicines for such an injury.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is some decay on the bone then remove it along with its decay; treat it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the removal of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth grow out of their normal path and direction, it becomes a deformity; especially when this occurs in the case of women and girls with fine features.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, one must take into account the following...
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	If a tooth is born after another and does not have its own place, or if it cannot be extracted or filed; then remove it instead by cutting into it with this instrument...
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small beak; its end is made of hard iron, very sharp.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision on it be over many days; this is due to the hardness of the tooth and so that others may not be shaken out by it.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If the prominent tooth is exposed to filing then file it with this iron file; its form is as follows...
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	The tooth shall be removed entirely with a tool of gold; its handle should have fine points like the file used to make needles - which is how it will gradually reduce the tooth over many days easily so that the tooth isn't shaken and falls out, then ease it gently and finally scrape it with small scalpels.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is a tooth from which part has broken and damages the tongue, then you must also file it until its roughness from that break is removed and becomes even; smoothen it, so that it will not hurt the tongue or corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On removing teeth with gold wire.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth suffer from concussion and shaking due to a blow or fall; and when the patient is unable to chew on them for fear of losing their food; and if you have treated them with astringent medicines without success, then it's time to bind these teeth together using gold wire. Silver will turn green and rot within days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	The wire should be of a thickness and thinness according to the size that fits between teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	The technique is to take the wire and insert half of it between two healthy teeth; then weave its two ends among the loose tooth or teeth until you reach with your thread up to a sound tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weave until you reach back to where you started; and tighten your grip with skill and wisdom so that it's not at all removable: your tightening of the wire should be at the roots of the teeth so as not to come out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excessive gum with scissors: gather both together and turn them over with forceps; hide them between a healthy tooth and one that has been moved so as not to harm your tongue, then leave the thread tight while you do this.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it loosens or is cut, tighten them with another thread and this will keep them in place during the whole process.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the arrangement of teeth, showing the positioning of two healthy teeth and two moved teeth as you can see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return after falling out and are retained in their places as we have described; they remain like this unless the skilled and experienced dentist removes them.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes some bone splinters are fitted and made into the shape of a tooth; it is placed where the missing tooth was located and secured as we have said before; it remains like this for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	§ On cutting the ligament under the tongue which prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament under the tongue is either natural, with which one is born, or accidental from an injury that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	The procedure for this is to open the mouth of the patient and place it in your lap; then lift their tongue; next cut through that sinewy ligament until the tongue is freed from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is any hardness or knotting within it and this comes from the healing of a wound; then thrust a hook into it and move it sideways until you cut through the ligament and free up that knot.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And take care that there is no fissure deep within the flesh, and you do not cut into an artery there, causing a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then it should be washed around the track of the incision with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue lint from linen that the patient should hold through every night so it does not heal a second time.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If, however, there is a flow of blood, then place on the spot ground ginger.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If blood prevails over you, then cauterise the spot with a lunar cautery suitable for this; afterwards treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of a ranula which forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes there happens under the tongue a boil resembling a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural movement; and perhaps it grows so much that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation for this is to open the patient's mouth towards the sun, then examine the boil.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	So if you see it is dark or black in colour, hard and without sensation to the patient's touch then do not touch it for it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it slopes towards whiteness with some moisture then thrust into it a curved hook and cut it out with a sharp spoon-shaped instrument and remove it whole.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood prevails over you during your work then place on it ground ginger until the bleeding is checked; then return to your work until you remove it and all of its covering.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be rinsed with vinegar and salt: and treat it with any other suitable treatment until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat and jaw, that is, glands which resemble cotton, which happen outside; and they are called two tonsils: when you treat them with what we have said in the section on division, and they do not heal, then consider this.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is a hard abscess, of a dark colour, with little feeling: then do not touch it with the iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red colour, and its root is thick: then do not touch it either with the iron, fearing an outflow of blood, rather leave it until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then you will either pierce it through; or it should burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white colour, round in shape, and its root is thin: then you must cut into it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is, that you consider before its treatment, if the abscess has become quiet while warm and complete, or diminished to some extent: then make the patient sit facing the sun, and let their head be in your lap; and open their mouth, and have someone take this instrument between their hands and press the patient's tongue down with it, which is of this shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	It shall be made of silver or brass, which should be thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press with it on the tongue, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it into the tonsil, and draw it out as far as you can towards the exterior, except that you do not pull anything of the tunic with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument that has this shape which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It resembles scissors; however, its ends are curved so that the opening of each is at a right angle to the other and is sharp; hence ensure it is made from iron or hardened bronze.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatuli whose form is thus.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It should be sharp on one side but not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And when you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in exactly the same way.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is bleeding have the patient gargle with water in which boiled gallnut bark; or myrtle leaves and similar astringents until the blood flow ceases; then treat it until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes there appear other abscesses in the throat besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut them then as I have said for cutting of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	For my part I have treated a woman for an abscess that had formed in her throat which was causing difficulty breathing and loss of sensation to the point that her throat was almost closed; and she could only breathe through a narrow opening, and was already unable to eat or drink water: and by now would have died if left another day or two.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	The abscess had risen so high that it had sent out two branches until they came out at the top of her nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore hurriedly made a stitch with one of those hooks.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and a large portion came away from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	I then cut that off where I found the hole of the nose.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did to it what came out from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	I then opened her mouth and pressed down on her tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess, then cut off part of it, and no more came from it except for some blood; so the woman's throat was healed, she immediately drank water and then took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease cutting out from the abscess many times over a long period; and an abscess would form in place of that which I had cut away, until it was extended too far and along with her.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore devised something, and I cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	I therefore refrained from adding anything further; then I went away from her side, and did not know what God would do with her after that.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On cutting out an abscess of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a catarrh descends to the uvula and becomes abscessed and elongated, then it is called "perpendicular"; and if it forms on the lower part of the uvula as a thick, round mass, then it is called a "tuba".
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When you treat it with what we have said above and the treatment does not take effect; and you see that there is an abscess which has gone away from her heat but remains soft; then you ought to cut this out.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And if it has formed a round mass and there is no length to it, and its colour is red or dark brown or black, and it lacks feeling; then you should make an incision in it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear over the sick person.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner that I have described regarding its colour and length, you should make the sick person sit facing the sun; then press their tongue with an instrument as previously mentioned; next, fix a hook into one ear and pull it downwards; finally, cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned for incising two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not cut anything from it unless what is added beyond the natural end without being included.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut more from it, you will damage their voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use what we described for incising two tonsils; and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	However, if the sick person is afraid of the incision, then you should use skill in cauterizing it without fear or anxiety.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	The method of cauterizing it does not involve anything but cold water; you should place the sick person's head in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press their tongue with the instrument that we mentioned earlier.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Next, take some of the water that I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and make a paste with it using unquenched lime; ensure it is neither thick nor thin, and fill the hollow of this instrument with it, which has this shape:" (at this point the original text includes an illustration).
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	The end of it should have a concave shape, like the concavity of the handle of a spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	Place the instrument with the medicine on top of that wound; and let the patient lie on their side so saliva flows out from their mouth away from the medicine inside it so nothing runs down into their throat to hurt them.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with medicine in it.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And keep it there for half an hour until you see the wound turning black and the medicine calming down from its initial agitation.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to use a plug then wrap it with lint around the end of the radius and dip this lint-plug into medicine before inserting the radius (with lint-plug attached) into its tube until the lint plug adheres well onto that wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times over until you achieve the desired degree of cauterization for that wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it be; for within three to four days it will dry up and fall off by itself.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to apply more medicine then do so; and after the cauterization has been done clean around that wound with a lint-plug soaked in butter and wipe off any remaining medicine from its surroundings, then wash it all down with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	It should be treated from outside by means of poultices as well as internally with mouthwashes until it has completely healed up.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This kind of treatment is healthier than cutting (i.e., the lancet) as well as less frightening to be around.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes a wound is even healed by means of something finer than either cautery or incision; it is healed with the aid of fumigations in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamentum, hyssop, oregano, rue, seah, chamomile, abrotanum, and similar herbs; gather all of them or some of them in a pot, submerge them with vinegar, and boil; the pot must be glazed with decent clay; there should be a hole in the middle of the pot on top of which is placed an instrument shaped like this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	It shall be made of silver or bronze; the end with the pomegranate design is to be inserted into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the small bowl above the tube until the bowl becomes very cloudy.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times until it dries.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware not to make this cure at the beginning of an abscess's appearance.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it often adds to the abscess; one should not do this unless at the decline of an abscess's warmth.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If this tool is not available to you, then take a tube and place goat skin at its end so the patient's mouth will not get burnt as the goat skin prevents the vapor from burning; this is an excellent cure with success.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On extracting splinters and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often there gets stuck in the throat bone, or fish spine, or another object.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	One should therefore extract what is visible of it above that which falls on sight after you press the tongue with an instrument towards the sun and identify to yourself what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And if it is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps it will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the patient should swallow a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or they should swallow a mouthful of dry bread; or take a piece of dry, soft sponge seaweed and tie it up with thread before swallowing.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	Once it reaches the place where there is a thorn or bone, and it comes out, then it will be removed.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore, it does not come out with what we have said, then use a lead instrument in this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	It should be thicker than a spoke by a little bit and at its end it should have a curve that can easily be inserted into the throat when their head is raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And be careful not to touch their epiglottis so that it does not cause them to cough and push the bone or thorn with it, or let the doctor insert it by hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	However, it is better for the patient to insert it themselves because of their knowledge about where the object is located; and they should push downwards or pull upwards with their hand while holding the instrument until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On extracting leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is treated with what I have mentioned in the section on treatment using medicine and it does not improve then look at the patient's throat in front of the sun or towards the sun after you press their tongue down with the instrument that I described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your sight falls upon a leech, remove it with a small hook or with thin tweezers deftly.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with these [tools]: then take a hollow tube, and insert it into the throat of the patient close to the esophagus; next, insert into the cavity of the tube a red-hot iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this several times, and let the patient refrain from drinking water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he should take a cup filled with cold water and open his mouth into it; let him gargle his mouth with it but not swallow any of it; then move the water around in his mouth once an hour for another hour with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech will immediately drop off when it senses water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs or leeches with the instrument I mentioned for fumigating a cold.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this several times, since it will fall off.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operating with fumigation is such that you take a pot containing live plums over fire; and let this pot be covered by a lid where there is a hole in its middle, and let an end of the instrument be fixed into it.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then direct the fumigation and let the patient put his mouth on an end of the tube and close his mouth so that no smoke escapes until you know that the smoke has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately drop off.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall out, then repeat fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the patient bear thirst, eat salty things, garlic, and onions, but not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary that he depart with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is removed from the throat, when it falls upon it with its eye.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like a pair of forceps, as you see; except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file; when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	### Concerning the opening of abscesses, their incision, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many types of abscesses, of many forms, according to the manner in which they come about; this will be discussed further when we treat of one kind herein; and there are differences as regards the manner in which they should be lanced or opened with two methods.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of these is of the kind of abscess within itself which contains moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	The second method concerns the places on the body where they occur.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since an abscess occurring on the head is different from one that occurs in the anal region; and since an abscess in soft tissue is different from one which arises at a joint, each of these requires its own judgment as to treatment.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from inflammations are those which should not be punctured unless after the maturation of pus in them and its completion; and among them are those that must be punctured while they are raw and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as inflammations that are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an inflammation when it occurs near a joint, and its duration is prolonged until what is inside it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; this is the cause for the closer proximity of the contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an inflammation in a principal limb; because if you delay its puncturing until it matures, it will harm either that limb or the principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore puncture it while it is immature; and you should not puncture a raw inflammation that has not completed digestion unless it is near the anus so as to prevent the putrefaction of its depth and prolonging towards the interior of the anus, and for there not to be a fistula or non-healing in its termination.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You must know the time of puncturing an inflammation that has matured according to its completion; and this is at the relief of pain, reduction of fever, and decrease in redness, throbbing, and sharpness of the head of the inflammation; as well as other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you must make the same puncture at the lowest point of the inflammation and its most prominent peak; and let the puncturing go along the length of the body if inflammations are in parts of hands or feet, and places of forearms, cords, nerves, arteries, and finally all equal locations that do not have a reflex.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	Go with a suture along that member according to its perforation.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When however the abscess is in fleshy parts: then it is better that you leave its opening alone until its discharge has been completed as we have said according to what follows.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you open it before this, the course of the pus from it is prolonged and there is much dirt and nastiness, and perhaps its lips will harden and its depth increase.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are opened according to the width of its body for what is needed or according to that part which requires it.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you make a small opening for small abscesses and a large one for large ones or several cuts according to the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses in which it is necessary to cut away the skin and incise when already formed like a cloth and has reached its limit because now it is dead such as happens with many ulcers and swellings.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And of these some are incised by an incision having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there is one of them which is incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an abscess of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them there are those in which you make a round incision or a lunar one and incisions similar to these.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which has no head like soft superficial abscesses must be opened by a superficial or flat incision only.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the abscess is large and has already collected a lot of pus, and you puncture it, do not rush to extract all the pus at that moment; instead, remove only a portion from within.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then neglect the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times in stages until it is gone; especially if the patient is weak and feeble, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit man: for frequently the animal spirit of one animal dissipates along with the discharge of pus; and perhaps the patient may die without you realizing.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, exercise great caution in this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your puncture of the abscess with this instrument, you must clean the wound; and take note.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If the wound of the abscess is small or it is a flat cut, then apply lint made from linen, or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	But if the abscess is large and there are many punctures, then you must insert lint into each puncture until they meet one another.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the abscess you have cut away a piece of skin or you have scooped it out around its edges, then you must fill this with old cotton, or like when you weave cloth, or scrape with linen wool without moisture; and bind it tight until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then wash it clean and take care of it with whatever ointment is required until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If there is a flow of blood during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after soaking a cloth in them; place it on the bleeding site multiple times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If the bleeding persists, you must apply a diet, treatment, and powders that I have described in many places throughout this book and its sections.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is winter time and the site of abscess involves many nerves; then you must apply small poultices made with warm wine and oil on these areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is summer and the areas are fleshy; then you must apply poultices soaked in water and oil or wine and oil, making sure everything is cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Keep doing this until the third day, as mentioned before, then you must open the abscess, clean it and apply treatment suitable for it until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This, therefore, is what is necessary for the general knowledge of abscess treatment.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	Following the path of this book's structure, I have already described every type of abscess and how to treat each one in detail.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	## On the treatment of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Abscesses that occur on the skin of the head are small and similar to nodules; they contain cysts which resemble chicken pouches.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many types of these abscesses.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Among these are the fatty tumors; and among them are those which contain moisture resembling mud; and among them are those containing moisture like mincemeat and poultices; also such as resemble these; and there are among them hard stony ones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the operation on all these growths, and their removal there is no danger provided that during the operation upon them the artery does not present an obstacle.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their excision consists of exploring them with an instrument whose form is given below and which is called a trocar until you know what they contain.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture then cut it open by an incision lengthwise along the surface in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin the incision from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated then scrape out the cyst which contains that moisture and do not leave any of it behind.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it frequently returns if any part of it is left behind.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is available; and if not then in water and salt; and fill with it the wound, and leave it till the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it eats away what remains of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it the Egyptian ointment a second and third time; and if you require it then continue till you are confident that there is no part of the cyst remaining: then treat the wound with any sort of ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	But if the abscess contains a fatty tumour then cut it open in this form with an incision having the shape of a cross; and throw hooks between the lips of the incision, and scrape it out on all sides: and endeavour your strength at extracting the capsule which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however the artery presents an obstruction to you, then do what I shall tell you after this.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do likewise for an abscess if it is of the stony type, by incision and cure with the same treatment as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision above a stony abscess is easier because there is little blood or moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses which occur on the head in some people where moisture is completely absent.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	This is because I incised an abscess on the head of a woman, an old lady, and found that the abscess was like a solid hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; indeed if anyone struck it with their finger they would wound themselves.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	However, with other types of abscesses occurring on the head except these types that occur on children's heads and at the roots of their ears, the incision should be a shallow one for all such cases.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make the perforation of them always from their lower part so that you may ease the course of the pus downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then cure it with whatever is suitable to their treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the incision of goitres on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur on the neck, under the shoulders and hips, but sometimes they are found elsewhere in the body too.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	Those of this type which occur on the neck can be a single growth or several; they breed from one another and each goitre among them has its own membrane like a skin just as is seen with knots and abscesses in the head, as we described earlier.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	There are many types of these tourniquets.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And some of them are made of stone; others contain moisture; yet others are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, for that one among them which you see to be of a good disposition on touch, whose colour is close to that of the skin, and it moves with every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck nor to the muscles nor to the artery, nor does it lie deep: it ought to be cut by a superficial incision from the upper body to the lower body along the line b. to g., and scrape it all over; and stretch out two lips of skin with a hook or many hooks if you need them, as we said in head abscesses, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And caution must be taken not to cut into any veins or nerves.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the knife be not too sharp, so that it does not give you difficulty in cutting and disturb the patient and cut into what is unnecessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut into a vein or artery and it prevents you from operating then apply to the wound some caustic rubbed down to powder, or certain powders which check blood, and bind up the wound and let it alone until the severity of the abscess has subsided, and the wound softens; otherwise it begins to decay.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is checked by caustic substances; so return to your operation until you have finished it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then feel with your index finger whether there remains anything of the other small tourniquets; therefore cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if there is a large vein at the root of the tourniquet then you ought not to cut that tourniquet from its root but rather you should tie it with strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without causing harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then treat yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire strophulus is cut off, then you should bring together the two lips of the wound and sew them immediately once you see that there is no more superfluity remaining.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is superfluity remaining because of the size of the strophulus, then it's necessary to aim at cutting its root and extracting it, and then administer the suture we described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And for those strophuli that contain moisture, pierce it with a shallow puncture so its maturity site becomes apparent to you; and place the puncture below what follows from the body, as we described.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer lint dressed with ointment and similar to it after the puncture, so that what remains of the corruption is corroded away until you see the wound now cleansed; then treat yourself with generative flesh-forming ointment until it's healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the excision of the epiglottis from an abscess inside the throat that occurs.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients called this excision of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it; and here is their description of the operation.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those with synanche, the excision of the epiglottis should be avoided as it is of no benefit due to all the veins and lung being compromised.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	However, for those with a hot abscess in the mouth or throat or on both tonsils but without illness of the gullet, the excision of the epiglottis should be performed to escape destruction from suffocation that may result.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	We should therefore, when we wish to do so, cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across its width, at the point between two circles in length, which is an incision into the soft tissue and not into the cartilage; and this indeed is a suitable place for the incision, since it lacks flesh, and blood vessels from there are distant.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, he should then stretch out the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should slit the skin until he reaches the canal; let him avoid blood vessels if he sees any of them there.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the soft tissue as described; and the incision of the canal is indicated by the flow of phlegm that comes out from it along with what has been ruptured, and the loss of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour is removed at which suffocation is feared, bring together the two lips of the skin wound and stitch it solely by itself without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then apply medicines that cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis says so.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this speech we have related is not an explanation unless they see that one of these abscesses has already filled the throat of the sick person; and the patient is raised up to death, and wishes to be cut through in his panting: they proceed to cutting the epiglottis so that the patient may breathe on the place of the wound with a certain breath, and may be saved from death. And for this reason they have ordered the leaving open of the wound until the malignancy of the illness is consumed; and its malignancy is three days, or almost itself: then therefore they have ordered to stitch the wound, and to cure it until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I witnessed was that one female servant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, thereby cutting through a part of the pulmonary canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	I was called to treat her, and I found that she was moaning like the moan of a dying person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore examined the wound and found that very little blood had come out of it.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was therefore confused because she had not severed the vein or artery: yet air was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore prepared some warm water and cleaned the wound until it was healthy; and nothing happened to the female servant except that she had a hoarseness in her voice, and after several days she returned with an improved condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	From this I say therefore: there is no fear in the incision of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On cutting an oesophageal hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess named Oesophageal hernia is a large one, according to the colour of the body, and it occurs much more frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	It occurs in two ways: either naturally or accidentally.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly it is not natural genius.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	It is accidental, however, in two ways: one of which resembles fatty lumps.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to an abscess that forms from arterial pulsation.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And it carries risk, and one should not presume to operate on it with an iron instrument, unless for a minor procedure; and you must first try it out, and investigate its interior using the introducer.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If you find it similar to a fatty tumor and not suspended by any of the veins, then cut it out as tumors are cut; and remove it together with whatever contents there are from the cyst, if it is in a cyst; or otherwise, then explore its entirety.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the site with what is required for healing, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On excision of superficial tumors:
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of tumors and I have already said all their types in the classification; it is necessary for me to explain here the difference between a tumor and an excrescence since this causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore that when there is an excrescence, there is heat and fever, with violent pains until the boiling overflow of corruption subsides and is completed; then indeed do the fevers and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But with a tumor there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains; and they are contained by a cyst or sac which is their own case, and is of the color of the body; and its inception is like a chickpea, and it becomes like batecha, and is both larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two types: either fatty; or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the classification.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	You must therefore, when you come to treat a tumor, examine it and probe it first with the instrument called an introiterator, according to which its form will come in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of probing abscesses and all tumors is this: take up that instrument and insert it into the moistest spot, which you find in the abscess; then turn your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has now penetrated through the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then measure out your hand according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the introiterator and consider what comes out in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If, therefore, moisture flows out of it, whatever its colour may be; then dry it by a shallow incision, as I have said about other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes out in the track of the introiterator, then know that it is a fatty tumor; therefore dry it by an incision having the form of a cross, like this one, as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scrape off the skin all round gently: and keep a poultice over it if you can to draw out the disease with the tumour.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the poultice is burst at the operation and it is not possible to draw out the whole of the disease, which often happens, then cut away every bit of it till there remains nothing more of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if any part, small or great, remains, the tumour returns for the most part.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it gets the better of you and there still remains a bit of it; then fill up the wound at its close with some sharp corrosive powders: bind up the wound, and put on what sits over the abscess warm, and treat it by the rest of the cure till it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If it is a large cyst, then its two lips, and treat it with that which causes flesh to grow into it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if a pulsating or non-pulsating vein opposes you, then hurry and fill the place with pitch that has been pounded; leave it tight for two or three days until the wound becomes rotten and the boiling of blood subsides; then return to cut what remains of the cyst.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	The instruments necessary for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Among them are probes, which are of three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	Of these, there is one large, another medium-sized, and the third small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	They should be made of iron wires with square tips to facilitate their entry into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	These are the probes, that is, piercing instruments; and one of them is called beris, that is, the piercer, which is also of three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	Of these, there is one large, another medium-sized, and the third small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They agree to be used to investigate abscesses, ulcers, fistulas, and buboes by that which is made of bone among them.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	Others are made round, smooth, and soft like large needles with which cushions are stuffed: that is, from leather or brass or iron or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those made from leather.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	Probes are also made of black lead for use in exploring fistulas with rough surfaces to gently rub against those surfaces.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because from them there are long ones, from them medium ones, and from them short ones, according to the quantity of the length of the fistula and its stricture.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of splints, and they are of many types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because from them there are simple ones, that is to say those which have one curve; and they are of three types as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them there are blind splints; and they are of three types.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types; and from them there are hooks having three curves, and they also are of three types; and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut open and skinned; and they are of three types, because from them there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their cutting ends are sharp and their other ends are not sharp; and they are not applied like this unless with them help is provided in the skinning of nodes for fear of incision into a vein or nerve; and so that the sick person may be healed by means of them, and find some relief from the burning compared to what he finds when the abscess is skinned.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are scalpels of the large kind, and they are of three types.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of copper, and they are like a tube with which spirits are made; and at the wide end there is hidden a needle's point; and in it runs within to without as you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of splinters hidden between the toes due to the ulcerated perforations: and they are not perceived by the patient; these come in three types, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Shapes of tourniquets with which the flow of blood is cut off; they are three types: large, medium and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They shall be made of brass or bronze, rounded, slightly elongated as you see; they should be thin.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And you should have these types of tourniquets with you in large and small sizes; so that you can quickly stop the blood flow when needed, especially when no medicine is available.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them to stop blood flow from any part of the body; only in fleshy parts such as the calf of the leg, hip, forearm, breast, abdomen, groin and similar fleshy, moist areas.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	Sometimes small instruments are made in the same shape from thin strips of wood resembling almond shells; with which blood is stopped when it flows out of a phlebotomy site or after an incision into a vein or artery. Sometimes they're also made rounded like this.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the treatment of male breasts resembling those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the completion of sleep (that is when they begin to ejaculate during sleep) until they resemble those of women; and they remain ulcerated, ugly and sore.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore he who is disgusted by it should cut above the nipple with a crescent shaped incision in this form from b to g; then scrape off all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the wound with incarnative medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Next, bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the breast droops downwards and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it must be cut in two on its upper sides with two similar cuts in a moon-like shape, each one containing the other at either end, so that there is a larger line enclosing a smaller one, like this form from line b. to line g. Then scrape away the skin between the two lips and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about sutures and powders which are necessary for healing until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	But if you cannot complete the incision of what needs to be cut because of the patient's distress or bleeding: then you must fill the wound with a piece of corrosive ointment and leave it until it has eaten away any remaining fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the perforation of an abscess which happens under the armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which happen under the armpit are hard in nature and contain a collection of pimples or contain moist humours.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those which are of the moist type must be cut open with a moon-shaped incision like this form from line b to line g. When all the pus has been drained from the abscess then fill it with an old piece of cloth and leave it until the next day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	The wound should then be cleaned and treated with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the type known as strophulus, then it should be lanced over its surface, as we have said in the chapter on strophuli.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if the wound discharges pus, a caustic should be applied to it, as we said above.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the excision of an abscess which occurs between an artery and a vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is torn and the skin above it heals over, an abscess often forms; likewise with a vein, so that an abscess and swelling may occur therein.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	The signs by which it can be recognized that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and a vein are these: when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long and deep in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, there is almost a crepitation.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to the vein is round on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	The incision of this abscess is a mistake, especially that which occurs under the armpits, groins, neck and in many places on the body; it is extremely dangerous.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It should therefore be treated without the use of the knife, and even those which are on extremities or the head ought to be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	In that which is due to the swelling of an artery's orifice, make an incision lengthwise on the skin.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, afterward the artery: and free it from its sheaths until it is uncovered.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce beneath it a needle and make it penetrate to the other side; then ligature the artery with double thread in two places as I taught you for extracting two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place between the two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood which is there comes out and the abscess is discharged.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply a treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off; afterward treat it with suitable ointments until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If the abscess is due to a vein having been cut then you must hold with your hand as much of it as possible together with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce the needle under that place which you held with your hand and make it penetrate; and let there be on it double thread until you withdraw it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then ligature the abscess with it by means of a good ligature; as I told you for single ligaturing, from two sides with the two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you are afraid that the thread will be withdrawn then introduce another needle with another thread beneath the whole abscess near the wound of the first needle; press and ligature your threads at four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then slit the abscess down the middle until all that is inside comes out; then cut off the superfluous skin and leave what has been ligatured from it as it is.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put over it a poultice which you have steeped in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment, which is done with bandages and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	The abscess that occurs from nerve torsion.
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, similarly, an abscess can occur in nerves; this happens when they are struck or due to excessive effort, and similar things; it most often occurs in the regions of the assistants' [muscles] or calves, and in every place where joints move: and it is a severe abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its colour is similar to the rest of the body, and it appears in multiple shapes without pain; and when it is squeezed with force, one feels in it a numbness like giddiness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess collected deep within the body, but under the skin; and it moves to every side, and does not go forward or back towards the front, nor backwards towards the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	What then arises from them in joints should not be invaded with iron [a knife or blade].
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps contraction will occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	However, for that which is from them in the head or forehead, lift up the skin with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	So if it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it away from its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then lift it up with a hook and scrape it; afterwards remove it, and collect the wound with a suture; then treat it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the incision of an abscess that occurs on the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	There occur to some people frequently in their bellies and other parts of their bodies swellings which are called 'fungus', on account of their likeness to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root of which is fine and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there is some that are small; and there is some which grow to an extraordinary size.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have seen a man in whose belly were two swellings which more resembled fungi than other things: there was no difference between them except that the one had a white root and was smaller; and their lips were inverted and they discharged pus, and moisture flowed from them continually.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So I cut them out and found that one weighed about ten ounces and the other six. And when operating on them you should note that if the patient is moist of constitution and the colour of the swelling is white and it has a moist fine root, then you should cut it with a spatulate knife an inch wide; and have ready some cauteries in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For frequently much blood is discharged when it is cut into; so if the bleeding gets the better of you, then cauterize it at once.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	But if you see the patient fearful and timid about being cut with an iron knife, then take a thread well made of lead and bind it around the swelling in the manner which I have described; and leave it on for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add some caustic powder to the binding of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	So do not cease binding with lead whenever it bites into the swelling until it falls off by itself without further trouble.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If, however, the root of the tumor is large, then there is some fear and dread associated with making an incision into it; this is especially true for tumors located in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to cut it in half.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Treat the wound until it heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	Also be careful not to rush into cutting a tumor that is dark in color, has little feeling, and looks ugly; for it is indeed a cancerous abscess, and I shall come back with a reminder of Cancer later on.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of an umbilical hernia.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	An umbilical hernia forms for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	It occurs either because of a tear in the fascia above the abdomen through which protrudes an omentum or intestine, depending on what happens in other hernias.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows out of a vein or an artery, as has been mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from air trapped within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If it is due to a tear in the fascia and has an exit for feces, then it is the colour of an abscess-like body and is soft, pain-free, and appears at various sites.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the exit of an intestine, then its location will be of a more violent variety, as we have described above.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you therefore press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns and is perhaps accompanied by a sound; and it grows greatly upon entering the bath and with violent effort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is due to moisture, it is soft; then it is not concealed when you press it with your hand, neither constricted nor added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears blackening the skin.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is due to born flesh: then it is a grave abscess, large, hard, and swelling according to its quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is due to moisture, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, as you should then consider, if the navel's swelling is due to arterial blood, venous blood or moisture: then you ought to be restrained from its cure.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in it is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke of abscesses due to arteries and veins.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the navel's swelling is due to intestine or stomach: then you ought to advise the patient to hold their breath and stand stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with caustic around the navel's whole circumference.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards instruct them to lie on their back between your hands on their back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a broad spatula around the navel on the place you marked with caustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards extend towards higher parts from the middle of the abscess with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him around firmly with strong thread or a silk cord: and let the knot of the binding be slack.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess, extending above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you therefore find it already grasped by the ligament: then extract the ilex hook and insert your index finger into it, pushing the intestine towards the interior of the belly; and if you find a cecum, then take hold of it with a hook, and cut off its superfluity.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if the artery or vein is facing away from you: then grasp it firmly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	Take two needles and thread a strong thread through each; then insert the two needles into the circumference you made around the abscess, arranged like a cross, ensuring they penetrate [the skin].
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then draw the abscess together at four points above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, leaving an open area until the extended flesh becomes necrotic, and it falls away of its own accord; or cut it away when it is softening and becoming necrotic.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the umbilical hernia is made of flesh with an opening into it, or if it's fluid-filled; then you must make the abscess concave as we described above.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract any blood or fluid that you find inside it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat the hernia with what is appropriate to solidify the area.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	On the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already discussed the different types of cancer and how to treat them with medications; and we advised caution when treating it with iron instruments so as not to cause an ulceration; and we spoke about cancers that originate in the uterus and precautions against treating them.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is located in a place where its eradication is possible; such as cancer found in the breasts or hip, and similar locations on parts of the body which are easier to remove entirely; especially when it is small and just beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When however it has become old, and is large, you should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I myself could not heal anyone of it; nor have I seen any other before me who has reached it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the treatment for it, when located as we have said, is to proceed with purging the patient of black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then perform bloodletting if you find it with clear engorgement.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient for treatment, which should be done with care.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then apply hooks to pull out cancerous tissue.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Next, scoop it out from all sides with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and allow blood to flow without cutting quickly but by squeezing the areas and wiping off thick blood with your hand or any other suitable tool available.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however the flow of thick blood from an artery or vein presents a problem, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops flowing.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until cured.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the Treatment of Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we have described in the division of types of dropsy, and how the accumulation of water occurs: and all signs of each type, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is only the type of ascites; and it does not approach with iron for types tympanitis or hyposarcum, for this is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have been already treated this type of dropsy tympanitis with medicines, and it has not yielded to your treatment, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient has already developed weakness, or there is another illness besides dropsy, such as a cough, stomach problems, or similar; then beware of treating them with iron, for it is to be feared.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a patient with abundant strength, no other illness besides dropsy alone; and they are neither young nor old: then the method of treatment is for you to lift them up while standing between your hands, while an assistant behind them presses on their stomach with their hand, forcing water downwards.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a sharp spine, shaped like this.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It should have two pointed parts, be long, with the point like that of a spine.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	Yet let there be some shortening along it gradually so you do not pierce through to the intestine during treatment and injure it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider...
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the dropsy has originated from the intestines, then it is necessary that you make an incision three fingers long below the navel, leading downwards towards the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If the cause of hydropsy is disease of the liver then your cut should be three fingers to the left of the navel.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its cause is the spleen then your cut should be on the right side and it must also be on whichever side the patient wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not flow towards a weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the skin entirely with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that incision and raise your hand with a spatula between the skin, and scrape as if you are flaying it; and let what is scraped off be the size of a fingernail or thereabouts.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce that which has been scraped until the spatula reaches an empty space; this is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it and insert into the hole an instrument that is shaped like this: [diagram of an instrument].
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is like a cannula; it is made of silver or brass or gilded bronze, soft and clean; there is a small hole at its lower end, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side and one on the other: and its end is cut in such a way as to resemble the incision of a reed, as you see; at its upper end is an annular ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches water then it immediately sinks on top of the instrument; so evacuate from the water at once half a measure [of liquid].
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate more than is necessary then perhaps at that moment the patient will die due to loss of his animal spirit; or he will suffer a swoon which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Indeed, evacuate from it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what the dispositions of the patient indicate to you regarding the strength of their pulse and their good health.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is kept immediately next to the skin which retains the hole that is over the fistula: of which I have spoken, so that you may bore it according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the use of the instrument on the second day, if you see that the patient can tolerate it: and also remove a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there remains of the water only a small amount.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the patient, and let out a large amount of water: then treat it with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in the bath and the sun, and allow them to suffer thirst: and treat it with drying medications until they are healed: and cauterize over the stomach, flanks, and spleen after the extraction of water: according to what I have spoken about previously.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the treatment of children who are born with their urine passageways unperforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any child emerges from their mother's womb, and the head of their penis is unperforated, or has a narrow hole, or is in the wrong place...
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is therefore necessary to assist with its perforation immediately upon their birth using a very fine spatulam, in this form... [sketch omitted]
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a fine leaden peg in the hole and tie it; keep it there for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When he therefore wishes to emit urine, let it be removed, and let him urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then bring it back down.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the site will not allow it to close up.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He however whose hole is tight is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days until it becomes enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the hole is not in its proper place suffer harm.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because in those who are born the hole is at the end of the shaft; therefore they cannot urinate forwards until they raise the penis upwards with their hand.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is he able to generate offspring because the semen cannot reach the womb by going straight; and this is a very nasty disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operating on him is for the patient to lie prone on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then stretch the head of his penis with your left hand by a strong pull, and cut off the glans from the shaft at the junction with the frenum, either with a lancet or a sharp knife; as is the cutting of a reed, or like when you pare something so that its middle comes level with the glans; and so that the hole falls in the middle where it ought to be.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And take care during your procedure not to suffer from a bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	It often happens indeed.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Object therefore to him with that which cuts off the blood, and take care of the wound until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	§ Of phimosis that occur in the foreskin and glans penis, and of their corruption, blackening, and adherence.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These phimoses often occur on the penis and there is an ugly flesh bump.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from this some are malignant, and others not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore the non-malignant one must be hung up with a fine hook and cut it off until you clean all of it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place over it a poultice steeped in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Take care of it afterwards with Dyaphygin ointment until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	But if the phimosis is malignant, ugly-colored, you must apply a caustic to it after its excision and scraping.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If however the phimosis is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and part of it is inside, and a part outside; then you must remove that which is inside first until it heals up, then treat what's on the outside: because when you heal both together, the foreskin will not be healed without being perforated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And these things happen also with the testicles, blackening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	It is therefore necessary for you to hollow out all that has already turned black, or what is about to be corrupted, and what is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then sprinkle on top of it after that with honey which has already been shaken up with flour from pomegranate skins and herbs that have been crushed and sifted.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	But if there should be an outflow of blood, then apply the caustic with a lunar caustic, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	The caustic is indeed useful for two conditions at the same time, namely an outflow of blood and a wound when it becomes corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	But if the head of the rod becomes eroded and is completely destroyed within an hour, then you must insert into the penis a lead tube so that the patient can urinate over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the case of an adhesion of the foreskin with the head of the rod, and this kind of adhesion only occurs in someone whose foreskin is healthy and does not need circumcision; and when there is an adhesion due to a wound or swelling: you must therefore scrape it away using a blunt spatulum until the ligament is loosened and the head of the rod is freed on all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these with precision, then you must scrape away a little from the head of the rod and also from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the foreskin is thin it may be perforated quickly on account of its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and head of the rod with a fine linen cloth which has already been dampened in cold water so that they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated with styptic wine until it is healed.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On cleansing children and curing them from error occurring to them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like the rest of wounds; but since it is from our action, by our will, and its use is proper for boys, it is necessary that we mark this operation with an improvement and lead to health via an easier path.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because they do not use it in their laws and it is only something we acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	This is because I found that most craftsmen and bloodletters use cleansing by cutting with a knife or scissors; they apply alfechi (a type of medicine) and ligature with thread, and incision with an unguis (nail tool).
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	I myself have now tested all these methods, and I did not find a better cleansing method than using scissors and ligature with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a knife the skin often escapes (i.e., is not properly treated).
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the foreskin's skin has two layers; therefore, perhaps the upper layer is incised and the lower layer escapes (i.e., is not treated), necessitating another incision and causing pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with cleansing that is done with alfechi, i.e., a finger-like tool which shoemakers use, the incision of the tip of the male member is not secured because it may enter its opening (and cause damage).
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing with an unguis (nail tool), perhaps the iron slips and spoils your operation; moreover, a boy's skin is naturally short (i.e., small) and they are often born in such a way that they do not need circumcision - I have seen this myself.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	The process of excision with scissors and tying the wound with thread proved to be a good experience for me because the scissors are proportionate to the incisions; therefore, as their sharpness above is also sharp below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you place your hand on the above-mentioned premises, the two sharpnesses are proportionate and make incisions according to one operation at a given time; thus creating compression of similar form containing skin on every part of the rod with which there is no possible mistake.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	The way to perform this operation is that you make the boy, especially one with some intelligence, understand that you are doing nothing other than tying his thread around the rod and will let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him enjoy and rejoice in every possible way from the fact that he understands it.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands and not be seated; hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy does not see them nor any other instruments at all.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his rod and blow on the skin; pull it upwards until the head of the rod comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean that part from any dirt that has gathered on it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, tie below that another slightly looser one according to what is needed.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold between your thumb and index finger the lower place with a good grip; make an incision in between both threads.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upward quickly and extract the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run out gradually (for this is better), and put powder on it; then upon the powder a cloth spread with reduced veal broth in which has been stirred rose oil of good quality, bruised with fresh roses; leave him thereon until another day, and treat with remaining treatment until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the scissors used for cleansing (wounds) is as follows:...
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let there be two sharp points at the ends and let them intersect; lest an arm of the nail jut out on these; and let the length of both cutting edges be equal to the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	However an error occurring in cleansing is this: for perhaps the whole of the inner skin has escaped, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore you must stretch it back from your hour with your nail before the application of the styptic; and cut it equally.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you cannot hold it with your nail then extract it with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days have passed and that which is under the swollen rod remains an abscess; then let it be, until the abscess sits warm, and scrape it with ease, and cut it as prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Treat it therefore with that which consolidates wounds from the powders we described in the treatise on powders; and if it is cut out of the skin beyond measure and escapes upward, neither will this harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Take care of it with what we have said until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of retained urine from the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an occlusion caused by a stone, or by congealed blood, or by pus, or by flesh and things similar to those that we have described among the ways of treatment in this division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine does not loosen and you see that its retention is due to a stone which has already reached the neck of the bladder; then it's necessary for the patient to be positioned bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet should be arranged on his back and he should stretch out his belly from the upper part of his spine; and the patient should draw in his breath as far as is possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Thus the neck of the bladder is forced towards the back for the ejection of the stone; therefore, urine is evacuated.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	But if this does not resolve and the matter is severe for the patient; then it's necessary that you perform its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, of which this is the form Let it be made of silver, and let it be fine, soft, hollow like the quill of a feather in fineness equal to a ray, long about the length of one palm: let there be a fine nozzle at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the way of urine's exit through it is, take a doubled string and tie at its end wool or cotton, a good ligature: and insert the end of the string into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if anything superfluous remains from the wool, but insert [the filament] into the nozzle gently like a plug.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	First grease the syringe with oil or butter and the white of an egg; then make the patient sit on a seat, and swab the fistula, and anoint his member with moistened lint and olive-oil and tepid water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the member gently until it reaches the root of the member.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then tie it with two threads above, on the part of the belly.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside it until you reach the bladder and feel the patient has now reached emptiness; and this does not happen according to this order unless because the passage, where he enters, is one of twists and turns.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then draw out the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For what you seek will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it and make what you seek run through the urine passage; then repeat with the syringe and do not cease to do this until the fistula is emptied and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of bladder irrigation with a syringe.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder or blood is congealed in it, or pus is confined there and you wish to pour water and medicines into it; then use this instrument which is called a syringe, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is closed, that is to say deaf.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And it has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	The hollow place where the piston is located should be of a size to accommodate it without any additional space; as long as when drawn back, some fluid adheres to it and when pushed forward, that same fluid is expelled outward like a force pump discharging Greek fire (naphtha), i.e., during the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When you wish to discharge fluids into the bladder, immerse the end of the pump into the fluid and draw upwards on the piston; for the liquid will be drawn up into the hollow of the pump.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then immerse the end of it into the rod, as we have described for the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push the fluid with the piston; that very fluid reaches the bladder immediately so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Design an enema apparatus by which to give an enema to the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	It should be made of silver or latten; its head to be higher than the small alcam and beneath this a hollow into which falls the ligature.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Take the bladder of a ram and put into it whatever fluid you wish to administer as an enema to the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two hollows with a strong ligature of double thread, and warm that fluid somewhat over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then immerse the end of the enema apparatus into the rod; afterwards press your hand over the bladder containing the fluid with a gentle pressure until the patient feels that the liquid has reached his bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If the bladder is not available to you, then take a piece of parchment and make from it a circle; then perforate it throughout its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into those holes as they revolve.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then assemble the circle as you would a wheel: after placing on it what you want of moistures and oils and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument; and do with it as you did with the bladder from an expression by hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	§ On the extraction of stones.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken about the types of stones and their treatment with medicine; I have explained the difference between a stone formed in the kidneys, bladder, and its symptoms overall; I have described a stone that requires surgery using the hand or cutting; there is also a stone formed specifically in the bladder; and one fixed to a rod. I am narrating all this with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore that a stone formed in the bladder occurs most often in boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its symptoms are that the urine comes out of the bladder like water due to its thinness; and there appears white sand in it, and the patient rubs his penis, labours with it, and hangs down frequently.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then he rises up, and the anus comes out with him in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And healing is easy for boys until such time as they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	Among young men it is moderate; for those whose stone is larger, cure is easier; if it's smaller, the patient's condition worsens.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we reach the stage of treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with an enema, which will extract all the feces that are in their intestines; for this very thing sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Next, the patient should be taken by their feet and shaken, and moved downwards; so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or jump out from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands, prepared; and let his hands be under his hips, so that the bladder becomes completely sloped downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and feel him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you perceive the stone within an area, then hasten immediately with an incision over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must cleanse your index finger with oil of the left hand if the patient is a child; or the middle finger if they are an adult; and insert it into their anus, and feel for the stone until it lies steady beneath your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and push it to the outside towards the place of incision which you wish to make; and instruct an assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and direct another assistant to lift the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand, to remove the skin that is beneath the testicles on the side of the place where the incision will be made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the scalpel, cutting with one which is shaped like this:
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And make the incision on it which lies between the anus and the testicles, but not in the middle, towards the left buttock: and let the incision be made over the stone itself; and your finger should be inside the anus: and make a transverse cut, so that the exterior cut is wide, while the interior one is narrow, according to how large it can be for the exit of the stone from there not to be larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger compresses the stone which is at the anus during the operation, and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you should know that because of its corners and edges, a stone is something from which difficulty arises during its removal.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round: its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore for those with corners and edges, add it to the wound.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out like this, then you should use a lever on top of the stone; or squeeze above it with an implement whose end is curved like the moon, that squeezes the stone and does not slip from it; or insert beneath it a slender instrument with a curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot do so from above, then widen the hole slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If anything of blood overcomes you, cut it away with the knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if there is more than one stone, then push the larger towards the bladder's mouth first.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards push the smaller one after that; and do likewise if there are several, in twos.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If the large one is very big, it is ignorance to cut above it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For the patient either dies, or is troubled by constant dribbling of urine; this happens because the place does not heal at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But give him the instrument of discharge until it comes out; or insert levers into its fracture with forceps, until you extract it in pieces.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with incense, aloe, and dragon's blood; compress it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: to settle the hot abscess.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then turn the patient onto their front over their neck, and do not remove the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you remove it therefore, bathe the place with water and lots of oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with daphne ointment and royal ointment until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however, a hot abscess develops on the wound and it becomes ulcerous, and other similar things happen; such as if blood freezes in the bladder and prevents urine from coming out: this is known by the passage of blood with the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Insert therefore your finger into the wound and draw out that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply to it everything that is suitable for its cure until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary throughout the whole time of healing that you bind together the two thighs and attach them; for the sake of medicines which are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If however the stone is small and it is in the channel of the penis and becomes fixed there, and prevents urine from coming out; then treat it with what I have told you before you resort to cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times will you be excused from the operation by this cure; for I have already proved it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is necessary to take a perforator made from iron or steel, which has this form, with a triangular tip that is sharp and fixed into wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take some thread and tie it to the rod so that it doesn't return to the vesicle with a stone underneath.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Insert the piercing iron into the rod with ease until it reaches the stone; then turn the piercer with your hand on top of the stone gently and gradually, attempting to make that hole deeper until you break through from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For urine is immediately released.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then push your hand down on what's left of the stone from the outside part of the rod.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it will break apart and leave with the urine, and the patient will be healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this cure is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from happening, then tie a thread underneath the stone and another thread over the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the rod between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, untie the binding and clean the frozen blood that forms on the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary for the thread underneath the stone unless to prevent its return to the vesicle; and another binding over the stone unless so that when you untie the thread after the stone has left, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound. And that's why you need to raise the skin upwards when tying the upper thread so that it returns upon completion and covers the wound as we've said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	The removal of bladder stones in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Bladder stones occur less often in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If bladder stones occur in any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is prohibited due to the many complications.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is when the woman in question is perhaps still a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is that you do not find a woman who will expose herself to a doctor when she is chaste or among those having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is that you do not find a woman who has sufficient knowledge of this art, especially the surgical procedure with their hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is that it is far away from the stone's location, requiring deep incisions; this poses some concerns.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity requires you to proceed with it, then you should take a female physician who is well-versed; such people are rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you decide to proceed with the procedure, then seek out a chaste and skilled male physician; also find an experienced female midwife or a woman who has some skill in this art: make her present too and instruct her to carry out everything that you prescribe regarding examination of the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, it is necessary to examine whether the woman is a virgin; then you must insert your finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If you find it, grasp the stone beneath your finger and then instruct the midwife to insert their finger into the patient's vagina; they should examine for the stone after placing their left hand on her bladder and applying good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If he finds a stone, then it is necessary that he gradually move it from the urethral opening to the lower part with all his strength until he reaches the hip joint with it.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he cuts over it at the opposition of the midpoint of the pubic bone near the hip joint, from whichever side is prepared for him and where he feels the stone; his finger should not be removed from the stone, pressing underneath it; and let the first cut be small.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should insert his finger over that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he feels the stone, then he should enlarge the cut according to how much of it is coming out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And remember that stones come in many forms.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	Among these there is one that is small or large; smooth or rough; it may be long or round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore, you should recognise its type so that it may be signified to you by this over what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood overcomes you, then add some crushed ginger to the place for an hour until it stops bleeding.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your procedure until the stone comes out; and prepare what I have mentioned for extracting stones from men so that you can be helped by them with your procedure.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If you are overcome by bleeding and know that the blood is coming from an artery that has been cut; then put some powder on it and bind it with suitable bandages; do not change them; leave the stone alone and do not remove it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the sick woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wounds.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood is stilled after a few days, and the place becomes suppurated, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	§ On cutting for watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	Watery rupture is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the sac which is below the skin covering the egg-containing testicle; and it is called the scrotum.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own little sac which nature has prepared for it on the part of the egg; and this is another egg, and it is the skin of the testicle between the scrotum that we mentioned; and this happens only rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the cause of this type of rupture is indeed weakness that happens to the testicles; because this moisture-like material pours out towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens due to an impact on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture-like material has many colours.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or else its colour is inclined towards yellow, or it is bloody red, or dirty black, or watery white; and this last one is more frequent.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	The signs by which you may learn where the collection of water is, are these:
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the scrotal sac which we have mentioned, then the abscess forms a round swelling of even length like an egg-shape; and the testicle does not appear because moisture surrounds it on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in its own bandage, then it becomes a round abscess with an ear of barley, and because of this the man mistakes it for something else.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white part of the scrotum, then it falls under this category.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the colour of the moisture, then try the colour of the moisture in the abscess with a square introduced, whose shape preceded it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that which emerges in the track of the introduced object, judge about what is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to treatment with the iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to be bled if possible for him, and observe his body to be full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he shall lie on his back on something somewhat high, and place beneath him many cloths.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit to his left, and instruct the assistant to sit at his right, who shall stretch his rod to one of two sides of the skin of the scrotum, and towards the navel.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a spatula broad and flat, and cut the skin of the scrotum from its middle lengthwise, near to the comb; and let the incision be made according to an equally distant line which divides the skin of the scrotum until it reaches the white part embracing [the testicle]: and scrape it off and observe it, or take care against this, lest you cut into it: and let your scraping, by means of which you scrape, be from that part which is suspended with the egg more: and carefully examine with your scraping according to the quantity as far as possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the bladder full of water with a wide hole, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and stretch the bladder upwards, but do not touch the skin covering the testicles: and cut the bladder as best you can, either all at once or piecemeal, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there is no safety that water will not return due to its incision.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if an egg comes out of its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the bladder's incision, push it back inside.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it like other wounds until they heal.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find the egg corrupted by other blackness, then you must tie up the vessels which are its support, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its support, and extract the egg; afterwards treat it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if water is gathered into two parts, then know that there are two branches; therefore cut off the other part as you did the first equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to be one operation, then do this: afterwards wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rosewater; and put outside another piece of wool that you have steeped in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles and groins; and place doubled cloths on top, which are called 'poultices'; and tie them on with a bandage having six according to this pattern.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Two cloths should be taken and soaked; then they are filled with red lead powder, like so: the ends that are pressed are made of cotton or wet wool; these will be tied together around the patient's arms; one end reaches from above the anus to the back; the other side goes across the chest to the front; two more go over each thigh and finally another two go round both groins, and all ends should then be securely tied together around the patient's armpits.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	Sometimes this abscess may be artificially treated with the cautery instead of the knife; and you must take a fine lancet-shaped cautery and cut into the skin covering the testicles with it; and this should be hot, as we have described until you see white pus containing water coming out; then take the cautery in this shape.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	Is similar to Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce that white pus with it (the cautery), whilst hot, until all moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then pull the white pus out with hooks, and scrape it with a fine hot cautery; then cut into it as much as you can until you get all of it out.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And be careful not to let the fire touch the testicles.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you should know that this method is safer than the other one, it will stop bleeding for longer and it's better than cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If however any difficulty arises during the operation, whether from a hot abscess or bleeding or anything else at the time of cutting or cauterizing, you must treat that problem with whatever treatment is appropriate for it as we have already said.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is fearful and does not expect to survive this operation due to its horror: then perform the perforation as I have described it: and that is all.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you have confirmed through what we have said about the symptoms that the patient is watery in constitution: then you must make the patient sit on an elevated chair.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then perforate the abscess on its lower part with a broad spatula: and make the opening according to the length of the body, leaving it wide open until all water has drained out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a poultice on the site, bind it with a bandage, and let it stay in place until all remaining water has drained out; then treat the wound until it is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is resistance to the draining of water at the time when you perforate it: and this is not due to any other cause than that a white membrane creates an obstruction at the mouth of the wound and prevents the exit of water: then you must insert a feather into the wound, or the instrument used for drawing out dropsy fluid whose tip has been blunted: or introduce the latter into the operation on the wound in small amounts.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you should be aware that water returns and accumulates after six months or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it has therefore accumulated, then perforate again in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the treatment of fleshy rams' horns.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should be aware that, in the incision over this horn, fear leads to death in many cases.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me his dismissal is a salvation from that.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am reminded of the procedure on it, and the appearance of an abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, then, that many abscesses occur on bodies where the testes are located; and this happens for many reasons, to wit.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from an acute superfluity or sharpness which is poured out onto the testes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the colour of the abscess is according to that of the body's complexion, and there is no pain; and the abscess is serious.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a petrous abscess whose colour is dark and has no sensation.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the hardening of arteries and their swelling; as has already been mentioned before; or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	What is then from these from the swelling of arteries is recognized by the arrangement of the abscess when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And one ought not to touch it at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which happens from the swelling of veins does not discharge anything upon being pressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that an incision be made over this appearance, and over the remaining flesh; and you must excise the skin of the testes.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the scrotum upwards and extract it with a white cloth; and free the spermatic cord from the testis, and tie off the testis; and cut the spermatic cord after you have freed it from every part of the scrotum.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg is consolidated with those newly born flesh parts, then you must draw out the egg and cut it off.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adherence between something from the siphon or in that which is between the vessels, then you must free up all of that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then you must cut all of it and extract the egg as we said before.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Once your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool steeped in rose oil and wine; afterwards care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals up.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the treatment of fractures, which is done along with splints.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is an abscess that has developed a sort of wrapping around itself like a swelling with softening of the testicles; and it becomes difficult for the patient to move or exercise and walk about.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness there is fear on account of what preceded its recollection.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it behooves us to describe the treatment for this as was done by the ancients.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore that you must make the patient sit upon an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push up the supporter of the testicles to the lower parts.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers while holding onto the vessels that are closest to the rod; and let another assistant grip this and stretch it with a strong pull.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a sharp-edged spatula that is two digits wide across the straight path of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then remove the skin from all sides as we have told you when extracting arteries that are located on prominent areas of bone.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	After that, attach to them a needle in which is a thread twice as long and tie it on the first of those places where the veins are present; and tie it again at the last one.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in the middle of that straight incision according to the length of the body; and extract what is accumulated from dirty corrosive fluids.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the same treatment as other wounds where you want to generate pus so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles may fall out.
Non est enim malum per illud.	Indeed, it is not an evil thing.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if it should happen to all the veins, then both testes with their vessels must be removed on account of this; so that no egg may lose its nourishment due to the incision and shrivel or dry up without being any use to them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On treating branches of the intestine:
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The cause of these branches is from an incision that occurred through the sifach extending over the belly into the region of the groin on account of a tear in the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines from that rupture extend towards one of the testicles?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	This rupture is either on account of the sifach or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	These two types of injuries occur due to multiple causes such as blows, jumps, shouting or lifting heavy objects and the like.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign is that it comes from an extension of the scapula.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is a condition that happens gradually over time and not suddenly; it is an abscess with its deep aspect pointing inward because the scapula compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign is when it comes from the breaking of the scapula because at first it causes severe pain suddenly; and it is an abscess turned outward appearing just under the skin: this is due to the protrusion of the intestine and its course towards the outside of the scapula.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it exits with the intestine's tube; this is called a 'Ramex intestinalis' or hernia, and sometimes it happens with wind.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes faeces pass into the intestine and get stuck there; this is deadly for the patient because it causes severe pain especially when pressure is applied to the area.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And there is fear concerning the use of iron in treating these types of illnesses; thus, one must be careful to avoid complications when using it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	The method of surgery is to instruct the patient to push the intestine back into their abdominal cavity with their own hand if they are able and willing to do so.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then have them lie down with their neck between your hands; then lift up their legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch the skin that follows it upwards and cut through all of the scrotal skin lengthwise.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks into the two lips of the incision according to your need in opening up the wound with them; and let the incision be such that it is possible for an egg to exit through it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the spermatic cord and what is beneath the skin of the testicles until you uncover the white albuginea, which is hard on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white albuginea, which is under the scrotum's skin, and the second spermatic cord, and completely remove the adhesion that is in the scrotum's back part.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand towards the interior of the scrotal skin and, as you do this, pull upwards on the white albuginea with your left hand; raise the testicle along with the spermatic cord toward the area to be cut, and tell your assistant to lift the testicle upward while you free the adhesion behind it upon completing the dissection.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And check with your fingers that nothing of the intestine is wrapped around there at the white hard albuginea.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find anything of it there, then push that part towards the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with thick thread made of ten linen threads and insert it into the last spermatic cord, that is, the tunica vaginalis that follows the scrotum's incision; then cut off the protruding ends of the thread until you are left with four strands.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Next, form some of these into a cross-shaped figure and bind them with the aforementioned 'alsifach' (a tough band) that lies beneath the testicle's skin; do this tightly around the spermatic cord so as to prevent any blood vessels from sending nourishment to it, lest an abscess forms.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another band on top of the first one, two fingers' breadth away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	After these two ligaments let there be left of the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, the amount of one finger's length; and cut off all that remains according to its roundness, and remove from it the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut through the lower part of the skin of the testicles with a slice from which blood and pus flow out; as we described above.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Next apply wool steeped in oil to the wound; and use the ligament as we described above.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	Sometimes the white sifach that we have mentioned is cauterized after its incision for fear of profuse bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligature in place until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its falling off is delayed, then bathe it with warm water; and place over it the substance that we mentioned until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the usual treatment of wounds until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Chapter on the Ramice Leech.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this chapter on the treatment of the Ramice Leech, I have not seen anyone who has dared to attempt its treatment with iron [instruments].
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And those who were the first to comment on it said that its treatment is carried out as we described above for the ramice leech with the vine [leech].
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, bind the cords around it after its incision with ease at the bottom; then cut in the middle and treat finally with what opens it until the cords fall off; and treat the wound as we said until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	The disruption which occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the site protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is only for a short while, and then returns at all hours: but if this state persists for some time, there is added a hernia of the spermatic cord until eventually the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this occurs due to an extension of the spermatic cord which is in the groins, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is to say, because the spermatic cord becomes extended; then it softens, the site hardens, and it protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with the caustic, as has been mentioned in the previous chapter.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with the iron in this manner: that is, to have the patient lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the site of the rupture, which is hardened and protruding, with an incision across its width to a depth of three fingers' breadth.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then grasp the spermatic cords and that which is beneath the skin until such time as you have identified the white spermatic cord which follows it under the skin.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Take an iron rod and place it over the protruding site of the spermatic cord, pressing it deep into the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Sew the two protruding sites on the end of the iron rod from the spermatic cord together with a suture; then remove the end of the iron rod.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut into the alsifach at all, nor stretch the ovum, or anything else, as I have made you aware of during the treatment for an intestinal branch.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat that wound with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	Therefore, when you cut the filaments, clean it, and restore the wound until it hardens.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For sisach contracts and does not add to the prominence of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place, for it is closer to healing.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Concerning softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles softens many times in certain men due to which the flesh that is between them also softens, and its appearance becomes unsightly.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary for him who is asked to treat it that he make the patient lie on his back and cut all of the skin which has softened onto the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then gather the two lips with a suture; and if you wish, sew the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat with the treatment of remaining wounds until it is healed, and the filaments fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	On castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that castration is forbidden by our laws; therefore, I could have omitted it from this book of mine, and there would be no need to mention it except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	The first reason is so that it may be within the knowledge of the physician when he is asked about it; and also so that he may know how to treat a person who has undergone such a procedure.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	The second reason is that we often require the castration of certain animals for our own benefit, such as rams, goats, cats, and similar creatures.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I will therefore say that castration is performed in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Either by scraping.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In the procedure that is done by scraping, the method of operation is as follows: you should make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften, relax, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer perceptible to touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In the procedure that is done by incision and cutting, you must hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament and cut above each testicle with one incision until you see two testicles; then cut these after scraping both of them, but do not let anything from the scrotum remain except for a thin layer which is over the cord.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than the one done by scraping because scraping may leave some of the testicle behind, which will make the animal desire sex.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On the treatment of hermaphroditism, there are two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is made from men in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears in him what follows space, or on the skin of the testicles, what is between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine runs out of what is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	However, in women there is one type, and it is a woman's vulva over the pubic bone like small male testes entirely, protruding to the outside; of which one is like a man's penis, and two are like two testes.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of these three types, two from men, and one type from women, is as follows: because you must cut away the added flesh until the impression of it escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	However, in the second type of men from which urine runs out of what is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is it treatable at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the cutting of warts, and protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	A wart perhaps is added on top of the natural thing until it becomes ugly and its appearance is unsightly; and sometimes it magnifies in some women so much that it expands like men's, and reaches to intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	You should therefore hold the excess of the tumor with your hand or with a hook and cut it off; and do not stop cutting, especially at the deep root; so that there is no flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the treatment for wounds until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, flesh arising is the flesh that grows from the opening of the womb until it fills itself; and perhaps it exits to the outside resembling a tail; and for this reason some ancient physicians call the illness 'tailed'.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	We should therefore cut it like we cut the tumor, and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of alratica, which is an unpenetrated wound of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is when there is an unpenetrated wound of a woman or a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental alratica arises from an earlier illness; and it occurs either due to added flesh born of the flesh or a thin membrane or thick membrane; and it can be in the depths of the womb or its sides or at its top or bottom; and it prevents intercourse, impregnation, childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	Its diagnosis is made by the midwife's inspection, if the obstruction appears nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If it is not apparent, then search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the obstruction is from a thin membrane and it's near the two lips, then hasten to tear it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is necessary to place some gauze on the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put the index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with force until they tear open delicately, revealing the orifice.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the wound; have her come every day so that the wound does not heal with any other matter.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If the orifice is thick and dense, then it must be cut out with a spatula that is wide like a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If the growth is fleshy in nature, then suspend it with hooks and cut it out; have ready some medicines which will stop any flow of blood without cauterization such as gum acacia and dragon's blood mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then insert a lead tube of adequate size so that the wound does not heal too quickly; keep it in place for some days and apply a linen plug afterwards, then treat any remainder with healing remedies until it is fully healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when there is a birth of other flesh-like growths inside the womb, they must be cut out like this; for while an abscess or cancerous lump inside the womb are not treated with iron at all, it would be counterproductive to do so.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of haemorrhoids, itchy bumps, red moles on women's bodies.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Haemorrhoids are indeed an opening of the veins which causes much blood to flow out from them regularly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids are burned, they become hardened; and I have already spoken about their types and signs in the division of them, and here I will speak about which ones receive a cure and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I therefore say that hemorrhoids which are inside the uterus opening and do not show externally have no cure with a knife.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those hemorrhoids which are inside the uterus opening but also felt externally - these are the ones that can be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary to put the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then stretch out the hemorrhoids with tweezers or a rough cloth, and cut them off from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then sprinkle on them at the time of blood flow from one powder of these cut ones without any mixing - acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterward, put her into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the blood flow persists then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rinds and galls and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar to make a plaster from it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If the blood stops with this then it is good; if not, apply cupping glasses to her back and breasts without making any cuts.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and dip it into the juice of thapsia or eelgrass juice or the juice of alant roots (that is, greater meadow-rue), Pontic wine and bind it on with linen.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the abscess is quiet, then treat the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Bartholomew is red like the heads of garlic, and he is of a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary then that you cut away what appears from it, as I said earlier equally on both sides; and treat it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	On the perforation of the womb which happens in childbirth.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	There are many kinds of abscesses which occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcer, and scabby sores, and lekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulae, and haemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and telar, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already spoken of all these diseases and their kinds, and their signs, and their treatments in different chapters; it is necessary that I speak in this treatise about the hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is one of those abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening with an iron is performed.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you pay attention.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its onset is sharp with a throbbing sensation, and heat, and fever; and you see it turn red; if feeling fails over it, then do not hurry with its perforation; and treat it with that which assists towards maturation, until such time as the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then you should make the woman sit on a seat which is wet with two cushions, and recline, or be propped up over her back, and gather her feet towards the lower part of her belly; and let her hips be expanded, and place her arms under her knees, and bind each one with a suitable bandage to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side and use the tool to open the womb's opening.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes after them.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And when you wish to use this tool, you must insert the rod deep into the woman's womb so that what enters from the tool does not exceed the depth of the womb and harm the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the tool is longer than the depth, then you must place markers on the shaft to indicate the womb's depth so that the tool does not penetrate further and harm the patient. The assistant should turn the handle which runs along the tool from above, holding it steady, and turning until the womb opens.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When the head appears and is felt by hand, being soft and gentle, you must cut it at its top with a spatula an inch wide.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When pus is drained, you must place on the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil with some styptic quality and apply it deep inside the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place outside over the womb and over the pubic hair clean wool soaked in water boiled with apples.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then you must treat it for two days with an ointment suitable to the wound until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And the womb and wound are sometimes washed so that they are irrigated with water and honey; then with water boiled with lily root or long aristolochya; after this return to ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	But if the wound is hidden inside the womb, you must refrain from treating it with an iron tool, instead treat it as said above.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The teachings on midwifery, how living embryos are treated when born with an unnatural shape.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for midwives to first understand the shape of a normal birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From these signs it can be recognised that when you see a woman pushing downwards and wishing to take in air, and what is above her relaxes during the birth, and there is urgency about the exit of the embryo: then you should know that this birth is taking place according to its natural shape, and its exit will be over its head, and the afterbirth with it either suspended or hanging from the umbilicus.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, it is necessary that her abdomen be pushed, so the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has descended on its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and is cleansed of those superfluities by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	All other forms of birth besides this one are unnatural and unworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Sometimes a fetus exits on its feet, with its body coming out before its head and its feet or hands first, sometimes one foot; sometimes the baby's head comes out with its hands; sometimes it is the breech which emerges: perhaps the neck turns; all these unnatural shapes are unworthy.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary that the midwife be prudent and subtle with regard to all these matters, take care not to err or be deceived; for I am showing each shape and form, how they are composed of parts, and indicating what they mean, so they can stand on their own.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus exits headfirst in its natural delivery and it becomes intense for the woman and difficult for her to give birth, and you see her strength already debilitated: then have her sit on a chair, or women hold her; and vapor from a woolen cloth with fenugreek decoction, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert between her fingers a small spatula and tear with it the perineum, cutting it with her nail until what is inside it runs out of moisture; then press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then the woman must be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then instruct her to be pressed after the enema; make her sneeze with a powder puff and hold her mouth and nose at once.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will exit immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two of the fetus's hands exit first, it is necessary that you pull them back with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not obey upon entry, then place the woman on a chair and lift her feet upwards; then shake the chair on the ground; and the woman should be held so as not to fall with the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not exit and the fetus dies; then cut them and extract its remainder; tie its hand with a cloth and pull it out evenly; for he will exit.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo feet-first.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus exits feet-first, then it is necessary to push its feet upwards; afterwards turn it gradually and then level it out.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	He should then take one of his feet and stretch it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they [the splinters] therefore come out as far as the thighs, then tell him to press it and make him sneeze with pepper: it will come out if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have described, then draw the splinters gradually until you put them in their natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will come out easily itself at that time.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if it is not possible with all that we have described: then take from the mucilage of the Althaea plant, and oil of sesame, and dissolved gum: and pound everything in a mortar with good force: then anoint with it a woman's woolen cloth, and apply to his lower abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make him sit in warm water until he sweats profusely from the armpits.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that his lower parts have become warm, then give him a drink of myrrh: and place it [the poultice] on top.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore he has held the drink for one hour, then make him sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make him sneeze: and squeeze his mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the abdomen with gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the splinters will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The outcome of the splinters is on his knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this form, then insert your hands gradually into his body.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie down on her neck, and let her feet hang towards the lower parts; she herself is to be lying on a bed with her hands folded.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gradually upon her abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows until she is ready in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not exit, then take her feet and move them with a strong motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press gradually upon what is above the hypocondrium until the fetus rises to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then he should insert his hands and guide the fetus gradually; tell the woman to push until the fetus exits.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	It is necessary to manipulate her hand for its reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however he cannot reduce it then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed; shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the ointment you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she catches hold of it with her labour then make her sit on the seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then try to manipulate her hand for its reduction and guide the fetus according to its natural shape; make the woman sneeze and tell her to push until it exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus emerges onto its neck, with hands spread apart, and its face is turned towards the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the baby's hand, then gradually turn it over, and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When the baby is equalized, then place on its head what we have described, made of oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then ask it to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit on a chair and ask her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then tell her to bear down, and make her sneeze with force.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared baby emerges onto its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When the baby descends into the womb in this way with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is evacuated of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If the afterbirth hangs over the baby's face and neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the baby into the womb until you place it as required; and tell the woman to bear down several times, for itself will come out of a gentle birth.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The emergence of twins or many babies.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should be aware that twins often occur; and sometimes three or four babies are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is unusual and rare.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	There are five things that exist outside of nature and do not fully live: although they multiply, one amniotic sac contains them; they are separated by the sifach which distinguishes between each of their umbilical cords.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they are born as a single fetus with an easy natural birth, or they are born with an unremarkable exit, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult during birth and reach that which we have mentioned regarding unnatural positions, then treat them as we have described; and let there be a skilled midwife, who acts with skill and slowness, and the child will be born according to every position with whatever help is given for their safe delivery.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and miscarried.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and even more up to ten; and I have verified that a woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all fully formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	This was determined by the measurement of the wise and glorious one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Thus, all of this ought to be within the knowledge of the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps they will come to resemble it; therefore, let them oppose this with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus as described in the section on medicinal treatment and it does not come out, and you are forced to use manual manipulation, then you must be mindful.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If the woman is of sound virtue and has not been afflicted by any conditions that may cause her harm, then she should lie on her back on the bed with her head inclined downward and legs raised; two assistants must hold her in place or strap her to the bed so that during delivery her body does not slip out.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils mixed with marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mixtures, then easily insert it into the womb.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should ask the woman for the place where to hook the hooks from the fetus and convenient places to do so.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then if the fetus is ready to be delivered head first: hook the hooks into its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or beneath the chin, or in the fork of its neck, or near the ribs and under the hips.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however its descent is by foot first then hook into the pubic bone and middle of its back.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand and place its curve between the fingers of her left hand; then insert this easily and hook into one of the places mentioned until reaching an empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then hook another or even third opposite to the first one if required so that it contracts evenly and does not tilt to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it must be pulled with an equal pull and not a straight one but rather one that moves to all sides so as to ease its delivery just like in the case of tooth extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary for that which lies between them to soften and lengthen.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part is retained from it, then the midwife must grease certain fingers with oil and insert them on that side so as to turn with them what was retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	So if part of the fetus comes out, then change the hooks to another place that is higher: do this until the entire fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If one hand comes out before the other and it is not possible to draw it back due to its contraction, then a cloth must be rolled up over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then draw it out until it comes out completely; cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow; and so you must do with the other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the fetus's head is large or it becomes contracted during exit, or there is a build-up of water in its head, then one must insert between the fingers a thorny spatulum and pierce the head with it to draw out the water; or break open its skull using an instrument called an almizdaac, whose shape appears along with those of other instruments in the chapter that comes after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise, if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then one must cut with an algengemat; or draw it out with an almizdaac, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then draw the bones out with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head comes out and becomes contracted at the fork, then it must be pierced until all the moisture is drained from its chest.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it does not form a knot and does not obey attempts to extract it, then cut off the head of the worm with as much tissue as possible.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If there is an abscess or dropsy of the lower belly, you should pierce it until moisture flows out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If however the fetus is lying on its feet, then traction will be easy and you can direct it to the mouth of the womb with ease.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is trapped at the belly or chest, you should remove it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; tear open the belly or chest until their contents flow out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If however the rest of its body is delivered but not its head, then a midwife should insert her left hand... [and complete the sentence]
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the mouth of the womb is open, then you should put your hand inside to search for its head with your fingers and draw it out until you can see it at the mouth of the womb; after this insert a hook or two hooks and use them to pull it out.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mouth of the womb is blocked due to a hot abscess, you should not work on it; instead give an evacuation of moist and fatty substances, apply poultices and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is lying on its side, it may be turned; you should do as we have said for a living child.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If this cannot be done, then cut it in pieces and remove it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	You must not leave any part of the placenta inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	Once you have completed your procedure, then apply what we said for hot abscesses that occur in the uterus.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there is bleeding, then get into astringent waters, and undergo the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	Indeed, I have seen a woman whose belly contained a dead fetus; then she became pregnant again with another child, but that one also died afterwards.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	So after some time she developed an abscess at her navel, which swelled until it burst open and started discharging pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called to treat her, and I administered long-term medication; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	So I applied on it some of the strongest drawing plasters, and a bone came out from its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then after several days another bone emerged.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was amazed by this because there is no bone inside the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	So I thought that these were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I examined the wound and extracted many bones while the woman was in better condition; she has now lived like this for a long time and discharges hardly any pus from that place anymore.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I do not assert this as something strange, except that there is knowledge and help in it for the skilled physician who treats with his own hand.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the shapes of instruments required for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the forceps, which has two handles that are equal in length and each have a pivot at both ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this pivot should be thinner than the forceps and it can be made either from ebony or boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	The width of each piece of wood should be approximately two fingers wide and the edge of both is about one finger thick; the length of each should be a palm and a half long. At the centre of these two pieces of wood are attached two extensions made from the same type of wood, which have already been fixed into place on either side. These extensions are each a palm and a little more in length with a width that is around two fingers or slightly wider.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	These two extensions are inserted into the womb's opening so that it opens with them when you turn both pivots.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The shape of the pivot which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another similar shape, but thinner and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It should be made from ebony or boxwood following the pattern of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However at the end of it there are two extensions as you can see above and each extension's length is a palm; its width is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	So when you wish to open the womb with this device then make the woman sit on a bed with her feet hanging down and her legs parted.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two joined additions into the womb: and you holding the end of the lower instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, evenly according to the amount of opening of the womb that you wish, until the Midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The other form of vertigo that the ancients called the Form of the Pushing Force by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The Form of Almisdac, by which the large head is crushed: and it resembles forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made oblong, like forceps in this form, as you see, which have teeth like a saw's, by which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The Form of Almisdac by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The Form of Vuncini having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The Form of Vuncini having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps with saw-like teeth, by which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The Form of Spatumilis having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The Form of the two broad Spatumilia.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used, and the more their types multiply, and the more they are prepared by the artisan, the quicker he is at his operation, and the higher in esteem with people because of their number.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise any of these instruments lest it be unprepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	Their need for it is indeed inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Regarding the extraction of the Secondina nerve.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Secondina nerve is retained during childbirth, you should instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with powder; hold your hand over her mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it therefore comes out by this method, that is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not, take a pot and make a hole in the lid; put into it herbs that open the womb, such as galbanum, rue, dill, chamomile, sea-wormwood, wood aloe, and centaury: Take all these herbs or some of them and soak them with water, then place them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed pip over the hole of the pot lid and another end into the womb; let her hold it until the steam reaches the depth of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze as we have described.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The Secondina nerve will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in oil of turpentine or marshmallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should insert it into the vulva and search for the Secondina nerve with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	Once she has found it, she should grasp it and gradually draw it out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If it is attached deep within the womb, then insert your hand as we have described until you find the second membrane and extract it gradually following its direction so that the womb does not fall due to a strong pull; rather, it should be moved with ease to the right and left sides; then apply the amount of traction required.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It then obeys (your instructions), is preserved, and comes out from any adhesions.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the os of the womb is contracted, as we have already described, treat it with sneezing and with an ointment made from herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself by repeating the extraction process.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But whatever comes out at the os of the womb from it, you should tie to the woman's thigh.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then enema her with the four-fold ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will indeed cause her to rot after days, and be dissolved, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it rots, a bad smell is raised from it to the stomach and head, and harms the patient.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of watercress and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	Make an instrument with which to fumigate the woman in cases of retained secundine and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Make it from a glass similar to an alcama or from zere: and place the wide end over the fire: and place the fumigation on top of coals: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and do another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which has already been blocked by a very fine membrane.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary therefore for the midwife to pierce this membrane with her finger; and if she cannot, let her pierce it with a sharp probe, being careful not to wound the muscles underneath.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it wool dipped in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Treat it afterwards with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear that it will become blocked again, then place a leaden tube in the orifice for many days and remove it when the child is able to void urine.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And sometimes obstruction of the anus occurs due to healing of wounds or abscesses.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore to cut that healing, then treat it with what we have said about treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the treatment of fistulas which occur on the lower part (of the body).
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The fistulas which occur on the lower part are nodules and lumps that appear outside the anus or on one side of it; there may be a single fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that nodule becomes old, it opens up and runs out of it a white watery fluid or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there are penetrating fistulas which come from these (nodules).
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Thus any discharge that comes from a wound is known by its penetration, and also by the presence of wind, when the patient uses an emetic; and perhaps worms will come out with it.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas among them when they are in the space penetrating up to the bladder and up to the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And some penetrate as far as the hip joint and as far as the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	But from that by which a penetrating fistula as far as the anus is known, there is also one which does not penetrate; you should insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe of brass or iron into the fistula when it has no twists.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a twist in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe or a hair from a horse's tail until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	But if you do not feel it at the bottom and nothing comes out of the orifice by way of discharge, nor is there any wind, nor worms as I said, then you know that it does not penetrate; so proceed to its cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula is penetrating up to the bladder or up to the urethra, its indication is the discharge of urine from it and the prevention of that place being consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If, however, it is penetrating up to the hip joint or up to the bone of the hip, then its sign is that the probe reaches as far as there if there is no twist in it down to the bone; and the finding of pain around the part, and that pus always comes out of it: and that medication does not take effect in it nor is it consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	There is no cure whatsoever for all penetrating fistulas; and their treatment is a waste of effort for the foolish doctor on whom it is performed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In cases where the fistula is not penetrating and not old, healing can be expected with the knife; as I tell you, and I have proven it myself: and it requires that the patient lie on their back between your hands; and raise their legs above their hips, and let their hips be inclined towards their abdomen.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert a lead or brass probe into it until you know where the probe has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	However, if the patient feels it near their anus, then you must insert your index finger into their anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel that the probe has already penetrated what you have detected with your finger, beyond which you feel neither sinew nor flesh, then know for certain that it is penetrating; do not labour over it because there is no cure for it as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	Some say that flesh can be healed and from the medication by which benefit is expected, it requires a fine cauterium fire to be made according to the width of the fistula as mentioned before, and insert it burning into the fistula until it reaches near the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this twice or three times until you know that all the added flesh near the fistula has been cauterised which is like a bird's cane.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with linen bandages smeared in butter until the cauterised flesh comes out; then dress it with ointments that produce and strengthen flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it heals, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the abscess breaks out and does not reach your finger which is inside the anus, but there remains between it and the abscess a thick layer of flesh, or cauterize: and you see that there is a fistula in what follows along the surface of the skin, then cut away the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and as you go on cutting with the knife inside the fistula until you reach where the end of the abscess comes out, and the abscess will be released and fall off.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those flesh fragments which resemble the tubes of a feather so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if blood overpowers you and prevents you from performing the cut due to your own actions or those of another person, then it is better for you and more helpful in achieving a quicker recovery that you cauterize it with fire, or an acrid medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the fire-cauterization joins good properties: the charring of those additional flesh fragments and the cutting off of blood supply, as well as drying up moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with bandages wrapped in butter, or chopped-up cabbage leaves until the place emits pus and those charred flesh fragments come out into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with healing ointments that form hard flesh; and these are medicines which have styptic as well as drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For once they are restored, then it is already healed; and you need not fear repetition [of the treatment].
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already reached down deep into the anus and stretches out from there due to its excessive length: then put your finger inside the anus, and feel around with it for [the fistula].
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If you therefore feel a tumor and it is between you and the incision, and it consists of skin or flesh, and it is close to being penetrated; then there is no operation on it except by way of confidence and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	This is because one of three methods is administered on it: either you cauterize it, as we said; or you cut it away until you reach its concavity so that it is possible for you to introduce licinia and nearby treatment.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too far with the cutting so as not to cut into the sphincter containing the anus, and it happens on the weak excretion outlet without volition.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will indeed heal; or you will remove the tumor and clean it after cutting it close to the anus as we said, either with a probe or another sharp-pointed instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse the filtered flesh which is in the incision as far as you are able with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of the whole wound with its incision and upper orifice where it has healed; and a fistula remains open on the interior part of the anus, and will be lighter for the weak person.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes a fistula follows in this way: that is, when you introduce a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus; then take a pointed probe which is like a needle for removing splinters, that is, preparing coria, in this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a thread wound from five threads, and about that amount.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with a thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it penetrates inside the margin of the anus near to it, then pull out the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the anus and extract the end of the thread, and unite both ends together: and tie up each one, and leave it for one or two days. The more the thread cuts into the flesh, bind it well until those parts which are between the two ends of the thread drop off; then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate by any means that presents itself to you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it does not behove you to make it for the sake of the arm in order that you may avoid cutting into it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Make a spatula with spines from what the fistula is split in two; its curve being very acute and one part not acute so that it does not cut into that which is unnecessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the stitching of hemorrhoids from which blood is discharged when they are cut open: and treatment for fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Head 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	Hemorrhoids come in two types.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they exist inside the anus either like bladders of coals or plums; or as if they were grains themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And among them some are small and others large; and blood is discharged from them always either singly or many at a time.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are mostly of little moisture, from which runs yellow water or a steady flow of blood; and they are according to the colour of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure for that which is inside the anus is to advise the patient to empty their bowels; and it should be expressed until it exits the anus, and you see the hemorrhoids appear.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, also lift them with hooks; or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they are not retained by the hooks, because of their moisture and softening; then take them with a rough cloth, or with a cord made from double-twisted wool, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and sprinkle over them after the cutting some hot powders, so that they stay in place like a caustic.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	But if the anus does not obey by exiting, then give the patient an enema with a small bite, so that it washes what is inside the anus, and obeys quickly to exit when the patient empties themselves.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	However, if the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their condition is light and easy; and it is such that you should take them with your nail, or take them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Treat them with what we have discussed until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And for those who fear the incision of iron, you must administer their suture in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the rolled thread, and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw the needle to the upper part and make it penetrate with the needle into the root from its other side; and wrap the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle so they are perpendicular to each other, and tighten the needle strongly with a stitch.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie off the thread and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the sutures, leaving one out of each; do not draw them tight so that excess blood may flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over the wound a cloth soaked in rose oil or caustic oil, and put it over the wound; and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the sutures fall off, treat them with ointments and the rest of the cure until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	They often happen from drying out of faeces and natural constriction.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they are dried out and medicine does not help them; then you must scrape with the point of a spatula or your nail until they become moist, and remove from them the upper layer which prevents them from healing.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them until they heal as is appropriate.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not become firm, repeat the procedure with more force than before until they bleed profusely and then treat them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of Almirmar for inverted and non-inverted conditions, and on Athelil for dry and moist wounds.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that Almirmar is nothing other than a round knot of the same colour as the body, similar to the head of a nail; it occurs all over the body but particularly on the lower parts of the feet and toes, and causes pain when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is therefore necessary to cut what is around the nail-head and hold it with forceps or a hook, then pull it out by its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it, and if you wish to cauterise it as explained previously in its own chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	One type of Athelil in dry wounds is a small, rough, hardened, rounded bump on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And it often occurs on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	To treat it, you should stretch out the Athelil and cut into it; or bind it with silk thread, or with a hair until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterise it with fire or with a caustic medicine as mentioned previously; and then remove the inverted and non-inverted Athelil with the instrument I will describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A Formica is also a small hardened bump on the surface of the body that goes very deep; and when it encounters cold, there is a sensation like an ant bite in it, and they appear all over the body but especially on the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a small tube made from a goose quill, or the strong feather of a vulture; and place that tube over an ant until it fills the circle of the tube with its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the tube until you cut what is around the ant; and place it deep into the flesh, thus uprooting the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do this with an air tube or iron tube, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the tube be sharpened to a point, which will draw out the deaf person's earwax; easing its grip on their finger and its own turning.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant as has been mentioned previously regarding cauterization of a boil; see Chapter on Cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	On the shapes of instruments which are administered for enemas in illnesses of the anus, and for relieving the belly, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or brass, or cast bronze, or sheet copper.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made of these instruments small or large, depending on those to whom they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	That which is administered for the treatment of small children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, their enemas likewise.
Clistere magnum.	Enema, large.
Cistere paruum.	Enema, small.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube - that is the upper end to which is tied a bladder - should be wide according to this pattern; and it should have a mark showing how to tie the bladder as you see here; its lower end which is inserted into the anus should be tapered, that is not open but smooth, very soft; on one side of it are two holes, and on the other side there is just one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	The size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the spokes, slightly larger and into it place the medicines from an animal's bladder or from a sheep's paper which is shaped like a small asofti whose base is one palm in diameter.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it is pierced with many holes as it revolves, and there should be the space between each hole equal to the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into those holes a strong raw thread, which is made of ten threads or thereabouts, and attach to it the bag like an asofti's.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore the bag is placed on it, bind it at the head of the enema tube between the two distinguishing marks with a strong tightening.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then administer an enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the circular form of the bag depicted here, along with its holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of administering the enema with it is that you fill the bag or bladder with medicine which has been heated according to the tolerance of the patient's condition; and be careful not to use very hot nor very cold [medicine].
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then let the patient lie on his back and raise his legs upwards; and place under him an inthan, that is, a leather hide upon which people sit, or a cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the end of the enema tube with oil or sheep's tallow, or with linseed mucilage or honey.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus gently.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the attendant should take up the bag with both hands together and squeeze it forcefully until all that is in the enema tube has been evacuated into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then extract the enema and raise the patient's legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If medicine makes him feel deathly ill then he should hold on as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if they sleep through the whole night with it then it is even more helpful.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you enema them due to abdominal pain, and their death is hastened as a result, then repeat the enema until they are cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are haemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus then a very gentle and mild enema should be given, using those types of enemas with which children are given enemas.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And let this be the form of a gentle enema for when there is tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On curing head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken about the division of wound treatment in a previous chapter and I will now explain here their treatment by hand and with medicine according to the completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I therefore say that wounds are divided according to the means by which they are inflicted and also according to the place on which the wound is received.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The means by which wounds are inflicted are therefore many and various as for instance a blow from a stone or the stroke of a sword or knife or a thrust with a lance or wooden staff or arrow; there are numerous similar cases.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	The places on the body where wounds are received also differ; for instance a wound to the head or neck chest abdomen flank and similar parts of other limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am describing the cures for certain wounds, so that I may set out this reasoning and rule for other wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I shall start with simple head wounds, since the description of compound fractures will come at the beginning of Chapter Three.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When there is a simple wound to the head and no bone fracture occurs: consider then if it was caused by a blow from a stone or similar object, and has already broken the skin only; and it is a large wound, and you fear an adverse outcome of warm abscesses: then proceed quickly, and perform an immediate cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay it: and draw off some blood according to the extent of his strength: if there is nothing preventing him from undergoing phlebotomy, especially if the blood flowing out of the wound is small in amount.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be performed on the opposite side from the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient beware of over-eating, wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If anything prevents him from having reduced amounts of food, then let his diet be further diminished, and let him avoid meats or wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And if an abscess occurs on the wound, place upon it a poultice soaked in rose oil alone or with wine that has some astringency to it.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are confident there will be no warm abscess, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and the air has not yet changed it, some powder which I shall describe shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then apply certain ointments until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large, or it is caused by an incision of a sword and similar weapons: and its lips do not join together with the help of poultices, then you must bring them together with stitches, as I will explain in relation to abdominal wounds regarding their suturing.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If a wound has been detected near the bone and it is hanging loose with no retention except for a small bandage: then cut it open.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	After that treat the wound with medicines and restore hard flesh in place of skin there; and tell the patient to eat foods which have some weight/substance such as heads (of animals), cooked wheat until it is soft like porridge and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin and it is not attached to bone: then cut away all that is putrefied and throw it out; afterwards treat it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If there is an artery or a vein from which blood continues to flow in these wounds and it is not stopped by medicines; then make an incision above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If you find that it is not cut then cut it with a sharp knife or ligate (tie off) it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the need arises such that what I have said is not applicable then cauterize it until the blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If these wounds are small and simple then their treatment is easy; so that you sprinkle this powder on them: since it hardens them before the air changes/alters them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Recipe of Flesh Powder (pulveris incarnati)
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part frankincense (olibanum), two parts dragon's blood and three parts unslaked lime; grind all of this very well and sift it: fill the wound with it and bind it tightly so that it adheres to it well and coagulates together with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then compress it from above with swabs and leave it be, without removing until such time as it shall not fall off.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	See that the medication is not removed from him before he is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes lime alone will do this, when you have no frankincense on hand, and even dragon's blood performs the same operation in many large wounds, where it is appropriate to place them on top of these and compress them; they are fresh wounds with their own blood that has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if it has already been altered by air in some way, especially when this is at a time of year that is summery, then the intention of this powder is not in place: rather take care of it with what we have said, so as to put some digesting ointments on top; or lay poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the remainder with healing until it is healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If however a fracture occurs with the wound in bone and is small, then extract it with gesti: and I shall now speak of the healing of fractures to the head at some point in the future.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	On wounds of the neck:
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If however a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference between it and the treatment of a simple head wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If however the neck nerve has been cut through or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there lies no skill in its healing apart from to be deprived of that which causes violent constriction, such as Zinnia and Zea mays, and their like.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Since they harm nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold whatsoever on the wound: for the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is superior to other body parts; let it be that by which it is healed from among medicines, gentle, such as lime washed with sweet water several times infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tutia, when it is also washed with sweet water: and the remaining mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then apply a suture; or contract its lips with threads.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if there is depth to the wound, or if a cavity has formed within its lower part, where pus has already gathered, then pierce it at a more depressed place on it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If an artery has been cut within the wound and its flow of blood has been lost; then separate it or tie it off, and bind it; or cauterize it if necessity provokes you to do so.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if now the windpipe has been split or entirely severed and the larynx saved; then bring together the lips of the skin with a suture over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe itself, but rather set it equal to its former state, and return it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with an appropriate bandage and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments that have an astringent quality or those which dry out the wound, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression in the bone, then probe it; if there are fragments of bone inside, extract all of them or as many as you can; and what cannot be removed, leave it until the wound becomes gangrenous, separates, and its discharge is alleviated.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle over it the powder I described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If however you see bone in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with what was mentioned in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On wounds in spatulates.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a blow from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If breath escapes from the wound when the patient gasps, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is fresh with its blood, then do not apply any powder to it at first, nor bind it tight so that the blood is not retained in its depth and return to the heart and kill the patient; but put on it an attracting ointment, and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If however the ointment is not available to you, then put on the wound's orifice an old cloth so that it sucks out what comes from it of humours; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what gathers in it runs off.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If however three days or more have passed since the wound and no spasm, nor evil trembling of the heart, nor tightness in gasping has occurred to the patient, and you see his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is saved.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Take care of it yourself with lint dressings and other treatment until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	But if its healing is neglected, and it keeps opening up, then know that a fistula has formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore treat her according to the chapter on female disorders.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back then treat it with what has been described before regarding stitching if it is large, or with dust if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an imprint on the bone and cut off a piece from it then probe the wound and hasten to extract those pieces if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated then leave them until the wound becomes gangrenous because their extraction would be eased.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgement on the treatment of other accidental wounds in the remaining body parts is the same as what we have said before.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	On abdominal wounds, and intestinal protrusions, and their treatment:
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	A rupture of the abdomen is great, medium or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore sometimes from the great [rupture] an intestine emerges or several intestines emerge.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why does this happen? Their introduction is difficult as is their stitching.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small rupture also occurs in another manner.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows therefore that their reduction is made more difficult if you do not hasten to introduce them back into place immediately because they become inflated, opened and enlarged so their entry becomes hard.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a medial disruption is better for ruptures because the reduction of the intestine is not difficult like it is with these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Yes, I am aware that there are four methods of suture for veins.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are suitable for sewing the belly and other wounds of the body, and two other special sutures are specific to other types of wound.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more specific for sewing the belly, and I will explain each of them to you with an explanation and a description.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore that when a wound is small and some of the intestines come out but it is difficult to put them back in, then one of two methods should be used.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the small size of the rupture, as we have said, or because there is a swelling in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When this is the case, you should warm it up by submerging a sponge or a damp cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you could boil it in water with squills, rushes, barley grains, and embrocation until the swelling goes down.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes wine with an astringent effect will do this, and it is better than water alone at reducing the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	Once you see that the swelling has gone down, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or malva have been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	As it soothes its entrance with a small amount of this preparation.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, his recovery is impeded after this treatment, then seek a little more sharpness in the instrument with which you cut the haemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than cutting; and there is no compulsion to cut after the need and failure of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be the single curved sharp part, and let its other part not be sharp, and let its delicate tip not have the fineness of a scalpel, but rather be slightly more blunt; and it is that which resembles chalk, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	Therefore, when the wound is enlarged and it enters the intestine, then it should be reduced back to its natural form in its proper place on itself if possible over that; for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When, however, the rupture is wide in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on their back and put their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then put their head and chest higher than their lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And likewise if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then direct your attention and consider always that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus you ought to administer this for large wounds as well as medium-sized ones.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	For small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then ensure that there is present between your hands a pious assistant who holds the entire rupture with his hand and brings its lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then remove from it for him who follows a piece after a piece: and this is the way of single suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, to take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then withdraw from the edge of the wound a length equal to that of the ring finger of the physician; and fix one needle apart so as to introduce into it thread at both ends of the skin, with two ends of the suture which is under the skin on the inside until you have made it pierce through to the other side, then already will you have brought together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the suture: and there are four threads.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with double thread around the circumference of the needle several times from both sides at once until the two lips of the wound are brought together by a suitable arrangement.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then withdraw the thickness of your finger as well, and fix into them another needle; afterwards straighten it with thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not stop doing this with as many needles as you need until you have completed the binding of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And the needles should be medium between thickness and thinness; since thin needles very quickly pierce flesh and thick ones are difficult to introduce into skin; for this reason it is necessary that they should be of a medium size as regards both thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary to fix the needles in two edges of the skin close together so that flesh may not be quickly pierced and the wound opened up before it has healed; nor do they stretch out with the suture so as to hinder the wound from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the points of the needles so that they may not hurt the patient while he sleeps; and put over them little pads made of linen on every side which keep the ends of the needles in place: and leave them until you know that the wound is already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	This particular type of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since one needle or two or approximately that amount is sufficient for the suture of these (wounds).
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	However, the second type of suture is common, where you gather together with sutures four edges: two edges of skin and two edges of subcutaneous tissue, using a needle that has a thread wrapped around it evenly in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you penetrate with the needle these four edges, bring back the needle from the side where you started it so that the thread forms a loop on top of the wound; this creates a suture similar to the way cloths are tied together by string and place between each part of the suture a small finger's width.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This type of suture is known to people.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this type of suture, I closed the wound of a man who had been wounded with a knife in his belly; it was a large gash about one palm length and there were two palms' worth of intestines protruding from the middle intestine and the tear was located right in the center of his abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I replaced that after his intestines had been hanging outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound therefore healed within about fifteen days; I treated him and he recovered, living many more years after that, going about his own affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors had judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was by miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment or medicine could be found.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore placed an old poultice on the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I shall now describe two types of stitches that are specific to this method, according to the text.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it begins with an acute stitch: you insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle has penetrated through the skin and is entering the flesh along the length and breadth of the entire body: leave one end on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it emerge at the other end from the inside to the outside at the other end of mirach.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	Once you have made it emerge, then make it pass through again at this same mirach end from the outside to the inside: and leave the sifac end that is on this side, and make the needle emerge at the other end from the inside to the outside: and make it go all the way in as you did with the mirach end that is on its part until it goes right through.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then start again from this same side, and suture it with the end that is from sifac on the other side, and pull out the needle from the skin where it went through.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back to that skin, and suture the sifac end which is on the other side with this mirach end: and pull it out from the skin that is on its part, and do one after the other, and another: and do it alternately, until you have stitched all of it completely according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the essence of this suture is to stitch like that of tanning hides where they stitch skins together: so you must suture one end of sifac from one side with an end of the skin; and leave it on the other side alternately until you have completed stitching them all.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of suture is specific, as Galen said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	His speech is told as if he compares it to the way some doctors practice medicine, so that they bring together every part to its corresponding match in nature: and they apply the tip of sifac to one end, and the other end to the tip of mirach.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And it is done as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You must pierce the needle into the tip of mirach near you from the outside and make it penetrate to the inside only; and release the two tips of sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from outside to inside on both tips of sifac, namely on each side.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both of them as well, also make each one penetrate from inside to outside on the other two tips of mirach, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is a suture which came before the reminder.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This speech is therefore also that of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said so.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the abdomen is corrected with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which is to introduce into both a single thread; and begin with the introduction of the needle from what is near you, and make it penetrate all the way to the other side, according to the suture of those who are equally skinned.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen: then its suture is more difficult than that of other parts of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgement of a wound's treatment is the judgement of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Which is because when you treat a fresh wound with its blood, before it is altered by the air; and you clean the intestines, and sew it up, and make it suitable: then place it on incarnantium powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound, then apply some ointments that are available to you until they form pus; and the threads fall out, and the sifac and mirach are consolidated.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as you would other wounds until they heal.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If however you do not have the medicines available, then place an old rag on it immediately as soon as it begins to discharge pus; and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not require any other treatment in many cases when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	However if you fear that the wound will spread to main parts of the body by injury, then you must immerse soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil; and place it around the areas which are between the groin and armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If they feel pain, or pricking sensations, or putridity in their belly (for this often happens), then administer an enema of astringent wine which is black and tepid; especially if the rot has already reached into the stomach, and is about to pierce through to their breast.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And note that that which comes from the large intestines is more easily healed; and that which comes from the small intestines is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine which is called the jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the size of them, and because of the delicacy of its body, and the closeness of its nature to nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If however that which proceeds from the wound is fresh cirrhotic tissue, and you pursue it: return it according to your own reduction method, by which you reduce intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If however time has passed and it has already turned green or black, then you must tie it with a thread above the spot that has darkened from it, so that there is no bleeding.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In cirrhotic tissue there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut off what is beyond that ligament and leave the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it; so as to alleviate the traction on you when extracting cirrhotic tissue, and discharging the pus of the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembrance of the wound that occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there is a rupture in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible for it to be restored in some people; because I saw one who was wounded in their belly by a lance blow, and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and the wound had become old: and a fistula formed, and there was an excretion and flatulence from it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I therefore applied treatment until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to probe it until the site had healed and consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw that the wound was already healed, I feared for my patient that something bad might happen to their abdomen; but nothing of the sort happened to them.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And they remained in a better state of health, eating and drinking, having sex, taking baths, and following their regular routines.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some medical experts have said that when there is a small wound in the intestines, it should be stitched closed in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And you must take ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather the two lips of the wound and place one ant with its mouth open on top of the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it bites down on them and clamps its jaws shut, cut off its head as it will stick there and not let go.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and keep doing this with ants after ants according to the size of the wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	After that, bring it down, and close the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached inside the intestines until they are eaten away by the intestine itself, and it heals up completely without any harm to the patient.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	It is also possible to stitch the intestines together with a thin thread which has been taken from an animal's gut and attached to the needle beforehand.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And you must take one end of this thread from an animal's gut and strip off most of the flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie to its end a thin linen thread wound around it.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then bring it back to ruin.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this way of sewing with ants and intestines is only according to the path of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that a wound which is large and extensive, especially if it is on one of the thinner intestines: then there is no skill but deception, nor is its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Concerning the treatment of fistulae, and abscesses.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that any wound or abscess which becomes old and antiquated, turns into an ulcer, does not heal, and discharges pus always without abating: it is then universally called a fistula wherever the affected member may be, and we call this 'zuchemen'.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	The fistula is in truth a hard, white, filtered knot with which there is no pain; it has the shape of a bird's feather: and because of this some call it 'risati', that is to say, 'feather'.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And there are times when it becomes moist with pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	Perhaps the moisture is discharged at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is large in quantity; and it is small; it is thick, and it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already mentioned in the division when I spoke of wounds that any ulcer which does not heal and on which flesh is not formed - it is because of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One reason is either due to a lack of blood in the body, or because of the malignancy of it, or because there is hard flesh between it and its lips, preventing the birth of flesh; or because it is full of dirt and filth, or because an ulcer within itself is putrid, and the material sent to it is of poor quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because the corruption falling in the region is a type of pestilence, or due to the properties in that region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where diseases are difficult to digest, and nature delays the healing of abscesses; or because there is one bone in it, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already demonstrated all these causes and their signs, along with the cures and medications for each in the division; and here I must make you aware of the cure for Fistula and Zuken, which is done through surgical procedure with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore, you should know that Fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For among them are Fistulae that reach major veins and arteries, or nerves, or the spine; or the intestine, or the bladder, or any of the ribs; or any of the vertebrae in the back, or any composite joints made up of several parts, like the hand and foot; and among them are those which spread towards the proximity of the principal member and its likenesses.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which of these Fistulae is in this condition, is among the diseases difficult to heal, and does not receive a cure, and dealing with it is laborious and ignorant work.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if there is any Fistula whose depth does not reach these places that I have mentioned, and you hope, trust in its cure, and wish to gain knowledge of it, then take a probe made from brass or iron, if the fistula runs straight, and examine it with this.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If there is a twist within the fistula, then examine it with a fine lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because the softness of the metal enables it to bend and conform to twists.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has multiple openings, you cannot mark it out with the probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Flush out each opening with enemas.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the fluid you use for the enema will drain towards other openings and flow out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully determine how you can find out whether there is a bone or nerve inside and if the cavity of the fistula is deep or shallow; or if it is a single fistula with multiple openings and stand over all of these, using all your strength; by questioning the patient and observing the signs and causes of the swelling.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have stood correctly over all of these, then go forward with confidence to healing; and consider at that time whether the fistula is shallow close by or in a safe place far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein or any of the places I mentioned; then cut it open as previously described and remove what is inside it through filtration such as putrid flesh, which forms around its opening, made up of flesh and cellulite-like matter; heal it until it is cured.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If however the fistula is of great depth and runs straight then you must cut it open as deep down as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then clean it from all its putrid flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply lint wrapped in sharp medicines; and insert them as far as the hollow of the fistula that you have grasped with an iron rod: do this a few times until the caustic medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from putrefaction.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If however it does not heal with that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is confirmed to you: then expose it, and cut into it as I have described to you; if nothing prevents you from a vein or nerve, or principal limb, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore you detect bone, and there is something of putrefaction and blackness in it: then scrape it until its putrefaction is entirely removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with something that makes flesh grow in it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal, and emits pus as before; then know that you have not reached the complete removal of putrefaction.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Expose it again therefore, and make an examination of its scraping and cleaning with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If therefore it is healed, that is good; and if not, then know that the putrefaction is in a far-off depth of the body which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	You therefore have no skill in it but to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If a small bone is corrupted and it is possible for you to do so, extract it with fine scissors that correspond to it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then carefully extract them all using your strength and do not leave any behind.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If any of the moistures cause you difficulty and there is no fear or mistake about opening them up: then open those moistures and flesh if they are present there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you are not prepared to remove the bones immediately, then place on the wound something that will cause it to rot: and leave it until those parts around the bones rot away from flesh and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And ensure that the wound does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And the incision you made during your operation should be kept open.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	In my opinion, if you are worried then place on it a poultice of ground sulfur and oil that has been steeped in vinegar; or one steeped in Egyptian ointment, or any of the violet-based ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures rot as expected, and the bones are separated from them, the removal of said parts will be alleviated along with the extraction of the bones themselves.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if it is one large bone, such as a shin bone or hip bone and those similar to them, and what has corrupted it is a large part: then scrape it with an ultimate rasp until the blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is corrupted in it is a large part and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it must be sawn through and cut away entirely up to where the corruption has spread; then treat it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you this story as an example and a guide for your own surgical practice.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man around thirty years of age who experienced pain in his leg due to an internal cause, originating from within the body, until it reached his leg and developed into a large abscess; there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So time passed with the man suffering from medical error until the abscess opened up and a lot of pus came out.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his healing was delayed until his leg became fistulated and developed many openings which all discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	A lot of doctors tried to treat him for about two years but none were skilled in the surgical arts until I was called upon and saw his leg with the great flow of pus issuing from those openings; even now his whole body had wasted away and his complexion was sallow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings and it reached bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings and found that they connected with each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I therefore made an incision and probed over one of those openings until I reached a piece of bone; upon examining it, I found that part to be damaged: already corroded, blackened, rotted, and perforated right through as far as the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore sawed away what I had detected, preparing the remaining bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	I appointed that there was no bone except for the corruption which I cut away and extracted.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied healing medicines to consolidate the restoration of the wound over a long period.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it has not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried again, and found the bone broken a second time like the first break; and I cut away what appeared to me to be yet another part of this corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it has not been restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore I tried again, and did not cease from cutting the bone in pieces and attempting its restoration; but it was not restored until I had cut away about a span of this bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicine and it consolidated quickly and healed; this repetition of the operation would not have been necessary had it not been for the infirm man's weak condition, his lack of tolerance, and my fear over him lest he die: for in every hour from an excess of evacuation he suffered evil swoonings.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore completely healed; hard flesh grew instead of the bone, and a good arrangement was made within his body so that his strength returned; he resumed his usual occupations and no injury resulted from this for him while walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if a prominent bone in the body has already been broken then you must extract it like this; take a bandage and bind it at the end of the protruding bone, make someone lift that part upward while you apply another bandage made from thicker wool than the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it above the flesh that is over the bone; and extend its end so as to pull the flesh towards the lower part, and you uncover the flesh over the place where you wish to saw, so that the saw does not hurt (the flesh).
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood or board under the bone below at an angle; for when you do this, it is not prevented that it cuts the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it must be that the saw is above the corrupted place for a short while, so that corruption does not occur in the cavity of the bone; and (the corruption) does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and forces (one) to use another saw in its stead.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and is not prominent, but its part continues with another part; and the corruption is in its middle or on one of its sides: then uncover all the flesh from all sides completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place a piece of wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	After that, saw it from the first side where the corruption is until the saw reaches the other side; and let the saw be according to the length of the corruption for a little while, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is at the joint, cut that corrupted joint; then saw the bone where it continues from the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if the corruption is at the connection of two joints, then there is no remedy for it except abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is at the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, then the matter with it is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But one must inquire about the corruption in what way does it appear to you?
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And cauterize it, and clean it as best you can according to how it is positioned, and with whatever skill you have: when neither the Vein nor Nerve opposes you.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many knives and saws for cutting these bones, according to the location of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, fineness, size, smallness, hardness, and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you prepare all the instruments of every kind of operation suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations show you the type of instrument required for it when you have plenty of time.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the ways of this art is a sign of the understanding of illnesses; for then you will already find for yourself what suits each illness from among the instruments.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you in this chapter's final section the number of instruments that you keep as examples for what you cut, and as a test by which you experiment on others.
Forma Serrae.	Form of saws.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of the other saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This depiction of the form of the saw is done badly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Its upper part should be arched, its sharpness made of iron; and its handle from boxwood, and let the pyramidal tip be badly made.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Form of scissors with joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	The head of this surgical instrument should be shaped like the head of a star-pated nail, and its points should correspond to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not appropriate unless the heads of the joined bones are rubbed with it when they become corrupted, or a large and extensive bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The shape of the larger surgical instrument.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The shape of the medium-sized surgical instrument.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The shape of the wide surgical instrument.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape of the surgical instrument which has a hollowed-out area.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The shape of another thin surgical instrument.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of the other curved-tipped surgical instrument.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape of the surgical instrument like a pair of thin pincers.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape of the surgical instrument with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape also of the large surgical instrument.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is like a Saw, and its tip is like a Serrated Edge; it is shown in many places concerning bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape of the surgical instrument suitable for dealing with perforated bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its tip is triangular, of sharp points.
Fit ex Indi.	It should be made from Indian steel.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it should be made in the same way for all the surgical instruments, cutting tools, and saws that we have mentioned.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the cutting of bone ends and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The limbs rot, either due to an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When you have treated that corruption with medicinal cure and it does not respond to the treatment, and you see that the corruption spreads into the limb which nothing can save, then you must cut off that limb as far as the spread of corruption reaches so that the patient may emerge from death or a worse disfigurement.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this has happened is when the limb turns black until it seems burnt by fire or rotten after turning black; it must be cut off where the rot reaches to prevent its spread throughout the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, prepare for the incision of it, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures such as the marine scorpion, viper, rutela, and similar animals.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If the corruption or sting is at the tip of a finger, then cut off that finger and do not give space to the corruption so it does not spread into the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	Similarly, if it happens to the hand, then cut off that hand at its root and do not give space to the corruption until it reaches the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades that part then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption has spread beyond the elbow, then the patient is doomed to death.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And treating that besides with curative measures is an exercise in futility.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	Similarly, if the corruption invades a toe then cut it off at one of its joints; but if it reaches the instep then amputate the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it rises to the knee, then make an incision in the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill [to be employed] but to give up and leave the sick person to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	The method of making an incision into a limb or sewing it up is to tighten the sinew below where you wish to make the incision; and then tighten another sinew above that place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And the attendant should stretch one of these sinews downwards; and the other attendant should stretch the upper sinew upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between these two sinews with a broad spatule until all of it has been uncovered.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then make your incision or sew it up.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And you should place a piece of linen cloth around all the parts [of the wound] and do not let the needle touch healthy skin; this will otherwise cause added injury to the sick person and hot abscesses.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If there is a gush of blood internally as you are working on it, then cauterise the place quickly; or put some styptical powders upon it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medicating until you have completed the task.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind up the wounded limb with suitable bindings, and take care of it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you that this same accident happened to a man in his foot.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is because his foot was afflicted by a blackening like a burn which resembles the effect of fire; and this corruption first began on his toe before it spread to take over the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	The man therefore prepared himself, after seeing that the injury was affecting his limb with its severity which he found through pain and burning sensation; it affected him at the joint, but then he healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long period of time passed, the same injury occurred to him in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I tried to remove the excess with him by using medicines which I placed on his hand after cleaning his body; however, it did not drain away, and began to move into another finger until the injury affected his entire hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He therefore called for me to amputate his hand; I refused to do it, hoping that the excess could be drained by me, and also fearing death in relation to an amputation of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Since the man's condition was advanced.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he had lost hope in me, he returned to his land; and he reached out for help from me because he prepared himself and amputated his entire hand, and then healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	I have not related this account except as a guide for those who suffer from this type of injury; and to indicate what can be indicated, and how it should be treated.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, and the nature of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in some fleshy parts and the duration of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus; then it ruptures or perforates, and what is inside of it, from the pus, comes out leaving an empty space like a vessel, and the skin over it is like cloth that has been worn thin: if it does not reach its ultimate stage in terms of corruption where it affects bone, nerve or ligament, it should be called a hemorrhoid; but if prolonged until the infection reaches one of these parts, then it may be called an abscess or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is to cut that skin completely as it peels off; especially when it has thinned and become like a cloth; and you trust that it will not stick to the wound due to its own decay.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will stick and it does not follow from this ultimate attachment; and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with enemas; and it is necessary to pay attention to the abdominal cavity.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large and the pus emitted from it has a foul odor; then enema it with Egyptian medicine, which consists of equal parts vinegar, oil, and ziniar, combined in a jar; boil them over fire until the medicine reddens; and becomes as thick as honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take as much of it as you need; and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the abdominal cavity with it; compress its opening, and leave the medicine in for about two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressure; do this for as many days as necessary until the abdominal cavity is cleansed and the stench is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes enema with water of ashes when this medicine is not available to you; and it is necessary to take the ash of grapevine wood, or the ash of holm oak wood; and throw it into the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then mix it well, and enema with it until you trust that the abdominal cavity is now cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	But if the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, then enema them with water and honey mixed with a small amount of crushed ziniar.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or use an enema made with honey and wine mixed together, since the nature of honey is to cleanse and wash away impurities; and the wine makes the membrane adhere - especially when there is excess astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times and are confident that the corruption of the membrane has been removed, then use an enema made with whatever promotes flesh growth.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is good to take some dyaphinion plaster and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or use an enema made with certain other medicines and salves whose properties I have described in the book on salves.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	But if the membrane's opening is tight and will not admit the enema pipe, then stretch it a little with an iron instrument; or apply to it linen wrapped around a stick that has been dipped in Egyptian ointment, or in royal ointment, until it is stretched.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly, if the opening is also wide, then draw its lips together with a stitch; and leave as much of it outside as the enema tube can enter without difficulty.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is raised towards the top, then cut it lower down on its own surface so that the pus can flow out downward; for when pus is confined within the depth of the membrane, it prevents flesh from forming there.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But if you cannot conveniently cut the membrane just below where you wish, then try to prepare the member in such a way that the pus will flow out easily as it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to ensure that no pus is retained in it at all; and take the consolidating medicines which are applied to wounds, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that it covers the entire bosom (breast).
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then make an incision with the scissors along the edge of the breast opening slightly beyond the nipple.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread another soft ointment on the cloth according to the size of the nipple hole; and place it over the breast in a position away from the nipple opening so as to ease the outflow of pus from it: and do not remove the large cloth unless after some days have passed.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But the one that is over the breast opening, is the one you remove every hour, so that what has collected in it of pus may flow out: and so that you know whether the fluid flowing from it is a lot or a little; digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you re-examine the breast itself, consider whether its owner feels pain in it or not; and whether there is a boil on it or no boil.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment has progressed thus and you see the material which comes out over the breast opening, then you know that the breast now adheres or is close to adhering; then therefore remove it in the morning or on the third day: and when you are removing the wound, then change to another cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if a refined fluid emerges from the breast after a long time has passed, then do not despair of its adhering, for its healing is approaching; because there are people who delay the growth of flesh in their wounds, and some act contrary to it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if undigested pus emerges from the breast after many days, then you know that the breast is not adhering.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolongs, then add to the drying medications, but let the physicians ensure that the medicines are moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as dyaphyinicon ointment when excess fat is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the very last part that is treated, it is such that you should take dyaphyinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and moisten over it an equal amount of old wine by substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then prepare it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it now acts similarly to this procedure, when dyaphyinicon ointment is not present to you, use honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense: pound everything, and powder it over honey while it's over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread over it a cloth and bind it on the sinus: and spread over it the honey that you boiled until it thickens: and powder over it spices, and put over the cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes it is administered with long birthwort, and roots of heavenly lily, and lily: and herb flour, and centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use these simples, or aggregate them, pound them, and sieve them: and powder over the honey I described, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if the condition of the sinus prolongs and it does not heal with this cure, then know that there is corruption within its depth: or it now causes an impression in the bones, or other hard tissues, or ligaments: then treat it with the cure for Fistulas, as stated before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On treating panaritium, nail attrition, finger incisions and amputations.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 141.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A panaritium is an abscess that develops under the nail of the thumb or toe, and it may occur on other fingers as well.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	If it is left untreated and the condition persists, the abscess may become an aposteme that fills with pus; or it may rot and discharge pus until it eats away at the nail bed, potentially corrupting the entire finger, reaching the bone, causing a foul smell, turning the fingertip wide and discoloured.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you treat it as we mentioned earlier and the treatment does not take effect, then you must use a knife to cut away all of the remaining excess from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterise the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Indeed, hot cauterisation is very beneficial.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	However, if the bone is sound and both nail bed and root are healthy, but excess nail growth now presses against flesh deeper down, piercing it or hurting it, then you should place a thin probe under the corner of the nail that pierces into the flesh and push it upwards; cut this flesh away gently and apply to what remains of the flesh any burning, corrosive medicine until all is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the infection has already reached the bone, then you must cut away and remove that bone; for it will never heal so long as the infected bone remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see decay and deterioration progressing into the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	However, if there is a nail injury or blow, and severe pain occurs, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first with cupping glasses.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with an acute spatule by making a cross-section from above downwards.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	Watch out that the cutting does not reach the flesh underneath the nail, for you will cause severe pain to occur in the patient, and it may result in an addition of flesh at the site due to growth of new tissue.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the site with something that will relieve pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	However, the extra finger that appears on some hands of people may be entirely fleshy; and there are bones in some of them, and a nail is present in some: and some of them appear at the base of the joint, or their origin lies in the joints of the digit.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	The one that appears in the joints of a digit does not move; but the one that arises at the joint of two digits may possibly be movable.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the sectioning is easy for the one among them that is fleshy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, cut it at its base with a broad spatule.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, the treatment of the one whose origin is at the base of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Refrain therefore from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	However, in the case of one born with an extra digit near the last joint, you must first cut their flesh with a round incision until you reach the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone using one of those saws suitable for this purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	After that, treat it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However, the joining together of fingers which happens either because of birth defects, or from wound healing, or burns from fire, and similar conditions.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is therefore necessary to cut this joining together of fingers until they return to their original form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them strips of linen or cloth soaked in rose oil, so that they do not heal quickly and separate them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the wound has healed as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if joining occurs between some of the fingers and the palm, then cut this joining as is prepared and appropriate for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Concerning the treatment of disfigurements by incision:
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are twisted, swollen veins full of melancholy humours which appear on many parts of the body; and their outcomes most often occur in the legs, especially those of walkers and workers, and bearers of heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is therefore necessary to administer several strong bleedings in order to remove the black bile.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then use leeches on the patient's veins.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these conditions with iron is done in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One way is to make incisions and extract the black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	Another method is to raise the vein and remove it entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The incision is made in this way.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Soak the leg first with hot water until the thick, dirty blood dissolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of their hip to just below the knee with a cloth.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut open the vein at one place or two or three places with broad incisions.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise it, that is, extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg to above and let the patient's attendant first stop the bleeding with a cauterizer.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail down to the quick until you see that enough blood has come out and as much as the patient can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	After that bind it and tell the patient to avoid foods which produce black bile; repeat the evacuation of the bowels and bloodletting when the veins fill up again and harm the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	Its raising is done in this way.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the patient's leg if there is much hair on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Alternatively put the patient in a bath or else soak their leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins stand out or let him exercise vigorously with strong movement if no bath is available until his limbs are warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin with a straight incision along the vein's length: either at its end near the knee or on its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks and scrape the vein from all sides until it becomes apparent to the touch; you will know that this is so when you see it become red, gradually turning black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	As such, once it has come out of the skin, you see that it is white like a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert a rod under it until you see that when raised, it comes out of the skin; suspend it gently with a blunt hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another incision close to that first incision, three fingers away from it.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin above the vein until it becomes apparent to the touch.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise it with rods as you did before, and then suspend it with another hook just like what was done first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another incision or more incisions if you need to do so.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then raise it up and then make the last incision near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the incision above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	Do this until you pull it out of the top incision or any higher ones until it comes out fully; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you when pulling and raising, then insert a needle with a strong thread twice through it and tie it, then pull it out; or put a rod under it: turn your hand in all directions until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And take care not to cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if you do cut it, it becomes difficult for you to raise it greatly, and it enters the patient from that harm.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	So when you have extracted it all: then place over the wound a piece of wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or just oil; and tend it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	But if the vein is twisted, having a turn to the sides, and is not as we said straight: then you should cut over it on all sides of its twist, and the places of its folding.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you raise it all; and take care at your cutting over it not to cut the vein or injure it: for it will be difficult for you to raise or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of the occurrence by which a vein is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Form of the blind incision.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have the curvature of other incisions, nor is it sharp-ended so as not to wound the vein; and it is thick, curved, and soft: for if it were thin, its thinness would cut into the vein; rather let there be superfluous thickness to it, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the thigh vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs; and also in dry, hot lands with little moisture: that is to say, those where neither grass nor tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it generates in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is indeed from the putrefaction that occurs beneath the skin, just as it happens within the bodies of snakes and roundworms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the onset of this condition is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the area should be cauterized.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from that place of cauterization, like the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When its end becomes visible, you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing between one and two drachmas and tie it with string; then leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	So whenever anything comes out of it to the outside, wrap that in lead and tie it up.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	But if it extends for a long time, then cut off that section and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it off entirely until it has completely emerged.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it off, it contracts and enters the flesh; this causes an abscess to form, as well as decay in that place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it should be handled gently and drawn out little by little until it has emerged completely, leaving nothing of it inside the body; this vein emerges from some people to a length of five and ten palms.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	He has now arrived with a wound that measures twenty palms in length.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it happens to you at the time of your treatment: then insert a rod into its hole and pierce it with a long hole, with a body, until all that is inside it has been evacuated; and apply the rotting of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with treatment for boils.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And indeed this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle joint or on the foot itself; and it happens to have multiple openings, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Treat it therefore as we have said above, and with what has been mentioned before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	On the operation for worms generated under the skin, which is called bovina disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called bovina disease in a certain region among us; because it often happens to cattle and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it penetrates the entire body, going up and down; and it can be felt during its movement from one limb to another until it bursts through wherever it ruptures a place on the skin and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the rotting of certain fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As happens with worms and snakes, that is, earthworms, and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its evil.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it enters the body and is elevated to the head, and reaches its place, then perhaps it opens up there and exits, destroying the eye; and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	How then do you want to cure him and extract it, then that won't happen unless during his walk and the appearance of its symptoms.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is therefore necessary to tie up what is above him and what is below with a strong binding ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	But if it is buried in the flesh and you do not find it, then place a hot iron on the spot until he dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater fear is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind beneath it the eyelid with a good bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And the patient must use cleansing of his body with medicines that dissolve harmful putrid fluids.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he should beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the incision for Nakir's disease.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in some limbs, then shifts from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have indeed seen it, as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in some villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And I found her arm swollen, and I saw slight inflammation in the vein of the biceps tendon.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I stayed for an hour, I saw one inflammation advancing with little sparks, like a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder faster than it is possible; as if it were live silver running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain receded from that spot, and was fixed in her shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and it rushed into the rest of her body until it reached her other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was revolving through her entire body, just as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed at the speed of its transition from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed, I had never before seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who find that their pain shifts from limb to limb; and I have not witnessed it with my own eyes as I did with this woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is anything other than the fact that she was among those from dry villages whose veins are easily spotted; therefore, this shift in sensation appears windy to them.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that this not appear according to this reasoning for those who are luxurious and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you wish to cure her, and the patient feels this pain; then if it is visible to your eye as we have said, then squeeze firmly above it, and underneath it quickly; and cut over it until the windiness escapes, constrained; and cauterize the spot.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you cannot see it with your own eyes: then treat it with a shaking of the body, and with that which dispels viscous substances, and let it purge them with foul pills, and with pills made from serapin, and similar substances.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows vary according to their types, and according to the places in which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is such that among them are some which have large barbs, and small ones: hollow, and solid.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And there are those which have three edges.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And from these some have barbs.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And there are those which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those which fall according to the limbs into which they fall are of two kinds.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either the limbs are from the hollow principal members, such as the brain, and heart, and spleen, and lungs, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar organs.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When it falls into one of these limbs, and you see the signs of death that I will tell you about afterwards, then you must avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many situations.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For the signs from the brain when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and emerges from the fontanel which is above the brain, are: for violent pain occurs to him, and dimming of vision, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and a red tongue, and spasms, and clouding of intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out through the nose, or the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And possibly speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And out of the place of the wound comes forth white moisture resembling pus.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And from it emerges flesh of similar consistency.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then desist from the cure, and extract the arrow if it has not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow having struck the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and he feels with his hand as though it were fixed in something hard, not empty.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the pulse; and black blood flows from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And it is followed by coldness of the limbs, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	You should therefore know that death has surely set in.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow having struck the lung is the emergence of foamy blood from the wound; and the veins which follow around the neck become swollen, and the colour of the patient changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he emits a great, deep sigh; and seeks to draw in cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow strikes the membrane that is in the chest, then it is near the lower ribs; and there is great panting with severe pain, together with a sigh; and all parts of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps undigested food comes out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly and lodges there: some feces may exit from the wound, or a bladder, or intestines that have already been perforated.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore there is no hope of curing him, nor of extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if the arrow falls into the bladder and urine escapes from it: and something comes out to the exterior, and the pain is more intense above the wounded person: then you know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining body parts, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder blade, collar bone, spine, hip, leg and similar members can be saved according to many different treatments when the arrow has not struck an artery or nerve, and is not poisonous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen regarding these arrows so that it may guide your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is to say, an arrow fell into the eye of a man, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So I extracted it from the other side, beneath his ear fat; and he was cured without any damage to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which had fallen into the fat of his eye beneath his lower eyelid; and already it was hidden, but I could only grasp its small tip attached to its shaft: this arrow was large among Turkish archery arrows with a rounded head lacking ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	So the Jew was cured without any bad accident happening to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	The arrow was Arabic, and it belonged to him who has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore I secured the arrow between two guide wires above it, and by then it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I thus operated with care until I extracted it; and the Christian was cured.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the man who had fallen on it; and we thought he would die from that.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed and nothing in his condition changed, I therefore secured the arrow above it; and I applied ingenuity to this [arrow] and extracted it; he was cured, and no misfortune befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw the man who had fallen on an arrow in his back, and the wound over it was healed.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years had passed, the arrow came out at his hip's root.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman who had fallen on an arrow in her belly; and the wound over it was healed, and the arrow remained inside of her: and none of her conditions changed, nor did she find any harm to herself by any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man who had fallen on an arrow in his face; and the wound was healed but it remained there without causing him much pain; and many similar things like this.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from the chief among the king's men which had fallen on him at the middle of his nose and already it bent a little bit towards the right; and all of the arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called to treat him after the arrow wound for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found therefore that the arrow wound was very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	So I examined it with a thin probe, and did not feel it; yet he himself discovered the puncture and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped therefore that it was a puncture from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	So I dressed the place with a plaster which had an attracting and digesting power, hoping that the spot would become sore and reveal to me the sign of the arrowhead so that I might cut over it; but nothing happened in this place to indicate that the arrow-head was there.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I kept dressing it for many days with the same plaster; and nothing happened, but meanwhile the wound healed up; and he remained weak from the extraction over a space of some days until one day he felt an arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me about it.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I therefore placed a sharp corrosive medicine on the wound for many days until it was opened; and with the probe I probed inside it, and felt the thin end of the arrow-head which was sticking into some wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound by means of that sharp medicine until the end of the arrow-head became visible to us; and this process took about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound had been made wider and it was possible for me to introduce a pair of forceps into it and move them about without success; I did not desist from contriving and planning means of extracting it with various instruments until one day I began upon it with a specially-made pair of forceps, which will be described at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I healed the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed doctors judge that the nose cartilage does not heal.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I therefore healed it, and the wound was consolidated, and the patient was cured completely; nor did anything harm him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the process of extracting certain arrows, so that you may place that rule and its significance over what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not covered together with the narration; nor does a book comprehend it, and a prudent artisan compares little things to great ones: and what is present, to that which is absent; and finds new methods, and new instruments for the problems of unfamiliar cases in this art when they arise.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that arrows do not come out of the members in which they are fixed unless according to two methods.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by pulling it from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by pushing from the opposite side of the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out where it entered is either an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place; and it is pulled, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not obey and come out of the hour that it fell, then you must leave it for a few days until the flesh around it becomes rotten; and its pull is eased, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed into a bone and does not obey you to come out, then leave it for some days too; and repeat pulling on it and moving it every day until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you with an exit after a day, then you must perforate around the arrow on the very bone from all sides using a fine trephine until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then pull it out, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed into the bone of the head and has already penetrated one ventricle of the brain, and there appear in the sick person some of those accidents which I mentioned, then desist from pulling out the arrow, and abandon it until its level becomes even after a day.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the Sifach, then death will not be prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed except into the body of a bone only and does not penetrate all the way to the Sifach, and he remains sick for some days without any of those accidents happening to him, then exercise your skill in pulling out the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed very firmly and does not obey you to be pulled out, then apply the trephine around the arrow as I have described; afterwards treat the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow is already concealed within some part of the body where it escapes the sense of feeling, then search for it with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	But if you feel it, then pull it out using some instruments that are suitable for pulling it out.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you cannot manage it because of the tightness of the wound and because of the length of the arrow being deep inside; and there is no bone or nerve or vein in that place to prevent you: then wait over it until the wound widens, and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If there are ears to which it is attached, then free the flesh fixed on them from every side and by all means you can do so, and use tricks if you cannot without tearing away the flesh at the fracture of the ears, and twisting them until they come out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the arrow extraction in any place it is located, then use your hand to twist and scissors for all parts until you make it come out: and with extreme caution so as not to break the arrow, which would make its retrieval difficult.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot remove it within an hour, then leave it for a few days until the tissue around it becomes rotten.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try again to remove it: the pain will have subsided by then. If the bleeding is a problem for you, then perform what we said regarding treatment in its own chapter. And take care with your skill so as not to cut an artery or nerve.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And apply every trick you can to remove the arrow as easily and calmly as possible, with slowness and strength just as I have described it for you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And you must make sure that the patient is positioned during arrow extraction in just as they were when shot by it.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it will be of greater benefit to them.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If that is not possible for you then apply what is possible according to the positioning of the patient.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	If the arrow is exiting from another part of the body or something has already emerged to the outside, or if you see that a bulge is forming at the end of the arrow through your senses on the upper side of nearby skin: cut above it and make an incision large enough to fit scissors into.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it out; for it now becomes easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is retained within the bone, then turn your hand according to its curvature until the arrowhead embeds itself into the bone and widens; subsequently, pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for several days; then try again until it exits.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow shaft is within her, push it out with that too.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If the shaft has fallen out but you wish to administer a push: then introduce into it an implement with a concave end so that its cavity may encompass the tail of the arrowhead; subsequently, push it along with the latter.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If, however, the arrowhead is concave: push it along with an instrument entering into its concavity.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	Indeed, for the latter will alleviate the pain of the arrowhead's exit.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrowhead is poisoned, it is necessary to scoop out all the flesh containing the poison; if you are able to do so.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with whatever is suitable for its healing.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrowhead is lodged in the chest, or abdomen, or thigh, or side; and it can be reached with your probing fingers, and you are able to cut above it: then do so, being mindful of any veins or nerves that may lie nearby, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew up the wound if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps with which arrowheads may be extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The extremities are like a bird's beak, which have been made like iron: when they grasp the arrowhead, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And they come in many shapes and sizes: large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrowhead, its smallness, the width of the wound, and its tightness.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape is that of an impelling concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape is that of a deafening impulse.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the deaf extremity like a wedge, so as to ease its entry into the concave arrowhead and drive it with itself.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this concave impulse is concave like a bird's feather, so as to ease the arrowhead's entry into it and its impelling force with itself.

Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a broad lancet.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However it ought not to be that the lancet is of a sharp point like other lancets, but rather of a broad point.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And let the lancet be passed across it according to its direction: for the bone is near: and perhaps therein the lancet will break when it is thin.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	On venesection of the veins in two lachrymals.

Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	For the vein does not appear there to the sense [of touch], but because blood starts flowing immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And you should keep your hand [on the lancet] to some extent; draw as much blood as is necessary for you.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	On the bloodletting of the jugular veins, by Algaberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	Algaberich's bloodletting instruments for the jugular veins are useful because they help with bad breath and gum infection; malignant sores; and lip cracks as well as malignant sores on the nose or around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	The quality of those bloodletting instruments is such that you should make the patient sit before you and tighten their neck with a cord.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then roll back their lip and look at the two veins - one from the right side of their lip, and another from its left; you can see both by the blackness they display on either side.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And it is true that around them are small, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Make an incision on both sides with an incising instrument.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if there is doubt about which one it is, and you do not know which one it is, then direct your attention to the greater of them and the more obvious ones.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And likewise do the same with regard to the two veins that are in the upper lip, and it is indeed customary for this to be done; and make an incision on both of the veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	On bloodletting from the vein beneath the tongue after bloodletting from the cephalic vein.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Bloodletting from the two veins beneath the tongue is beneficial for relief of swellings that are in the throat, and diseases of the uvula, and disorders of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the manner of bloodletting from them is that the patient should sit between your hands in front of the sun; and lift their tongue, and look beneath the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for another vein: and note that the colour of each has turned towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Bloodlet from both; and be careful not to press your hand too hard when bloodletting from them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For beneath it are arteries, and perhaps there may be a gushing of blood from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	Now the three veins from which blood is customarily let in the elbow are those from which bloodletting has become customary among all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And venesection on these can be done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by pricking with a broad myrtle-stick venesector; or with an oil flask inclined to fineness; or by cutting with the knife type venesector which is called alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form:
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Alnesil is thus that which suits the operation of cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are broad types, and fine ones according to the width of veins and their constriction. The form of the myrtle stick venesector is broad as you can see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening hollow veins, full of blood, protruding and visible ones; thick veins too those which contain thick, murky blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this venesector is of lesser breadth and finer at the tip.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for venesection of fine veins which contain thin yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On basilic venesection.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	And the basilic vein, which is one of these three venesection veins.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it extracts blood from illnesses under the throat and neck, of what follows after breast down to the belly; and it is suited for a skilled venesector with their instrument to be careful about it, and be above fear of it because underneath it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	So if they make an error and add to the venesector's incision, they will cut that artery, and there results a gushing of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, one should not perform a venesection on her with a sharp lancet; instead, let it be done by cutting with alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If it does not appear as a clear manifestation in the basilica, then one must remove others from it and change to another location; or seek some offshoot of it, or perform a venesection at its place on the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is indeed manifest, and cut it with the lancet anesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish to locate the vein itself, then one must feel around for a spot in front of the tightness [?] of the arm until you identify the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with a cauterizing iron; afterwards cut the arm and cut [?] the vein with a concave incision using the lancet alnesil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful that no percussion falls through space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that, as you tighten the binding, there is swelling at the spot marked by the cauterizing iron, then this swelling is of the artery; therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	But if you see blood rising during the venesection like a child's urine and it is thin, red blood; then you know that it is from arterial blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then hurry and place your finger over that long space, then remove it.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If the flow of blood is arrested (for it often is), then bind the arm and let it be; and caution the patient against moving; and reassure them about their fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And it should not move for several days until healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood is not cut off and it overpowers you: and there is no medicine available for you at that moment, then open the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its ends contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of pistachio and pound it: take one half, and bind it over the place where you are binding the vein appropriately, with a bandage and lint until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with what preceded the mention of the place where the removal of the flow of blood originated: and its cutting off of blood is not difficult in many cases because of the small location of the wound, and possibility of binding from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On the phlebotomy of the dark vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	As for the dark vein of phlebotomy, its function is to draw blood from the upper part of the head and lower part of the body: because it consists of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the phlebotomist to be above fear from its phlebotomy, because beneath it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	Therefore if he adds to the puncture of its phlebotomy and finds a nerve, numbness occurs in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it may not heal completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If it is hidden in certain people and is subtle, and does not show itself, then you must make an incision with your phlebotomy tool where you want to remove the abscess, along with a cut using alnesil, and avoid nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then open up the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Regarding the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The cephalic vein phlebotomy is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and helps alleviate eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	In this vein specifically, if you wish to perform a phlebotomy, it is best to do so by pricking with an olive-wood or myrtle-wood phlebotomist tool, as it is safer than all other veins since there are no arteries or nerves underneath.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, when performing a phlebotomy, it is advisable to avoid the start of the forearm with your phlebotomist tool and look for a softer spot; if not found on the first try, repeating the procedure multiple times will not harm them.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps an abscess forms in some people when not lanced on the first strike but this abscess does no harm to them.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of phlebotomy and precautions to be observed during it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy and its complications from which you must think about remedying it.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First and foremost, you must know that a phlebotomy is not administered unless it preserves health, sustains its endurance, and protects from illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And to perform a phlebotomy on one of the three veins that are found at the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Thumbs, and the Basilic vein.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And to perform a phlebotomy at the beginning of spring while fasting and also during summer; likewise autumn, and winter after a meal when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And to perform a phlebotomy on the first day or third day after three hours have passed since the last meal was taken.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	A phlebotomy administered for illness does not have a set time; rather it is done when the situation and necessity call for it to be performed at night or day, and during any hour of the day and every season.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary for boys to undergo the procedure until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	A pregnant woman should not undergo the procedure from her fourth to seventh month of pregnancy.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Neither should elderly people who have reached or passed sixty years of age undergo the procedure.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When a person wishes to undergo the procedure for any reason, they must cleanse their intestines beforehand with an enema; if there is hardened faeces in them, so that during the procedure, the veins will not draw from the intestine harmful impurities which damage major organs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should the procedure be performed on a patient who is afflicted with nausea and discomfort following a meal; or one suffering from inebriation or hangover until these conditions have passed.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor should it be performed on a patient suffering from dropsy (edema).
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And the procedure must not be performed repeatedly after a case of colic pain, vomiting, abdominal flux, excessive sexual intercourse, labour or other physical exertion; nor during a period of restlessness, fasting, and any circumstance that causes depletion of one's vitality from either body or mind.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if it is possible for him to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then he should enter the bath, if nothing prevents it; or engage in some form of exercise to refine the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place the phlebotomy on his chest around the third hour of the day, as we have said; and try to evacuate from his chest that day all bad animal incidents: such as distress, anger, fear; and all bodily incidents, such as labor, pain, excessive sexual intercourse, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And he should make available to himself those things from which custom has driven away the use of men on account of their bitterness, smell and touch, and similar things as far as possible in quantity.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the bloodletter should sit on a cushion that is higher than the patient's mattress; afterwards he should extend his arm and rub it twice or thrice with his own hand.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then bind the ligature with straps and roll them around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	The binding should be moderate, because when the binding is uneven or excessive it prevents the flow of blood; likewise with too little binding.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	After the binding it is necessary for the patient to rub his hands together until the veins fill and become apparent to sight.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the bloodletter should wipe the phlebotomy with a little oil, which is old and his own.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then the bloodletter should place his left index finger on the vein beneath the site of the intended phlebotomy, lightly; so that the vein does not escape and the strike is not broken.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because from the veins you find one like a string that escapes during bleeding; and of these is one which is full of windiness: and when you place the lancet upon it, it contracts under the lancet, and deceives the blood-letter, and the lancet does not open the vein; and if it opens it, it is tight: therefore, for this reason it is necessary that the blood-letter be made firm, and be solicitous in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then put down the lancet.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened with one thrust, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat that thrust with another a little below or above the same place quickly; if the spot does not blanch.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	But if it blanches or the patient grows faint, then let him rest one day, or two days; and do not bind up tightly.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps it will draw out heat as a pustule.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should one enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat bloodletting if he desires it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	But if the opening is small or blood flows slowly; and you fear that not enough blood will come out: then repeat the lancet in the same hole according to its straightness, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it quickly before the spot blanches; for indeed a blanched spot is found in many men during small procedures.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see that it is already blanched, then do not repeat on it at all; for nothing excuses you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	Place on it a bit of oil residue: for it eases the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And honey is better in this place than oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	Likewise, apply oil residue to all your bloodlettings where you cut veins in order to prevent the flow of blood; and make that with alfarah ointment and sagzene when one of them is placed on a spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood becomes thinner and dissolves when it's thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	But if a large abscess occurs at the bloodletting site - which often happens, especially for those who haven't been bled before or have a small vein opening - then hurry and place over the spot a sponge soaked in warm water and salt; press it there for an hour: since it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And you must do this after the blood's stopped flowing from that vein itself or from another.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If some blackness or greenness remains in the spot after a few days that's not harmful; and if you wish to apply over it something of aloe or dissolved myrrh; or anything of mint juice, which is called calamint or similar.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And indeed abscesses and swellings often occur near the Basilica's bloodletting.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Place your hand over it; then if you find softness under your pressure on it, that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore take care to place over it something of what we've said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps arterial blood will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for him with that which has astringency, so that the area hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat himself with the remaining treatment until he is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And you must take from everyone blood according to the quantity of their strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears in color over the blood is victorious.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it exit until it turns red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then let it go until it becomes thin; and likewise, if it is sharp, let its sharpness be removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full and strong but needs the extraction of blood to have one vein enlarged so that a wide phlebotomist can be applied; and let this be the opposite case for someone who is weak.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract blood from the veins and let there be a narrow opening; and what is best in venesection is that there should be a cross incision instead of puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from excessive bleeding and nerve injury; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than venesection that extends in breadth or length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for him who is accustomed to fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary that he be fed before phlebotomy with a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice; or boiled spinach if it's heated; and take from his blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold constitution, then let him take before bloodletting bread soaked in a warm sugar syrup or in an aromatic honey syrup with spices, or one that has fragrance.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If syncope occurs during bloodletting and the cause of it is excessive loss of blood; then one should take a drink of meat broth and delicate fragrant syrup, and use aromatic scents with aloes and wrap their chest with it: and they may apply all other remedies mentioned in chapter ‘syncope’ for evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to cure their arm and release blood a second time: it is necessary that someone who has undergone phlebotomy for evacuation with abundant loss of blood but whose strength is weak should release their blood little by little according to the quantity of his strength over several continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wishes to cure their arm and release blood a second time and whose body is strong should do so after seven or nine hours from the first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from their body towards the opposite side to which it inclines should have this done on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In a body in which blood has already become heated and thickened causing fever to occur; it is necessary that the blood be let once only and with much quantity extracted: and the opening should be enlarged until syncope occurs after you have observed all conditions of phlebotomy: and as you place your hand over their pulse near where the blood courses so that death does not come in lieu of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	It often happens thus when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And when you wish to cure the arm and release blood a second time after the opening of the vein has been closed making it difficult for blood to flow out: one must not press hard upon it nor quickly extend with curvature.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For it is a very bad illness, indeed, so leave it alone until it has been bled for a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove that clot of blood from the opening of the vein with a sharp probe and put over it some salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put over it some of the ointment called alfaroch or sagzene and place a gentle compression on it until blood begins to flow out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the vein has already developed an abscess then leave it alone and do not cauterize it until the abscess has subsided.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If however you are compelled to draw off the blood a second time and there is no excuse for not doing so then either bleed it above that place or on the other arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The arm is bled at the place of the cubit and basilica when these are not found but hidden because it consists of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of that bleeding is such that the sick person should immerse his hand in warm water until the wrist turns red and the vein appears plainly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then bind over it with a bandage that has medium tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then bleed it by means of a crosswise incision gradually, not lengthwise nor width-wise; and let your opening be wide and make the bleeding such as to cover part of the joint of the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	But if the blood is prevented from flowing then immerse the hand again in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you have accomplished your purpose.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however you are in summer days, then you are excused from repeating the handwashing with warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And it is most important to immerse the blood vessel in hot water during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the bloodletting of this vein is safer than all others, since there is no pulsating vein beneath it nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Bloodletting from the little finger of the right hand, however, is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	The quality of this bloodletting is such that you should first bind the patient's arm tightly with a ligature or with your hand, after dipping it into hot water, until the vein has filled and becomes very obvious to touch.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then bloodlet from that same spot with a transverse incision.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely through, it will not harm the patient at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And take care to not leave your hand on top of the bloodletting knife afterwards.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under it, in fact, lie the nerves of the fingers stripped bare of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return the hand to hot water again and let the blood run out into it freely.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return the hand to hot water, blood will clot at the mouth of the vein and hinder its flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	Once you have extracted the required amount of blood, then put oil and salt on top of the vein so that it does not close up quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise it is necessary to do this with any tight ligature as well.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The instrument for his phlebotomy, however, is on the left hand, as it is suitable for spleen ailments; and do likewise with his phlebotomy as you did with the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The instrument for saphenous phlebotomy is useful for ailments in the lower part of the body, such as uterine diseases, and menstrual retention, kidney problems, old ulcers on hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that the patient should immerse his foot in warm water and massage it until the veins become prominent; then bind above the ankle with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	The veins indeed have their location near the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and many branches spread out from it on the surface of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, perform the phlebotomy on its wider branch or near the heel at its convergence point; for it is better and safer so.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	But if you bleed it on the surface of the foot, then take care to avoid the nerves which are beneath it under the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy so that you bleed it across the vein as if you wish to cut it; and let the phlebotomy be a Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the outflow of blood is hindered, then immerse his foot again in warm water and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotomy instrument misses the vein at first attempt, repeat with the phlebotomy slightly above, for it is a safe place and you need not fear any harm when avoiding nerves as mentioned before.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the other foot's saphenous vein equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The place of the sciatic veins, as we said, is at the heel on the outer side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of its bloodletting is for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the manner of its bloodletting is that the patient should enter a bath and hurry; and have their legs compressed on the side of the hip to above the heel by four fingers with a thin long bandage: for it is not evident unless because of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it is therefore evident, then bloodlet that vein however you find possible, or according to its direction: and it is better, either by cutting it with an incision, or severing it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its place is safer, and itself is very hidden in most people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it, and it does not at all appear to sight: then bloodlet one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot towards the ankle; and avoid the nerves, and let as much blood run out as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the binding, and place leather over the site of bloodletting, and bind the site.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On Cupping, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cupping glasses are made of horn, and of brass, and of glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And cupping is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and bloodletting: the other is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping that is without scarification, is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the cupping sites that are applied with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	One of which is cupping on the forehead, and it is at the back of the head; Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and Alhagdahim cuppings, and they are two layers of the neck from both sides together; and mentum cupping, and it is under the jaw below the mouth; and two spatula cuppings; and Alachosos cupping at the end of the spine; and two bowl cuppings, and they are in the middle of two arms; and two leg cuppings; and two spoon cuppings.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And cupping does not extract blood from the small veins scattered throughout the flesh, and because of that, there is no loss of strength from it as happens with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it appropriate to apply cupping with fire or without fire for any illnesses that arise from congestion until the entire body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity arises to apply cupping because of illness or custom, we do it at any hour at the beginning of a month, at its end, and in its middle, and at whatever time is required.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This occurs because there are men who, when blood multiplies within them, require its extraction by means of venesection; they find heaviness in their head and a stoppage.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them there are those who experience fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them there are those who experience itching on their face and forehead, darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them there are those who scratch the site of their venesection.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them there is one whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them there is one who experiences the taste of blood in their mouth or has an abscess on their tongue and spits out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them there is one whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them there is one who sees blood and redness, killings, injuries, and things similar to these in their sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see any of these things, and especially if it is on the thirteenth day of the month, we order venesection to be carried out after two or three hours have passed from that time.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The site of venesection on the nape of the neck is this: for it brings relief from heaviness in the head and that which flows towards the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it should be done after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And indeed this cupping is in place of the cephalic venesection.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	It is not permitted for those with a cold constitution or suffering from catarrh to use it.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it inflicts on him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And for this reason, it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, or those with cold illnesses in their head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	However, whoever is diligent about it has oblivion generated over him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for this reason you should instruct the Wind Doctor to place their hand briefly on the patient's lower body, fearing that oblivion may be generated.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	The Wind Cure or Alkehel is a substitute for the Black Phlebotomy and the Basilival Phlebotomy, and it benefits asthma, suffocative breathlessness, wheezing breathlessness, cough, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary to apply the Wind Cure or Alkehel briefly because if placed below this level, it produces weakness of the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The Wind Cure of Alhadjim is beneficial for sudden headaches, ophthalmia, migraine, and toothache pain at the roots; it is a substitute for the Basilival Phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you should instruct the Wind Doctor not to press their hand too hard with the scarification instrument, so as not to cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The Wind Cure applied under the chin benefits a dry mouth and corrupted gums, as well as other similar oral illnesses; it replaces the two-lipped phlebotomy of Aljeherich.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The Wind Cure of paddles benefits Alchafacha, which is an illness resulting from repulsion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The ventilation of the internal parts by means of two small tubes brings benefit comparable to that of venesection of three veins - Basilica, Fusca and Cephalica; for it draws blood from all those minute veins which are in the flesh; and these minute veins draw from other larger ones until this drawing reaches the three (major) veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And you should instruct the person carrying out the ventilation not to go too deep with the scarification; for the place is bared of flesh and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The ventilation cup which is placed on an aching part brings benefit to haemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And you should instruct the person carrying out ventilation to use a large cup and one made of copper; for the place needs strong suction, and perhaps fragile cups might break; and they must make an extensive scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Ventilation cups of the legs lessen markedly swellings; for they draw blood from all over the body and bring benefit to old pains in the kidneys, uterus and bladder; they provoke menstruation, and bring benefit to boils and itching; and serve as a substitute for venesection of two saphenous veins and the alcharoben.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However they greatly weaken the body, and cause many people to faint.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of ventilation cups for the alcharoben is nearly as great as that of ventilation cups on both legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The proper positioning of the ventilation cups is that you should put on a cup first when it is empty, and draw with moderate suction; and do not keep the cups in place too long but apply them quickly and remove them quickly so that humours arrive at an equal rate: and cease neither repeating this nor continuing until you see the spot turn red and swell up, and there appears some redness of blood; then scarify and repeat suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the arrangement of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	He who is of tender flesh among men, of whom there are few, should be sacrificed once, no more, so that the place may not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the Wind-Cutter to enlarge the incision and make it a little deeper, and moderate the suction in terms of ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then you should sacrifice him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first liquid, a way is opened to thin out the blood and reduce its wateriness; in the second, on the other hand, it is an expert inquiry into how to extract thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is very feculent, then a third sacrifice should be made so as to achieve the final goal.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually or little by little, one sacrifice is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish to extract much blood, we make multiple sacrifices.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to sacrifice with deep incisions; and the equal limit of incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is to be administered from the oils at the placement of the Wind-Cutters, and what must be cautioned by the Wind-Cutter.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In the case of one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places of Wind-Cutters be anointed with open, softening, dissolving oils: if it is in summertime, such as aloe oil, or violet oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from gourd seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is during winter time, then use narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or sarbatinum oil: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If however the superfluity is thick and cold, then use bitter lemon oil, or balm oil, or poplar oil, or dill oil: and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the windpipe is long with small pores and soft flesh, then it should be kept away from oil, and these people should wash the windy places of their bodies after a storm with dew-water, or with cold water, or with aloe vera water, or with gourd water, or with purslane water: and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is very moist should wash windy places with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach: and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	He whose superfluities are thick should wash his windy places with old wine, or with ivy water, or with dill decoction, or chamomile: and similar ones.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	One should be careful of getting windy in the bath or in the vapour of the bath; indeed one ought to administer it after coming out of the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And no-one should sleep after a storm.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is the thing by which one ought to be governed when windy or bleeding before a storm?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after this one ought to consider first of all: then if the windy or bleeding person is choleric, and excesses and inflammation conquer his blood; then it is necessary that he take refrigerants such as pomegranate molasses: also celery with vinegar and lettuce, and rocket (arugula), and dill: and similar ones.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And give him food like chicken, boiled lamb meat, and seasoned dishes with vinegar: and similar foods.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And for someone with a cold constitution, they should drink syrup made from honey or alum, or alsecaniabin made from seeds; and they should consume moderately aromatic wine, which is between old and new; and it is advised that they eat less food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	Give him chicken, lamb, small birds such as sparrows, and young pigeons to eat.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	On the day of ventouses and bloodletting, a person's drink should be greater than their food; and it is necessary to give some people almond tyriake or a medication made from musk (myrrh), or alesselithe before the application of ventouses: either before or after the bloodletting procedure; so as to strengthen the main limbs and purify the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	It is not advisable for them to drink it heated.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On ventouses without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Ventouses without scarification are those that are applied to the liver, spleen, for gout, and to the stomach, navel, kidney area, hip joints; because these limbs cannot bear the scarification process.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	They are not sought after except for the extraction of blood from one limb to another; like when we place a ventouse on the nipples during nosebleeds.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to relieve the cold congealed ventosity from one limb by applying it to another; like when we place a ventouse on the stomach and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	It does indeed thin out the limb, and it warms it up, and dislodges pain because it dissolves that viscosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys when there happens to be swelling or stones in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	By the virtue of its power of drawing, it perhaps opens up the swelling or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it does likewise when placed over the liver or spleen for dissolving the viscosity in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these leeches are administered empty with incision only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in pleurisy illnesses; it is such that the leech will be filled, and it will be large, with hot water alone or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of leeches administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Its opening be the width of two open fingers, as we made it; and its depth be half a palm's length; and there will be on its side in about its middle a small hole according to the size that a needle can go through; it is made of brass or bronze with smooth edges, thick, even, clean; so that it may not hurt the limb where it is placed over it; and let there be across its middle a transverse bar of brass or iron on which a candle with fire will sit.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this great leech is made, larger than we described above, and somewhat smaller than that one according to the illnesses and age of the person using it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	The windsickness in children and those with a frail constitution is different from that which affects men and those of robust physique.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of applying this windsickness with fire to the member is such that you light a wick with fire made of decent linen or a small candle made of wax; and place it on the middle of a transverse rod which is in the centre of the windsickness; so that the lit fire is approximately at the lower part of the windsickness, so as not to burn the body of the patient.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed on the member: and your finger should be over the hole I mentioned, until we hold the windsickness; when we need to, we remove our finger, and vapour will come out of that hole, and the windsickness will immediately heal.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the wick in its proper manner, and repeat this if you need to.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the windsickness which is administered for pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod and no hole; it is only administered because it is filled with water, and placed on the member alone.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger this windsickness is, the more it can hold lots of water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	On the suspension of leeches.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leeches are not administered in many cases unless it is impossible to position windsicknesses on the member because of its delicacy, as with the lip and gums, and things similar to these.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a member denuded of flesh, such as the finger or nose, and things similar to these.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is such that you must select leeches from those found in sweet waters, free from rot.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	They are then left for a day and night in sweet water until they become hungry and there remains nothing in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is emptied first with bloodletting and then with blistering.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then clean the member of the sick person until it becomes red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards place them on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are full and fall off, and it is possible to suck the place with a blister, then it is most complete in helping; but if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, rub it, and squeeze it out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	But if the course of blood is prolonged after the fall of the leeches and it is dripping; then immerse a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top until the drip stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood increases, then sprinkle over it powdered dry eggshell or gallnuts and things similar to them that have astringent properties; until the blood stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place on the spot half a peeled bean; and leave it until the beans stick to the spot for the blood has stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And if it is necessary to repeat leeches when possible, change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if the leeches are prevented from hanging on, then wipe the place with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Either fix the needle in place until some blood flows out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then apply [the poultice], for they themselves when they sense some blood, adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish for them to fall off, sprinkle over them some powder of ground aloe or salt or ashes: and they will drop off immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A general talk on restoring, dislocating, curing twisting, and similar [cases].
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter too is often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is about restoring fractures and dislocations that occur in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Sons, that fools among the doctors and laity boast about this chapter, and those who have never examined an old book, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is neglected among the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I myself never encountered any good in it at all, and did not achieve from it what I achieved except through the length of reading old books and my study to understand them, until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I clung to experiment and study throughout the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have described to you from it in this chapter all that my knowledge contains on the subject: and above what has passed by way of experiment with me, after having shortened it for you, and relieved it of the burden of prolixity, and abbreviated it by way of concise brevity, and shown it by way of decisive declaration: and I have depicted in it many figures of the forms of instruments that are employed in it, since it is a matter of supplementary statement, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	The sum and collections of bone fractures are from those which require explanation before we begin the review of broken limbs and their various parts, if any.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	We must say at the beginning of this chapter that we state in summary form and briefly the issues whose understanding is required first by a surgeon regarding any operation: namely to know or learn this noble skill for yourself as well as teach others. 
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say therefore that when a person has a fracture or dislocation or torsion or fall then you must go quickly to perform bloodletting and give laxatives, or both together if nothing prevents it such as weakness of constitution or the patient is either a child or a decrepit old man, or it's a time of extreme heat or severe cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Next you should restrict them to their diet, cold vegetables and the meat of birds or kids and forbid wine and coarse meats and allow filling foods and any food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are sure that the swelling has cooled and there is no fear of pus spreading to the limb then the patient can return to their normal diet with which they are accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the broken bone begins to heal then the patient should be fed nourishing foods with plenty of nutrients that are weighty and heavy with a degree of viscosity such as cooked wheat-based dishes in water or rice and heads and feet and stomachs of fowl and eggs and fresh fish and thick wine and similar.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	When this regimen is followed, fracture healing occurs faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	Also know that fractured bones, when they occur in men who are in their old age and decrepit, cannot always heal and consolidate according to their nature due to the desiccation of their members; instead, they heal and consolidate as if they were those of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature binds to the fractured bone from all sides a substance similar to glue that has some thickness and adheres to it and holds it together until they adhere to each other and bind with one another; until in time, strength and stability return as before, so that nothing hinders its function anymore. For this reason, it is necessary for you to provide the patient with nourishing food that has weight, viscosity, and thickness, such as we have mentioned.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	Also know that the types of fractures are diverse, depending on the different members of the body; for a leg fracture is different from one to the head bone, and a chest bone fracture differs from a back bone fracture, and likewise all other members differ from each other. And I have come with an exposition in its own chapter of every type of fracture set apart from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of bone fractures also differ within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because its fracture is curved, other than when pieces fall out of it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes its fracture occurs along the length of the bone; and there are stepped fractures within it, that is, pieces, and projections proceeding from them as in a reed when it is cut with a knife to write with.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	They do not proceed: it is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head; and it is a small crack fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And for every type of fracture there is a specific tool or instrument to repair it, as will be recalled later and explained at its proper place.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from what is known of bone fractures, there are its twisting and prominence; and their appearance to the sense and sound when you press them with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When, therefore, there is no apparent twist in place nor sound at your touch when you feel the bone with movement and the patient does not find great pain; then it's not a fracture but rather likely a twist or small crack: thus, one should not move it with hand and pressure but apply over it from medicines which will be recalled later, after some time appropriate to that place and then bind it with fine bandages.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the place is bent and split into two parts but without any other accident to it while all its parts are removed from their fellow; then you must begin your treatment of it from the start by equalizing it before a hot abscess occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	However, if an hot abscess occurs then leave it for several days until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to whatever way you can from its softness and nature.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its repair and equalization is easier than that of a bone with other accidents.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it according to what will be recalled to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from two parts, if it is a hand or foot; or with your own hand, if it is a small limb; or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb over an equal spot, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended: then try to bring back those additions with all skill, and in whatever way you can to their places; and beware, according to your strength, lest there happen upon the sick person due to your operation pain, or injury; and try, according to your strength, to fit together one of two bones with its fellow, according to the best shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour that you attempt to grasp and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something awry there, correct it, and equalize it according to the measure of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of violent stretching and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times they cause to happen through their operation a hot abscess or contraction in the limb, as we have often seen from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind up after the equalizing and proper operation, and the setting of that limb, and rest, and tranquility; and advise the sick person regarding it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him beware, lest he move it in the hour of his watches and sleep regarding its revolution and agitation and at excretion and all his movements with his utmost strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And he should take care that there is no position of the limb where pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Which is because when he feels pain or injury in a particular limb position, then it should be changed to another where there is no pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And you should advise him to ensure that his position is equal and straight so as not to cause any curvature when the limb is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture in the broken limb is as I describe it.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You should be aware that broken limbs vary according to their smallness or largeness, and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	So those that are small, like the arm, finger, toe, and similar, then a soft, fine linen bandage should be used.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But those that are large, like the thigh or leg, a wide, firm bandage should be used.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the wide bandage joins together a large limb and tightens its edges equally on all sides of the fracture so that nothing protrudes.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then you should start putting on the appropriate ointment after your cleaning from the centre outwards with soft lint over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to bandage over the place of fracture itself with three or four turns as is appropriate for the limb, and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with him to the upper part from where you bandaged the fracture site and tighten less than the first bandage.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then extend yourself with a roll from the fracture site for a while, and gradually loosen the structure until you grasp something substantial from the healthy spot.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another strip of cloth and roll it again over the broken spot with rolls.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	After that, go down with the roll to the lower part below the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your procedure be in the tightness of the roll and its loosening as we said for the first upper roll.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the rolls some soft linen or cloth to even out any curvature of the fracture if there is one; and if not, do not put anything into it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then roll another strip over the same spot.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	After that, arrange warm compresses on these rolls immediately if there is neither swelling nor a hot abscess at the site.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is swelling or an abscess, then place over it what sits on the abscess and removes the swelling; and leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind compresses tightly over them at that point.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the compresses be made of half-sized hollow reeds, scraped and shaped with skill; or they can be made of wood used for making sieves which are made from pine or gerahd i.e., palm branches, or calingi; each compress should have equal breadth, according to this shape and figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, the compress that is placed directly over the fracture should be slightly thicker and broader than the other compresses; and its length should match the limb according to its size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tighten it over the aster with another piece of thread, according to the same first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind it from above with off-centre threads, as we have said about binding: and [ensure] that your binding is over the site of fracture; the more you elongate [the wound] away from the fracture, make the binding tighter.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be of medium thickness and fineness, and they are to be made from soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the work of fools who use their own threads made from twisted linen cord, it is a great mistake; for the binding fails with them outside the realm of effectiveness.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine threads also are not suitable; for you will not achieve with them the binding that you wish to attain.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary for there to be less than a finger's breadth between the aster and the next one along.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the patient is injured by the ends of the asters after binding them to healthy sites; then place under them soft tow or crimson wool until nothing hurts from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with an overlying wound, and it happens that there is disruption of the skin, I will come to this in chapter two with particular reference to its uniqueness.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every broken limb must be bound with asters from the first day onwards.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	This is because when a limb is large, you need not place asters upon it unless after five or seven days, or more, according to your judgement about the hot abscess-like development.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	This is the way of making dressings by which the ancients restored those bones that are broken and dislocated.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	A method for making an abbreviated common plaster that restores broken bones and is suitable for many different constitutions but especially women and children since it does not succumb to heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	It is made from the flour dust of the mill and the flour dregs that cling to the walls of the mill near the motion of the millstone: and you mix it as it is, except that you sieve it with an egg white sieve: and lay its mixture neither thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then apply it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	A method of plaster that restores fractures, dislocations, and twists.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugwort; of all sucks take 10 oz., of myrrh and aloe each take 5 oz., and of althel take 20 oz.; grind everything together and sieve it and mix with althel water: or with egg white if the patient's constitution is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, quickly restores broken bones, and suits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	A method of plaster that also suits fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugwort, mess, and white lilies; of all take 10 oz., of myrrh and aloe each take 5 oz., acacia takes 6 oz., and Armenian bole takes 20 oz.; grind everything together with great care and sieve it and mix with water or egg white: and apply.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The method for applying a plaster to joints and bones separated from their places; it relieves the pain that occurs in them, [treats] bone dislocation and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Woolen cloth should be soaked in vinegar and boiled oil, then applied to the site.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	This plaster has no restorative properties but is good for soothing hot abscesses; it specifically alleviates pain.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Method of a plaster that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of the fig tree and wild poplar; grind them all together and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Method of applying an abbreviated plaster for the restoration of a bone fracture; when you want to resolve residual abscesses.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take one portion each of marshmallow root, chamomile, violets, and the herb plantain; grind them all together then mix with wine unless the limb is hot [inflamed].
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If the limb is hot [inflamed], mix it with moist coriander water or water instead and use as required.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method with a stronger plaster for resolving [hard abscesses] than the previous one, when an abscess develops during limb restoration.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take one portion each of marshmallow root, linseed, balsam, honey locust, water-plantain, violet flowers and chamomile; grind them all together then mix with willow water or fresh water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of this should be done according to the temperature of the limb and calming its heat [inflammation].
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything other than a poultice made of clay and oil should be placed on a broken limb during its restoration; he described it as being of moderate thickness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen considered that substances with drying and warming properties, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, along with similar substances from those we have mentioned, should be applied to a broken limb during its restoration.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Recipe for an ointment that relieves injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take equal parts of mugwort, chickpeas, human hair clippings or bird feathers, nettle, and salt; grind them up, sieve the mixture, and process it into an ointment.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The length of time for which a dressing should remain in place before being removed depends on considerations such as the absence of pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its position; if these do not occur, it may be left in place for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If the patient experiences severe itching, disturbing pain or swelling at the site of the dressing, it should be removed immediately; take a soft cloth or a moistened marine sponge and soak it in warm water to gently wash the area until the itching subsides and any pain is soothed.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	After that, allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then apply a piece of woollen felt soaked in vinegar and oil or rosewater over the limb and bandage it there for one night until you are assured that the heat blister has subsided, any swelling of the limb is quieted and its pain has been relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat this on a fine structure, and apply a small plaster; do not tighten it with your first compression, and keep the fine bandages with it until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all other symptoms have now completely disappeared, and you need a plaster and bandage, then repeat this process as you did initially.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of the things we have mentioned happen to the limb, then do not remove it unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when you remove it after twenty days, depending on how the limb appears upon its release, as we have mentioned, until the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh approaches over it: then also add in a bandage greater than your first compression altogether; also add to the enlargement of the patient's diet, according to what has been previously recalled.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	However, if you see that the place of fracture is already becoming dried out and more weakened than it should be, then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore immerse it with warm water at every release you make of it, and let this occur over the course of three days; also ease off on the bandage somewhat.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this process therefore nourishment reaches the limb and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which unskilled surgeons do when restoring a broken limb with another bone instead of the original one, because it is not restored properly at first and then has to be restored crookedly: this error arises from their procedure, and causes great fear; and if it had been correct they would have said so in ancient texts, and acted upon that.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen any traces of them there at all, and it is better that it should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Regarding the treatment of head injuries:
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	Types of fractures vary widely, with many different shapes and forms, and they have diverse causes.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	One type of fracture occurs due to a strike with a sword; the strike removes the entire bone up until it reaches the marrow beneath the bone, similar to how an axe splits wood; hence this particular kind of fracture is known as axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword cuts into a bone and grazes its surface without penetrating all the way through; this kind of fracture is called *kala'an*, or absolute levation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is an injury with two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	There is another kind of fracture that involves crushing or grinding; this occurs due to a strike with a stone, a fall onto one, or similar incidents.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	This fracture can also be penetrating, approaching the marrow beneath the bone; or it can occur on the surface of the bone itself. It is likewise an injury with two fractures that are either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	There is yet another type of fracture that is hidden within the bone itself, as thin as a hair; it is a small split and thus named *capillaris*.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	Another fracture occurs from a fall or strike with a stone and similar incidents that cause a piece of bone to enter the body cavity; it creates a hollow space there, like what happens in bellows when they receive a blow, allowing some air to pass into their insides.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And it happens most frequently in the heads of moist bones, such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fractures occur separately, and I will come with a recollection of that whole thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures by examination upon them and investigation with probes, as well as removal of the corrupted flesh that is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The capillary type is recognized by this: that which is detected over the bone and wiped away and lined above it with cauterization; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	However, in treating a fracture, consider first the patient's condition: then if you see from their conditions that they indicate clearly by vomiting of bile and fainting, as well as prostration, loss of speech, syncope, acute fever, giddiness, flushing of the face, and similar symptoms in many situations, certainly it will not heal; and if you see non-frightening conditions, and hope for recovery: then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if the wounded comes to you when first wounded: and it occurs during the winter days, then you must aim at removing bone before the fourteenth day according to every situation.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is during the summer days, then you must hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is beneath the bone from the flesh decays and those symptoms that we described occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the bone fracture has already reached the membrane touching the brain and is with shreds and stripping: then you must cut away the comminuted and stripped-away part as I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is necessary that you shave the head of the wounded person; and expose over the bone according to whatever manner is possible for you; and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light on the sick one.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it should happen to you during the exposure of bone that there is a flow of blood or a hot abscess: then oppose it with what is appropriate.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil; and let the wound rest until the abscess settles down, and be assured of no more flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the cure of bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is that you cut the bone with an Incisory of a sharp iron: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another Incisory, after the narrower one, somewhat wider: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then apply yet another Incisory that is even wider than the last one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	The second method is that you have a number of different Incisories with some being wider than others and some shorter than others; and they should be very sharp at their ends, and made from iron or steel: and strike gently on the Incisory so as not to shake the head and hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is hard and strong: then it is necessary that you drill around its edge before applying Incisories with Terebras which are called Non-deepening Drills; they are not so named unless because itself does not penetrate through the end of the bone to what is beyond it, since the Drill has a round tip on top of which is like an edge and small circle underneath prevents sinking in, and passing through the thickness of bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	You should take many of these drills from those bone chisels, each suitable for the thickness of a bone, until you have a drill for every part of the skull; the length and width of the pointed end of which corresponds to the thickness of that part of the skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	These are three forms of drills or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The technique of drilling around the circumference of a broken bone is to place the drill on top of the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another place and put in between any hole the thickness of a finger or about that much.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with knives what is between any hole in the bone and make it as thin as you can at that end of lightness, as we have said, until you scrape out the bone, either by hand or with some other tool which you prepared for that purpose such as forceps and fine scissors.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And you must take every precaution that the drill or knife does not touch any of this soft matter.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have therefore drilled around the bone and separated it from that soft matter, if they are still joined together then you must cut and scrape equally the end of what remains in the bone with another similar knife-like instrument.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However it must be thinner and finer than the other knives.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remains any small pieces of bone and gristle then take them out carefully with the tool you have at hand for that purpose.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound afterwards with dressings and ointments as we have described.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	Another method of operation is easy, completely removed from fear: which Galen said and praised it with great praise: and these are his words.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first of all to begin to expose the bone in that place where the fracture is more violent and apparent: until when you have exposed this part and placed under it one end of this Lenticular Knife whose form is thus.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the Lenticular part which is blunt does not cut anything: and its sharp part on both of its sides tapering to a point as you can see: so that the lenticular part may be applied against the bone with its cutting edge acute towards the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike upon the Knife from one side with a small mallet until you have cut through the entire bone as it turns: and be sure to stand clear of the knife so that no accident happens there which you greatly fear.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not a more ignorant and stupid person he would not be asleep now: then if any portion of this membrane still remains attached to the bone in certain places he should cut it away from that with one end of the same lenticular knife and free it from there easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is freed from this without injury and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not extend through to the membrane and that which is torn away from the bone is its surface while roughnesses and fine ridges remain in it: then you must scrape off this roughness and remove those ridges with very delicate scrapers from which you have prepared a number of different sizes so as to be able to apply from these those most convenient and suitable for each place according as your operation leads you and the fractured bone itself and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	You must sharpen your blade more than those of the other razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Next, use the finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not stop doing this until you reach the stage of sharpening the thinnest and finest of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	However, for each of the other small hairline fractures and fine breaks, you must take care to sharpen according to what leads to their correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And this is something that cannot be hidden from anyone who has any interest in this art, and they will have stood over what we have written and shown regarding large breaks.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if a piece of membrane is found and retained when you remove the bone: then you must take a piece of linen cloth according to the size of the wound, immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Next, take another piece of cloth, doubled or trebled, immerse it in wine and rose oil, place it over the first piece of cloth, and make sure you do this as easily as possible so that it does not rub against the wound.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply over this a wide bandage and do not tighten it unless the amount is such that it just holds the wound together; leave this for one day or two until you are sure the hot inflammation has gone.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Next, remove this bandage and apply afterwards medicines that are appropriate for excessive dryness such as lilies roots, herb flour, incense powder, aristolochia, and similar things; and it is best to make a powder of these medicines which you can sprinkle over the wound like a dry dusting.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And generally administer to it all medicine that has the property of cleansing and not stinging.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And ensure that according to your virtue, the wound is clear during its treatment; there should be no grease stains or dirt.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor should you allow any pus to accumulate on it; for when pus accumulates over the brain's membrane, it corrupts and putrefies it, and a great malice befalls the patient after that; this has already happened in the case of head syphilis, where the bone is cleansed by it, especially if its treatment is neglected, then blackness occurs on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider that if the patient experiences any of the conditions we have mentioned, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur unless it is caused by the medicine that is applied to it and if it is in the virtue of that medicine to cause such blackness, then you must take one part honey, three parts rose oil, and line them with a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then apply it to the syphilitic sores; afterwards treat it with curative spices that are suitable until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	The chapter heading "On the restoration of a broken nose" is not in sentence format, therefore I am unable to translate it into English. Please note that my instructions state that I will only translate complete sentences from Medieval Latin to English.
Caput IIII.	The Roman numeral "IV" is not in sentence format, therefore I am unable to translate it into English. Please note that my instructions state that I will only translate complete sentences from Medieval Latin to English.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You should know that only the two superior parts of the nose are broken at once or one of them; for it is composed of two bones: since its lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break and nothing happens to it other than abrasion, twisting, and indentations.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts is broken, then you must insert a small finger into the nostril hole, and with your index finger and thumb, realign that fracture until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this skillfully, with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, lest by your operation that pain upon the patient occur.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then you must use the end of a rod, one that is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If however the fracture is in both parts, then do likewise; and be quick to restore it on the first day of the break, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven or ten days when the swelling has cooled.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a linen thread if the break is in one part; or insert two threads if it is broken in both parts; and have the thread as thick as to fill the nostril hole.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said to immerse the threads in butter, changing them every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That however does not seem right to me; instead the thread should be soaked in the white of an egg, mixed with mill dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the thread until the bone hardens and the cartilage strengthens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of the thread, after it is wrapped in soft cloth; this holds the broken nose more firmly so that the patient can still breathe.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	This thing is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that; and if you wish, do Licinius's work.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If it happens that, while operating on a hot swelling, the nose of Naso becomes inflamed again, apply to his nostrils either a mustard plaster or a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil, or daiquiri.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If the inflammation does not occur then it is necessary that you apply plasters made with sesame flour and powdered incense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Next put a soft dressing on top of that; and do not bandage his nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	However if Naso's bones are broken or shattered by a small fracture then you must cut open above the break and extract those bits with suitable instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew the wound shut; and care for it with whatever promotes healing and consolidation of the flesh such as suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If ever there is an injury between the nostrils then you must treat it with strips of linen; and insert a lead pipe until healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On restoring the lower jaw when it is shattered:
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is shattered and there are no other injuries; then if its fracture is external only and not split into two parts, then identifying it should be straightforward.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	If the fracture is on the right side then insert your left index finger into the injured person's jaw; likewise if it is their left jaw that is fractured then use the index finger of your right hand instead: and with your other hand push inwards from behind towards the outside at the swelling of the fracture, pushing gently until you feel the bones meet.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two pieces, you must perform an extension from both sides according to its straightness until it can be equated.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If there is already damage to the teeth or they have been displaced, then fasten those you hope will remain with gold wire, silver, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place pulp on the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a doubled cloth over it, and on the cloth put a large unevenly shaped tile or a piece of leather equal in length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above according to how you have prepared the bandage for him and its application is suitable until the jaw is no longer broken; advise the patient of calmness and rest; and give him soft, easy-to-swallow food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If you think the shape has changed to some extent, then be quick and remove it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct that which has been changed and make a plaster with flour of barley mixed with egg white or sesame seed flour after you have removed the pulp; and place on the plaster some soft wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that plaster remains attached to it without changing the position of the bone, leave it in place and do not remove it until healed or until the fracture is secure.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If there is a warm abscess in the meantime, then apply that which we have said many times for its reduction until it is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if there's a fracture with a wound, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Now when the piece of bone has been separated from the limb, either by sawing or cutting; then you must make use of the appropriate fine instruments to remove those pieces of sawdust which suit your purpose for their removal.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If however the wound opening is tight, then widen it with a lancet according to the extent of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed the sawdust and none remains of it, sew up the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on top of it a plaster that suits this purpose, and apply flesh to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On restoring the fork when broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The fork is indeed most often broken on the anterior part of the arm; and its fracture occurs according to one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For it is broken either into two pieces without any sawdust getting caught in it; and thus its restoration is easier.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or that sawdust gets caught up within the bone; and its restoration is difficult.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or that there's a fracture with an open wound alongside it.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	When a fork is fractured without an open wound, the procedure is as follows: you must have two assistants; one of them holds the broken fork while the other extends their arm towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then align the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct and even; and there should be neither prominence nor hollows.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then you should place underneath the patient's heel a pad made of cloth or wool; its size should be according to your needs; extend and raise the fork, and shorten the pad with your hand until the fracture is reduced as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the end of the fork outwards because it has come out too deep, then the patient should be made to lie face down over his own neck; place under his shoulder a pillow of medium size and have an assistant press his shoulder downwards until the bone of the fork that is buried deeply is raised up; then reduce the fracture and align it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel slippage of the fork and it is moving, then you should cut open above it and remove that displaced part with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained by the bone, then introduce into its incision one of the knives you have prepared for this purpose; after you place under the fork a protector, and the protector is either wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon that has no hollow.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	Its width should be according to the size of bone you need it for and its fragility.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length should also be according to what is possible for you in the procedure.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	It should have two ends as you see it: one end is wide, the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If however the wound you opened when removing that displaced part of the bone is large and you are afraid of abscess because it is warm, then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the rupture is small or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and plugs according to the size of the injury's tear.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top of the abscess.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	However, if there is a bone fracture without any wound or break, you should apply a plaster made from flour and egg white to the bone.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place soft rags on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a ball under their armpit if they need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Next take a hemmeter, which is the wheel that the Saracens use and which is very long; its width should be one palm or around that size.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled plug on top of the rags and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Next take a thin board whose width is three fingers wide and its length likewise.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the board in it around the place of the hemmeter which lies over the fracture and site.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the hemmeter over the fracture as it was rolled up and wrap it around their neck, under their healthy armpit, and then under their injured armpit; bring it back to cover all parts where you see that the bone has been misaligned. It should not be concealed from view above and should cover everything so that the board is not removed from over the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, you should look after the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever you see the bone already starting to move away; then straighten it out and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's pillow under his back and put another small pillow at night under their head to elevate it on that side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Raise the fracture of the forearm by raising up the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind the patient's arm to their neck and do not release this bandage unless there is an accident at that site due to itching or from a sore until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see its surface has become exposed.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the bandage and leave it until it is healed and hardened.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	The fracture of the forearm is most often bound up and strengthened within twenty-eight days, sometimes sooner for some patients.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	### On healing a Fracture of the Jawbone.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The jaw is rarely broken except over its widest part; but if it does break then only the edge of it breaks off.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When the jaw is broken at this site and breaks right through its middle so that it cannot be seen from outside; then according to where exactly the break lies, you must try to set it in place.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And restore its shape as much as your ingenuity allows you to do so.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place over the wound powder from a mill with egg white, and soft lint, and cover it all with a little pad made of doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place over it a flat splint made of thin wood according to the size of the whole spatula, or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If there is any hollow under the splint in one of the spatula's places, then fill that hollow evenly with soft lint until the splint sits level.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind it tightly from above with a long bandage of the proper tightness and firmness to hold the splint in place until it does not move.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And check the binding every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the binding becomes soft, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it has moved from its place; also have the patient lie on their healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	The splint will heal within twenty or twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When that number of days is complete, then you may remove the binding; and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is made of bones whose fracture or dislocation need not be feared.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however, a piece of bone projects from it and pierces the skin, then split it open over that spot and remove the projecting piece.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we said with the fracture of the collarbone for a warm poultice from an aposteme if something similar happens.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On restoring fractures of the ribs.
Caput VIII.	Chapter Eight.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its limbs indeed break and shatter the most from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle breaks, which slopes downwards to the lower parts, and it suffers severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and a cough; perhaps vomiting blood, with concavity evident on the broken bone, and not hidden from perception, its restoration is for the patient to lie on their back with a pillow placed between their shoulder blades.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press their shoulders and bring the ribs together from both sides with your hands; and carefully align it as evenly as possible and appropriate until the shape of the bone returns as it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and a poultice on them, and put above it a star made of thin wooden board from willow or hazel, and similarly light ones, after you wrap it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then carefully bind it above the broken bone so that it is not moved; and go around with the binding according to the roundness towards the back several times, tightening it with a suitable bandage.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then check the bandage every hour and whenever it loosens, tighten it; and if its need provokes its removal due to itching, or corrosion which occurs in that place, or pain, or abscess: then hurry, and remove it, take off the plaster, and address what happens with an appropriate treatment method.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then bring back the plaster if you see its face; and attach to it a bandage until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	The restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that a rib fracture does not occur except in the thick parts which follow the back and at their ends from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not suffer dislocation because of this, since they are made of cartilage.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	Recognition of it is not hidden from the sense of touch during examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in this way: equally align the fracture with your fingers as best you can until the shape is equalised as it should be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Next apply plastering, and bind the broken bone with a splint if it needs one.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the rib fracture is towards the inside of the body, then the patient experiences severe pain and piercing, like that which occurs in pleurisy, because the bone pierces the lung, and they also experience difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting a lot of blood: and this condition is difficult to treat.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	Ancient physicians have devised many techniques for this condition, and among them are those who say that you should feed the patient foods which cause inflammation and wind, so as to inflame the abdomen and push it outwards, thus forcing the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We however refrain from doing anything which might cause a quick-forming hot abscess if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already occurred, then an addition is made to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	Some of them said to put something windy on the place, then suck it with strength, and this is more similar to logic.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, there is a fear that it may draw superfluous humors to the site due to its weakness-inducing properties.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the site should be covered with wool already soaked in warm oil; and let wads be placed between the ribs until full, so as to have an equal binding when you wrap it around according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the patient should be treated with treatment for pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the illness afflicts the patient severely in a way that is not tolerated and the wound stings with a harmful jab, and we fear for the patient; then it is necessary to cut open above the site, and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we should place above it the instrument that preserves healing, whose description preceded; and cut the rib with ease, and also cut said instrument.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we should bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with stitches; and we should treat it with plaster until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If meanwhile a hot abscess occurs, then hurry and insert wads into rose oil, and place it on the site; and let the patient be treated with what is appropriate for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile they should lie on their side of the wound until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of spinal fractures in the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	The bones of the neck sometimes suffer fracture, and rarely do they undergo attrition; similarly with spinal vertebrae in the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When it happens to someone and you want to know whether they will be healed or not, then consider the following...
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	If you see their hand already softened and numb, lifeless; they cannot move it or stretch it out nor clench it, and when you squeeze it with your fingers and prick it with a needle they feel nothing and experience no pain: then know that this person will not heal, and in most cases this is fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if they can move it and feel the squeeze of your fingers and the prick of a needle then know that the bone's neck is still intact and this patient will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If it happens in the vertebrae of their back and you want to know if they will heal or not then consider their feet; if they are also soft and lifeless like their hands were, then when this person is lying on their back air escapes them without control, and when they are on their stomach waste comes out without control: when they turn onto their back again they cannot urinate although wanting to: know that this is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore do not trouble yourself with treating them.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If none of these things happen to this person then the case is less severe.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	To treat this patient you should try to reduce the hot abscess's inflammation by putting rose oil alone on a rag over the affected vertebra or with roast lamb entrails.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Do this several times a day until the hot abscess is reduced; then put one of the tightening, drying plasters on it and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest and keep calm.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He must not sleep on top of the side where he finds pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If this happens when there is erosion of the bone or something which has already come away from it: then one must cut above the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then draw together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some red ointment until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	But if the last bone of the leg is broken and it's the end of the tailbone: then one must put their left thumb into the anus, and with the other hand equalise the broken bone as far as possible according to what alignment you achieve.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place something over it and remove it; and treat the wound with whatever treatment came before until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the restoration of the hymen.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	It's rare for the bones of the hymen to break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they do break then the break is not a fracture but an erosion at their ends; and they split lengthwise and curve into the inside; and it happens that there's pain for the sick person in that place and a pricking, and the leg which was broken goes limp.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	Its restoration is to spread your hand over it until you feel above the break like its shape suggests.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	But if the break is only at its ends then equalise that break according to what alignment you achieve until it's like its natural shape again.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If the fracture is along its length or has already shifted inward, then have the patient lie on their stomach until you prepare to set that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have therefore leveled it, place a plaster cast on top of it; then put on top of that a splint made out of wood or leather, and tighten the bandages over which you fear neither any change in the fracture nor displacement of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize their concavity with that which fills it up until the bandages grasp it according to evenness; and instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if a hot abscess should occur, then desist from extending it and setting it until the hot abscess subsides; then put on top of that which has subsided just as before, then return to its setting; and tighten it as you ought.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if an arrowhead has penetrated the bone or shattered it, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the setting of fractures in the arm.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The splint is that which lies between the elbow and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it breaks therefore, then its setting is according to one of two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take flat wood of medium thickness in this shape, as follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And bandages will be tied at the two ends with two bandages.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it will hang from an elevated place; and the patient shall sit on a chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	He should then throw his broken arm over a wooden support until he reaches the armpit, where there will be an attached curved piece of wood in the middle.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above it to stretch the assistant downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor should grasp the fracture with both hands at once until it returns to its original state as it ought to be.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is for the patient to lie on their back with their neck; then hang their arm from their own neck using a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants to hold it; one above the fracture with his hands and another below it, each stretching in their own direction.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for a stronger stretch then tighten below the fracture with one ligament and above it with another; let each of the two assistants stretch in their own direction.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is close to the shoulder joint then a ligament should be placed under the armpit and another beneath the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is close to the elbow then a ligament should be placed on that spot and over the actual elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then adjust the fracture easily without difficulty until it is aligned as it ought to be and heals well; then tighten it if no hot inflammation occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if hot inflammation does occur then release the tight bandage until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place over it a dressing of wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the inflammation quiets; then tighten it again with an ointment on the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a bandage made from new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then bring the arm alongside for support, and place their open hand over their shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	Place a cloth and bind it tightly over the supporting arm, so that the arm stays in place as splints: if nothing prevents you from doing this, nor will anything shift within your broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something might shift within your broken bone, then use splints: and it is best to place over the fracture itself a splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between the width of all splints a finger's breadth: and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, with an additional three finger-breadths on each side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind tightly over the splints using the method I described at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is important that your binding be tighter over the site of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more extended the fracture is, the less tight should your binding be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see that the placement of the splints and binding is as we have described, then do this when restoring the limb immediately: and if you fear a hot abscess, then loosen the binding and remove the splints until the seventh day, as I said before.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then check the binding on all three days, so that an itching or swelling does not occur at the site, nor is food prevented from reaching the limb due to excess binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct it all according as I have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If, however, it is not certain that something will happen, then do not remove the ligature until after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And if the patient is sleeping on his back with his hands over his stomach, place under the support cushion full of wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider every hour of the night or day to ensure that the position of the broken limb is not altered nor the ligature loosened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore, correct all this with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give the patient food according to the order we mentioned earlier; let the first foods be soft until his jaw begins to tighten, and then you must thicken his diet.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is the custom that a splint and crutch should be worn for forty days; at this point, it must be removed, he should have a bath, and be anointed with ointments that straighten the limb.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	But if the fracture is foul and crushed, do not remove from it the splint and wooden wedges until fifty days or even two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of the broken limb of the arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is made up of two bones which are called the forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of these is small, being the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	The other is large; it lies beneath the smaller bone below.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps only the larger forearm bone is broken, or perhaps the smaller one, or maybe they are both broken together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the lower jaw is broken in a minor fracture, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower jaw is broken in a major fracture, its injury is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it gets worse when two bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is the lower jaw in a minor fracture, then it behooves the physician to attend to its restoration by applying gentle traction until it is even.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however it is the large lower jaw that has been broken, then he must apply a very strong traction to restore its position.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And he must place the palm of his hand in position for its restoration, with an extended stretch above the pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of his hand be higher than all the fingers; and let it act as a joint to all the other fingers, or at least some of them: and let the sick person sit square before himself, with the pillow in front of him, or directly beneath him, at such a height that he incurs no effort.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the attendant must extend the arm from below with either his hand or a cord.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another attendant must likewise stretch it from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should level the bone until he reduces its position to as good a figure as possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there is bending to the bone fracture, then strive to bring every piece back into its place by your might.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If however you find the dislocation to be separated and it punctures through the skin, with no hope of restoration for you, then bind it up, and remove it according to what we have described above.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If there is a fracture with a wound, I have already done that in a separate chapter, so take the cure from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If at the beginning of your restoration a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth with a cerate made of rose oil, and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth onto it with a tight bandage until the abscess subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared with flour of millstones and egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then apply splints, and let the splint that is placed over the fracture itself be a little wider, and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases: whether there be a fracture in one shaft or two shafts together.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then apply your bandage over the fracture site more tightly and forcefully, and somewhat tighter again with the bandage above or below the fracture: or apply a softer bandage to it slightly looser than its tightness as mentioned at the start of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that wrap around the fracture be soft and moist: and not hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is bound be linen, and medium between thin and thick, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and its ligaments after a day.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If there is something that requires correction, such as itching of the limb: then you must embrocate the limb with warm water until the itching subsides, and release the limb from its bandage until it calms down, then repeat the binding.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the tightness has already softened and the bone is removed, and similar matters to these: then straighten it all with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness, then you must soften it somewhat and leave it for a few days until the nourishment reaches it, afterwards tighten it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If none of the things we have mentioned happen to the patient, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days or thereabouts.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the patient's hand should be hung from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be straight, and it should be kept steady by his skill to avoid violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	Make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture heals within thirty days or thirty-two days and perhaps it is healed after twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this is according to the dispositions of one's constitution and their skill.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the healing of broken bones in the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that broken bones rarely happen in the knuckles of the hand or at the joints of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	It does not happen to it unless there is repeated attrition (i.e., rubbing together).
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	So when there is a fracture or attrition of the heel bone (i.e., calcaneus), then the patient should sit square and opposite him/her should be placed an equal seat.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on it, extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant should extend the broken bones, and the doctor should align them until they join with a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	At this point, it is necessary to apply the plaster cast and bandage, unless a hot abscess occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Place the splint over it according to the size of the area, you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	However, if the fracture is in the lower part of the foot near the sole, then make a ball out of cloth and ask the patient to press his broken foot against it; afterwards it should be secured with a long piece of linen.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	The splint should be made of soft leather so that it conforms to the shape of the foot; tighten it as required.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is on the outside, you should place a splint over it and another underneath at the sole of the foot; make sure that the hand is extended and open.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place bandages as you would for a hand injury; extend the binding between the toes.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If any of the toe joints is broken, if it is the big toe then align as required.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Afterwards it should be secured with the foot; if necessary, apply a straight splint to prevent any elevation of the fracture and ensure that there is no movement.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the other toes are broken (such as the middle, index, little or ring toes), then they should be aligned and bound to the next healthy toe; alternatively all of them can be bound together which is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Place a small asterisk on it as we mentioned before, on the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	Consider the restoration process and following your arrangement of the warm poultice: address any complications that arise as described in his account.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the restoration of hip fractures.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone often breaks and is easily detected because it twists towards the inner and back part of the body.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	To restore this injury, bind a bandage above the fracture and another beneath it.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	Let the patient lie prostrate on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	The assistant then stretches every bandage to its limit on each side evenly if the break is through the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	However, if the break is near the hip bone's root, a bandage should be placed at the ilium so that its stretch goes upwards and another beneath the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	Similarly, if it is close to the knee, place the bandage near the knee so its stretch goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	The doctor should then align the bone ends with his hands until it returns to its original shape and join them in a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Apply a plaster cast and bandages if no infection develops in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If an infection develops there, you should leave it for a few days until the warm swelling subsides before returning to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	Its stricture should be such.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	You must roll up the bandage over the fracture of the dura mater; that is, you should double it twice or three times, and there should be a remainder from its surplus.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then roll up the leg until you reach the heel at the root of the buttock.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the thigh and leg near the knee to the underside, and let the ends of the thread come out from the upper part of both parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll up over the leg and thigh what remains from the other bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place over the thigh at the site of its fracture some splints, and put one splint above the leg bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the gaps between the leg and thigh with soft cloths until you equalize the tightness.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then start with a strong bandaging from the middle over the site of fracture by three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you extend with the bandage from the site of fracture, let your binding be tighter and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then reach the two ends of the thread that you introduced between the thigh and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie with both [ends] three splints which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with both ends of the thread to the underside until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both, bind also the ends of the splints from the other side so that the bandage is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Release the constriction over it while it remains, so that there is no corrosion of the limb, nor abscesses, nor inflammation, and similar things to them.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything should happen as a result of this.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Wash it with its remedy and correct whatever happens as a result entirely, just as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if there is a splinter of bone from the bone that is protruding: then you must cut it out equally, as much as you can.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, place something over it, and remove it; and treat the person whose symptoms have occurred before, until they are cured.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is compressed, besides which splints are added to it, as we have said about the arm and shoulder.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, when this fracture is restored, there is no limp in the patient.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, apart from the fact that another leg is applied to it, then there must always be a limp in the person whose it is.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is compressed within fifty days, or a little more, or less; all of this is according to variations in constitutions and other conditions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	### On the restoration of the fracture of the knee cap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the knee cap rarely experiences fracture but is subject to wear many times.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If it does experience fracture, then there is no other than either a crack or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it happens with a wound and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And he stands over it whole with his senses.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that what has been broken of its parts will be levelled with fingers until it is united and joined as well as possible by levelling and smoothing, and shaping.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster of sesame flour or mill flour with egg white: and put over it a round wooden board, if you need one: and press down upon it with a binding suitable for that purpose.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the treatments we described for other fractures: such as hot inflammation and similar conditions; so that you apply to every incident whatever is suitable for it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	§ On restoring the fracture of a leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that there are two leg bones, one of which is thick and named the shin bone; and another fine one, called the calf bone.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both of them by type as what happens to the two bones of the arm; and because of this its restoration is equal to that of an arm, and the operation is one and the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones break at once, the leg turns into all pieces.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the finer bone breaks, the leg turns forward.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone breaks you will find it lower down; and it is one of those that are not hidden from view.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, equality and binding of the stars equally according to that.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the leg fracture is a severe one, with many ligaments involved, your extension should be smaller and gentler.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg there is something from the operation over the arm, and it is such that when you equalize the stars and complete all your work, then take two pinewood splints used to make roof tiles placed under the rafters; choose those which are neither too thick nor too thin, and let their length be according to the leg's length from knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap each splint with two layers of bandage according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side and the other part on the opposite; let them be from knee down to foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two splints together at three places: both ends, and midway.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For with the binding in place the leg sags to both sides and maintains good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	Now let there be made a cradle of wood according to the leg's length; place the leg in it so that it may keep itself from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	Indeed one must make sure to do this for the fracture when there is an open wound as well.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then check the leg every day, and pay close attention to any infection, inflammation or other complications.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If any of these occur, then treat it with what is needed until the leg heals, God willing.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On fractures of the bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel bone is not fractured at all.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot sometimes become fractured, and also there is a slight fracture of the toes; but they are never broken except by attrition in various places.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	But if the bones of the foot are fractured and you see these bones raised one above the other then let the patient put his/her foot on a prepared piece of ground as when walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand yourself and place your foot on that which is raised up from these bones; afterwards press it, or stamp on it; and equalise them until they return to their places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place on it a plaster cast and some cloth above that; then place under the sole of the foot a small board with two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it together with appropriate bandages after you have wrapped it up with cloths and other things as required.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed then untie the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find that the bones have become level if they were broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	So therefore there is treatment for them as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if some of the toes are broken then restore them and equalise them as I have described to you for restoration of the fingers of a hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a splint alongside the toe according to its length and let it be slightly wider than that; then put under this foot the board which I described to you before and bind them with appropriate bandages.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If the bone that is broken consists of two pieces or three or more, then place a splint of appropriate size over each finger wrapped in linen cloth, and bandage it to a board underneath the foot; let one end of the board extend beyond the stomach of the foot so as to hold [the splints] firmly.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is necessary for you not to forget that you should consider all the things I have said about other types of fractures from the accidents we mentioned; and apply them as appropriate in each case.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Regarding the fracture of a woman's collarbone and a man's ribcage...
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's collarbone is broken, make her sit on a square-shaped seat.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then tilt her slightly towards the side of her back; let someone hold her from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	The midwife should then fill her collarbone with cotton wool until it is completely full; the collarbone will become like a sphere as a result.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	The woman should then be shaken slightly; her back must be raised gradually afterwards.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	The cotton wool will emerge from this side until it becomes a sphere in front of the collarbone; the broken bone will be rejoined as a result.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a little pillow on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she wants to urinate, the cotton wool should be removed gently; let her go to the toilet and then replace it as you first put it inside; afterwards, she can return to her pillow.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	She should do this for seven days or so; the bone will be restored in that time.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and bind over its opening a reed tube, and insert the entire bladder into his anus.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder inflates inside his rectum, for it will burst again.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with cottage cheese and let it remain there for several days, as we have described, until he is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of a man's or woman's pelvis breaks, then apply what we have described for the repair and equalization of the pubic bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the anus is not concealed by these nearby fractures which are of little consequence, especially to someone who has some interest or use for it.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this book of mine very well because the fracture itself shows you, in many cases, a straight path to repairing and tightening it: so understand it.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When a man's penis is broken, take the gullet of a goose: and insert the penis inside it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over it a wrap made of cloth, and it should be bandaged up and left for three days or thereabouts, and he will recover if God wills it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the repair of bone fractures when they are accompanied by wounds.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is appropriate for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large like the bone of the hip, or the supporting bones, or something similar to them, that you hasten and immediately have him bled by a phlebotomist; if he meets the conditions for bleeding as we described above.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound discharges blood, then you must promptly proceed to its excision, applying crushed zege powder onto it, if no other [powder] is available.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not postpone it unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if there is a hot abscess, then postpone the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess settles down.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third day or fourth day at all, because you would cause bad things to happen to it.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	However if the broken bone is protruding through the skin then it must be attempted to reduce it by aligning it with your hands gently and with minimal extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If however its extension is not prepared for, nor its alignment with your hands then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the instrument is made of iron with a length of seven or eight fingers and its width according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason it is necessary that the physician take three or four according to how many he needs of them for each type of fracture treatment.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it is round with a small thickness so as not to double up during compression on it at the time of operation and has sharp edges with bevelled ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And its upper half is thickened from the middle to its lower end.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation it is necessary that the curved sharp end be placed over the protruding bone and push with it in one motion until the bone returns to alignment.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Attempt to align the fracture's ends with each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its end is broken too finely and does not take the tool well, then you must cut down that bone's end until the tool has a good purchase on it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	But if you cannot reduce them with what we have described, then cut it open with one of the knives that suits it best, as we said before; or saw through it with any one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then smooth out what remains of roughnesses and small splinters from the bone.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone has been put back and the patient afterwards experiences severe pain, you know that it is not in its proper place again.
Fac ergo illud.	Do so, then.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you give the patient great relief when your restoration of the bone is complete.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse some cloth in black styptic wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not apply any sort of poultice to the wound nor anything oily; so that it does not cause rot and corruption there.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then give your patient aster leaves an hour after you have finished restoring the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound open; so as to cut an opening with scissors into the wrappings according to the size of the injury.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take every care not to bind up the wound tight around the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many times indeed have these foolish physicians done it: they caused to happen over their patients either death or decay, or suppuration, that is, pus.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And if your fracture is soft, gentle, different from other types of fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	But if the wound is bad or a large one, and you fear some of the complications we described might occur, and you find pain in the suspended site; then it should not be necessary to put weights on top.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them rolls of hard cloth at the place of the weights, and tighten it with these.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	However, after one or two days when you see the wound begin to generate pus; then take away from it the cloth which you placed on top with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply liniments and ointments with which we are accustomed to treating wounds: such as the four-ingredient ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	It is appropriate for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every morning and evening until it is healed and consolidated.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And the limb should be prepared in such a way that pus may flow easily from it downwards.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	But if many days pass by the wound and it does not consolidate nor is the pus separated from it; then you may know there are small splinters of bone within.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why you must probe the wound with a tent.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those small splinters have been removed, take them out and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those that are not separated from them and pierce the limb and cause pain, try to cut into them, and remove them in every way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If a wound occurs with an abscess or ulceration, that is, with a tumor, or some other sign of corruption and putrefaction: then you should apply to each one of them what corresponds to it regarding its treatment, the description of which has been narrated earlier in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from this, in what my speech should stand on, and to which you should direct your attention when a bone is broken and protrudes beyond the skin, like the bones of the hip, the arm or similar large members: it is that you must not presume its traction, for many times death occurs from it; rather leave it alone until it rots.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Indeed, perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore treat the wound if it seems appropriate to you; otherwise, leave it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of swelling in the track of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This swelling often occurs along the track of healing from a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially when it is close to the joints; and the shape of the limb is distorted by it.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, consider that if the swelling is recent, you should apply medicines with astringent properties to it, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, gum Arabic, acacia, and similar substances.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Take some or all of them; prepare them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and place them on the swelling wrapped in lint, securing them firmly with a good bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	Leave the bandage in place and do not remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it and apply another one, until the swelling is gone.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bandage over it a piece of lead foil.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of drawing out any noxious matter from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already turned to stone and is bound up, and there's a pressing need to remove it quickly: then make an opening above its upper part, and cut off any protruding mass; or scrape it with some scrapers until it is gone; and treat it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Now concerning treatment when the limb is restored but remains thin, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of bone is healed but the limb remains thin and weak: this happens for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One reason is an excess of the solution used for bandaging and tying it up not being as it should be; either through over-tightening of the bandage so that nourishment cannot reach the limb; or too much ointment applied at the wrong time; or because there's little blood in the patient's body, and weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	Treatment is to feed the patient nourishing food, and make his body soft so that the blood multiplies within him.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place a peg on the limb: so that it will draw pus towards itself in great quantities.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And frequently anoint him with warm water until the pus runs out and his limb returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On curing broken bones when they have healed crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a limb which has already healed after its cure of crookedness and projection of the broken bone or knotting, and is disfigured by it, but nevertheless the limb does not prevent from its natural movement: then you ought not to listen to him who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have already been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who did that in our country.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is truly blameworthy, leading to death or great fear so that the patient be terrified of dying.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knotting are recent, then it is necessary that he be anointed with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as althea leaves, and its root, and *mellilot*, and those like them.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make for him a plaster with softening plasters, such as *dyachylon* done decently.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucilage of althea root, and mix it with goose fat or sesame oil: and plaster him with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	They should take plump figs and mix them with pigeon dung and similar substances which are called among medical men bone-softening agents.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot unties itself with steady, ancient, gentle friction which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	One should move the limb to every side at all hours of the day.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the curvature has already advanced and become strong and turned into a stone-like hardness, and it is necessary to treat it with iron, then one should cut above it from the top and detach the connected bone, and cut away what is superfluous of the knot or bone with delicate Incisors; and ease in that be applied with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On dislocation (lit. 'joint-displacement').
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is the displacement of any joints from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it is prohibited from movement and defaces the figure of the limb.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pain and injuries to occur in the weak person.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore when it happens to someone that a dislocation has occurred, one should rush to restore it and not delay at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if the treatment is delayed, then the place becomes calloused and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	For this reason it should not be moved nor stretched at the time of its callousing.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes spasms and painful injuries to occur.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	Indeed, when that happens, one must hasten to perform a bloodletting on the patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then they should be discharged until the abscess subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Afterwards, the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then they should be discharged until the abscess subsides.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every limb should be treated with whatever comes to mind when recalled in its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, as well as those that came before regarding fractures, from the upper to the lower parts of the body.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment for dislocation of the mandible.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Two jaws rarely dislocate unless they do so to a slight degree.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Either they are removed slightly from their places, or they become somewhat softened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are completely dislocated until the parts soften towards the chest; when it reaches the patient's saliva and they cannot hold onto that or close their mouth, and their speech is wrapped up with their tongue.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	But when its dislocation is slight, it returns to place by itself in many positions with little trouble.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If however it is completely or fully dislocated: then one must hasten to its reduction and not delay at all; the minister should hold the patient's head and the physician insert the thumb of their hand into the root of the dislocated jaw between their teeth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	He should insert both his thumbs at once if the dislocation is from two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the rest of his fingers should be kept outside, with which he tests (it).
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And tell the patient to clean his jaws and thoroughly rinse them out for eating on all sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor should test (the jaw) and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If its repositioning is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved: then apply a hot fomentation with water and oil until the repositioning of both becomes easy; and do not delay the repositioning of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they therefore return and are tested, and the patient's mouth is closed, and there is no softening: then place over them pads of cloth with a cerate made of wax; and rose-scented oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it should be bound gently with soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the patient should sleep on his back; and his head should be made to rest between two pillows so that he cannot move it from side to side; nor should he attempt or be forced to chew anything: rather, his food should be given by gentle sucking until such time as the pains subside and the jaw is healed; then let him eat what he wishes and give it to him without difficulty.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let him not work on the task of opening his mouth at mealtimes and drinking, nor yawn, until the jaw is healed and restored to health.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	But if the repositioning of both jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and do not return to their places; then from this many fevers often occur with a continuous discharge, and perhaps the patient's stomach becomes relaxed, or perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see that, then know it is a lost cause, and many times the one afflicted dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of dislocations of the fork-bone and shoulder joint.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The fork-bone does not dislocate from the inner side due to its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it sometimes dislocates outwards, which is evident by the sense of touch.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is for the patient to lie on their back and stretch out their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then squeeze the area with your palm firmly, for it will return to its place.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	After that, apply a plaster and splints on top of it, and bind them tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities that follow the elbow, and which are connected to it, do not dislocate unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it has dislocated at any point in time, then it must be reduced and aligned as we have said, and as is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	After that, apply a plaster and splints on top of it, and apply tight bandaging.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the patient to adhere to rest and tranquility until they have healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the shoulder joint is reduced when it too has become separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the shoulder joint.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter Twenty-Seven
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You know that the humerus is dislocated only in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is that it is dislocated towards the side of the coracoid process on the lower side.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it is dislocated toward the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated towards the upper part of the humerus, which happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	It does not dislocate backwards because of the shoulder blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	It also cannot be dislocated forward due to nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	It indeed tends to be most often dislocated and exits towards the lower side of the coracoid process, especially in those whose flesh is sparse.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it exits quickly from them and also enters rapidly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is abundant, it happens contrary to that, namely because it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps there are some people who suffer a blow or fall and the humerus becomes swollen with a hot swelling, which is thought to be because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore it is necessary that you examine this until you are certain of its cause, and then proceed to treat it.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	A dislocation is recognized when it is towards the lower side of the coracoid process, and you must distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find an obvious difference between them and discover in the head of the dislocated humerus concavity, and under the coracoid process, near where the head of the humerus should be, as if it were an egg; and the sick person cannot lower their hand to their ear nor move it with all its motions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	Similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, then you will find a clear indication by touch, and it will not be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	The reduction of this particular dislocation is easily achieved when it is recent or the patient is a weak child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	The reduction method involves the assistant lifting their hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under their armpit and lift the joint with strength upwards to its original position; meanwhile, the assistant lifts their hand and stretches it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then lay them down; for they return quickly on their own.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	However, if it does not return as described and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred; then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in warm water and be given an embrocation that softens and soothes, such as when Althea roots, fenugreek, and meadowsweet are boiled in water and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient should lie on their back; and under their armpit should be placed a sphere of wool of equal parts softness and firmness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place their heel on top of the sphere and lift the patient's shoulder with strength while pulling their arm downward.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	Another assistant should hold the patient's head to prevent movement downwards; for it returns immediately on its own.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	If you wish, reduce it in this way; and that is for a taller man to be present who stands on the patient's side and inserts his shoulder under their armpit: then he should lift the patient's armpit upward until they are suspended in midair.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	The other assistant should pull the patient's hand toward the lower part of their abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If the patient is slight in build, then something else must be hung from them to weigh them down; for otherwise the dislocation will recur immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	It can also be done in another way: by fixing into the ground a long pole whose head is round like a pestle handle; this should not be either too thick or too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then the patient should be placed on top of soft cloths that have been laid out under them, with their body aligned along the length of the pole.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Next his hand should be pulled toward the lower part of his body from one side, while on the other his whole body should be extended with force; for in this way the joint quickly returns to its proper place.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If all the above-mentioned methods prove ineffective for reducing it, then try this treatment: take a pole whose length is equal to twice your forearm's length, its width equivalent to four fingers, and its thickness two fingers; this should have a rounded head like the one shown in the diagram below.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths should be wrapped around its rounded head to prevent it from injuring the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	After that the pole should be placed under the patient's dislocated joint so as to extend their hand or arm down onto it and thus reach its lower end; then tie the pole firmly in place, securing both the assisting hand/arm and the injured limb’s extremity.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the patient's arm should be placed along the width of one step in a ladder, their hand extending down to its lower edge; while on the other side their body remains suspended as before.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The junction enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	Therefore when its opening is complete in any possible way, you must place underneath the needle a woolen sphere of equal quantity.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Next place the prepared plaster made of flour powder with incense and egg white all over the shoulder like it rolls down from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind it underneath the needle with a suitable bandage, and roll its strap over the plaster from above; his hand is tied to his neck, and [the patient] is left without moving their hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	The patient's diet should be restricted until the limb regains strength, for this expedites its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then after seven or five days an elastic bandage should be put on, and movement exercises are performed.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If the limb is firm and not soft then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the joint is dislocated repeatedly due to moisture or for another reason then a three-hole caustic should be applied as described above regarding caustics.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done and the bandage removed after seven days but the joint isn't firm and plaster and bandages are reapplied several times without it becoming firm and falls again and cannot raise itself above then you know that its nerves near the head of the shoulder have been severed or stretched or softened, and you will know that the joint never be set in place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	As for a dislocation towards the chest and breast or one that is reduced to the back then it is done with an impulse and stretching using hands until it returns; then the rest of the bandage and treatment are applied until healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If, after recovery, there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use a bath frequently until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the cure for dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty too; it can be dislocated in all directions, but especially forward or backward.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation will not be hidden from you; for it falls under sight and touch, whichever way it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with a healthy one, it will be evident to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint will be bent, and it cannot bend its arm or touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must hurry and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess occurs in it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if an abscess occurs in it, its reduction will be difficult; and perhaps it may not heal at all, especially when it is at the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	It is worse than all other forms of dislocations and causes greater pain; and frequently death comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And when its restoration is possible among those that can be reduced, it should be done by extending the patient's hand with both hands; and their arm should be spread out, and the doctor's hands are above and below the elbow; and he pushes on the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or the dislocation is forward: then he returns so that he doubles up his hand with its own hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which has been dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a strong and violent extension: it is for two assistants to extend the arm; and let two assistants also hold it so that it cannot be moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is turned around to every part after a folded cloth or a wide bandage has been wrapped around his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should grease it with oil so that it is one of those things which assist in lubricating the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should push the joint with a strong thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction it must be placed over it a plaster which contains an astringent and a drying agent with egg white, and it should be bound with a suitable bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm is to be suspended from the patient's neck, and left there for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is released.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	So if the joint remains firmly in place then remove the bandage from it and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the joint is not properly bound then repeat the plaster and bandage, and leave it for several days until it binds.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however there is weight and stiffness after the reduction of the joint and it is fixed in movement: then apply moistening in bathing and gentle friction, and compression until it is eased or place over the joint fat from the rump, that is, rich lamb.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it should be bound and left in place for a day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Next remove the splint, and immerse it into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	Once it has sweated, then rub the affected area with tempered friction liniment.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat the process with an eased voice once, twice, thrice with immersion in a bath until it softens.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, apply cow dung that is moist, warmed with butter, and wrap it around the affected area.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it will soften and return to its natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	¶ On the treatment of dislocations by Al-Mahas.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The hand (which is connected to the arm by way of joint) often becomes dislocated.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And reducing its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike that of the other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However it is necessary that the speed of its reduction be done within the hour in which it was dislocated before swelling sets in; otherwise a hot abscess will occur.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And reducing the dislocation is done by placing the weak hand of Al-Mahas on a table and having an assistant extend their arm; and then the physician will place their palm over the joint's prominence and push it until it returns to its normal position.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	But it should be considered that if the palm has already receded towards the belly of the hand then place the weak person's back (of their) hand on the table for its extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding toward the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be internally on the table, i.e., the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table so that the physician's hand falls upon the prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing poultice to draw out the inflammation, and leave it be without further interference.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	If however it does not tolerate this and you are unable to achieve the reduction because time has passed, yet the joint remains according to its original deformity; and nothing is harmful to an infirm person except that the hand becomes weak, and they cannot grasp anything: then know that nerves have been severed or damaged.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	It is thus not to be treated with anything but the caustic near its origin.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps nothing will benefit it.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	Thus if Almahassem does not return, then apply over it the poultice which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	It should then be bound, and left for five days; afterwards it may be unbound and left, while the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however it loses its motion, and something heavy happens to it; then treat it gently with warm water and frequent massage until it is soothed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When any of the fingers are dislocated towards either side, or towards the back of the palm or its base; then extend the finger and push at the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the finger's head, and suspend it towards the side to which it is dislocated; and leave it thus for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang him up and stretch him until he equals his usual straightness.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	So when it's night, bind him according to the same account: and do not cease unbinding him by day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days until it becomes firm.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do likewise with it if the wrist is dislocated towards the belly side; bind him to that part and perform your first procedure on him until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same when it's dislocated towards other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	§ On the treatment of spine dislocations in the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When someone has a complete spinal or neck dislocation, or many vertebrae are displaced from their places, then there is no cure for it since death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And its sign is that the sick person's ejection happens without their will and they cannot hold it back; and often some of his limbs soften from this, or both legs, or both arms, or one of them; or a single vertebra moves out of place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is moved that which is often dislocated towards the four quarters.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	So what moves backwards is called gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	However, the cure for it is to consider then that if gibbosity happens from childhood, there is no cure and absolutely no recovery.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In those cases that occur due to accident, or impact, or similar causes, the ancients have already spoken of the methods of treatment in great detail.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which little returns with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I, however, have already abbreviated that which has little excuse for its abundance due to my close proximity to the intention: and by my exposition in which I explained it, and formed his instrument in a manner different from that in which they presented it, and exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say, therefore, that in the hump which occurs from the front part, there is neither a remedy nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which appears on two sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And they are not cured of them, except for that which occurs on the back itself with what I relate: and it is such that the invalid should be extended on his face onto a level platform near to the wall: and a moist covering should be spread beneath him so as not to injure his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight stick be placed fixed into the ground at the end of the platform near his head: and another stick about his feet at the other end of the platform: and the assistant should hold the stick, which is not firmly anchored into the ground.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another assistant should hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then roll over his head and underneath the patient's armpits a soft but strong belt or strap: and extend the end of the strap to the stick which is by his head: and tie him to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten the other strap over his waist, and over his knees, and near to his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligaments and tie them to another piece of wood that is by his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then each assistant should pull on a piece of wood from the side of the ligaments and not remove the two pieces of wood from their original places where they are fixed; however, as we said before, they must not be secured.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place their palms on top of the vertebrae with strength until it returns to its original position or they can put a plank over them instead.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then the doctor should attach their feet on top of the plank until it returns to its original position.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however it does not return with this cure then you should take a plank whose length is about three arm-lengths.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And the hole we spoke about earlier that is located on the wall near the weak spot should be where the end of the plank fits into it.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle part of the board over the vertebrae.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And then the doctor should put their feet on top of the other end of the plank.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And pull hard until the vertebrae is tightened back into place and returns to its original position.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you like, use the drill that is powered by hand and it is as though you are pushing into the ground at the head of the patient two pieces of wood whose length is one arm-length each; and again at his head with another two pieces of wood at the other end of the plank.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the distance between each piece of wood should be one hand-span; and now it is made so that there are holes at every place where the drill will pass through them and all the pieces of wood must be very well secured into the ground to ensure they do not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	A round piece of wood is introduced and there are two pegs on which a cord may be twisted that go through two holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	At its end is a hole into which a piece of wood the length of one's palm is fixed to be wound around; similarly there are two other pieces of wood on each side for this purpose.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the cords you have tied around the patient's chest with a peg by their head, and those that are binding their legs with a peg at their feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	A helper should stand by each peg and turn the handle with which it is wound; the physician meanwhile adjusts the bone as we have described.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the pegs that follow.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, once the bone is returned to its place and adjusted, it must be fixed there with a drying plaster and egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Next, apply lint.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	After this, place above the plaster a splint of wood that is three fingers in width or thereabouts.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	Its length should be sufficient to support the place of prominence as well as the healthy portion of the bone above it.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then bind it with the cord we have described.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	The patient should be fed soft food until they recover.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If there is any remaining prominence at the end of healing then softening and easing medicines should be administered with a long-term course of the tablets we have described.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a sheet of lead is applied to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes there is a lump at the very end of the spine; it is thought that this is due to a dislocation and indeed this bone already protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why it is not appropriate to presume that he will be healed by this medicine; for perhaps it may cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	§ On the treatment of a dislocated shoulder.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that a shoulder or arm joint can only be dislocated; unlike other joints they do not become slightly displaced or concave.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	Indeed, the shoulder joint becomes dislocated in four ways.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is to say it may be displaced either forwards or backwards.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Most often the shoulder becomes dislocated inwards; it is rarely displaced either forwards or backwards.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	The treatment for a shoulder dislocated inwards is as follows: when you join the healthy leg of the patient with their injured leg, it will be longer; the knee of the injured side will also protrude more than on the other side and they cannot bend that foot up to the groin area. There will be a place below the groin which has become swollen due to the head of the thigh bone now protruding there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	A shoulder that is dislocated outwards will present the opposite of these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	For someone whose shoulder is dislocated forwards the symptoms are as follows: they will stretch their healthy leg fully but cannot bend it at the knee without pain; when attempting to walk they are unable to take steps forward and instead drag that foot along the ground, even stepping on their own heel in doing so. Their urine is retained and the groin area becomes swollen.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of dislocation to the rear is that they cannot straighten their knee nor bend it until they have bent their hip; and their leg is also shorter than the other; and their hip is softened, and the head of the thighbone is by the groin.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of these types of dislocations is as follows: consider then that if the dislocation is old and has existed for some time, the one who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer the reduction of it, and it remains as it was before: then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it should not be assumed that an operation should be performed on them.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in the case of one whose dislocation is recent and is among one of four types of dislocation: then hasten to this, that you roll the joint, and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it right and left; perhaps it will go back into place, and no further treatment will be needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If however it does not go back in this way, then you should prepare a strong assistant, and have them stretch their leg from below: either with their hands or with a strap which is tied above their knee; another assistant stretches out their hand on top, so as to put their hands under their toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then bind with a soft strap above the hip joint, and hold one end of another strap.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the direction of the stretching be either from the front of the hip to the side of the pelvis, or from behind towards the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let all of them stretch at the same time until the patient is raised from the ground with their body and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common type among the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If then the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then for every type it is necessary that I speak of the proper cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In its proper reduction, when the dislocation is inward, the patient must lie on their healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then place a bandage over the root of the hip bone, at the point between the hip joint and the area beneath the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upward from the groin area to the higher part of the body, toward the fork.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong assistant take hold of his arms, reduce the thick area of the affected hip, and extend it outward with a vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now it has returned to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type of treatment is easier than the other types for reducing this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it slips away from you and does not obey your attempt with this type of treatment, then the two feet of the patient must be bound together with a strong yet gentle bandage over the two heels and above the knees; each length should measure four fingers' breadth from its corresponding point; and let the affected leg remain extended two fingers' length beyond the other.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the patient be suspended from the head of a wooden beam within the house; its length should measure two arms' lengths from the ground.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Next, instruct a strong youth to secure the hip joint; let another person be present with the patient; and have this other youth push against the one securing the hip with strength because the joint returns swiftly to its place.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In his own reduction, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary for the patient to lie on a bench as we described for one with a hunchback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the strap should be tightened over his leg, that is, the patient's, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then place two sticks, one at his feet and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then put an additional stick in the middle of the bench, fixed well; over which are wrapped wet cloths so as not to hurt the patient; and let this stick be between his thighs, so that he is not pulled down during the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let each assistant pull on their side, while the physician adjusts the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If it therefore yields to its return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place him on the same board again, and press it as we said for hunchbacks, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, the patient should lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg must be extended quickly; and it follows according to this same narrative on the bench: and the physician should place the palm of their right hand over the patient's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then grasp it with the other hand, and while grasping, place him extended downwards towards the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is backwards: then the patient need not be extended downwards and raised off the ground; instead, he should be placed on a hard surface; just as it must also be done when his hip is dislocated to the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two boards: and he is on his face, with straps extended; as we recently stated.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	The compression must be applied with a board over the area where the joint extends when reduction is completed as required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Its sign of recovery will not be hidden from you; this is when you extend the patient's two legs and observe them as equal in length, and the patient tightens their leg muscle, flexes it without assistance; then you know that already the limb has returned to its proper position. Then bring together the patient’s two thighs, apply a bandage, and tighten with an imemati, that is, a pulley-wheel, so that no movement of any kind occurs at the joint; and the patient should rest for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Next, release the ligature and bandage, compare the patient's leg with their other one; then if you observe them as equal length in this position, know that already the joint has been set fast; therefore discharge the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you observe any degree of softening; then reapply a bandage and tighten it according to your original technique; release the patient after three more days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then release it again and make the patient slow down their walking over both legs for a few days until they strengthen well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	On dislocations of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards - that is, backwards.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate forwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	The sign of its dislocation is when you instruct the patient to bring their leg up against their hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere to the hip: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration for all types of dislocations is to make the patient sit upright so that they can now stretch out their leg if possible over it and attach your back to their face; then place their foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then attach their knee to your palms and straighten them between your fingers above their knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then press with your palm the two sides of their knee firmly.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And have another assistant stretch out their foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	The sign of recovery is when the leg adheres to the hip with ease without exerting effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then bandage it, and make sure that the leg adheres to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Afterwards bind them together with thread for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then untie them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	The patient should not walk for several days until they have fully healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If however it resists reduction, then apply strong traction with the bandages described earlier in treatment for hip dislocation until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	# On the Treatment of Heel Dislocation #
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel bone is sometimes slightly displaced, and at other times completely dislocated posteriorly.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either towards the inside or outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	The sign of its dislocation is that you see an inflamed heel bone proceeding towards the side to which it has been dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The cure for its removal is an easy return, and it is to be stretched with ease by hand until it returns into place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In its cure when it is dislocated according to the limb, you must have the patient sit upright and have a strong assistant hold them firmly from behind at the middle of their back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you hold his foot with your right hand from its upper part and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot where the instep is located.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then pull it with two fingers of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then stretch it out with the left hand, and push the sole of the foot towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the sole of the foot towards the leg for a third time, you then pull on the instep.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it then returns by the first or second finger according to this method and you see the foot aligned, it is good; if not, then repeat the procedure on it since it has returned.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however the reduction is prevented with what we have described, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground and fix a pole firmly into the earth so that it falls between their hips; you should already have wrapped a cloth around him so he isn't hurt.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let one assistant take hold of his hip; afterwards let another assistant stretch out the foot, either with their hands or with a strap that is tied around the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the assistants stretch in opposition to each other's stretching: and a stick should be held between the patient's two hips, preventing their body from being pulled down towards their feet during the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the doctor reduce the dislocation with their hands, while another assistant holds the patient's healthy leg down towards their feet.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	A dislocation returns swiftly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When the dislocation returns and you are informed of its return: then apply a plaster and bandage, binding it tightly with strips, and tie the foot to the leg with a strap.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	You should also be wary of nerves that are above the back of the heel so as not to place a strap over them tightly and damage them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let the patient rest for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the strap loosens, tighten it; then release it on the third or fourth day and prevent the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	Should the patient attempt to walk before this time has passed, it is not safe as the strap may come undone and the joint will be damaged beyond repair with no hope of future recovery.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If the patient develops a hot swelling then it is necessary to apply cold compresses as described previously at another point of this guide, and an ointment, until it resolves.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the dislocation of the toes of the foot and its treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what has been dislocated from them be reset with a little extension without effort: and this indeed is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If however the dislocation is in certain joints of the foot's back; then it is necessary that you make the patient sit their foot on an even spot on the ground or on a board: and they stand like walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then push it with your foot with strength until it returns, and you see it now evened out, and the protrusion is no longer visible at that spot.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under their foot's belly a board with two ends that fits the whole foot.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it tight with an appropriate binding for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it and have them rest from walking for many days until they are bound fast and secure by the resetting.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Regarding types of dislocation with injury or fracture...
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of this sort happens and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often ensues; because of that it is not appropriate to presume upon curing one such as this unless you are wise in the art through long practice, merciful, pious, cautious, not rash or presumptuous; and so you should use at first only medicines which cool hot swellings: and leave the patient to divine judgement.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you perceive, or hope for recovery from ruin with mildness of illness, and where there appears something of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Try therefore to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before hot pus forms.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the member returns as we wish, then administer a regime that settles the pus: and treat the wound with what suits it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture, and separate splinters occur in the bone, then attempt their removal, and make in it what we said earlier regarding simple illnesses that precede them in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your virtue, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear: as my earlier admonition to you stated.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and safer for your body among them during your time.
