Oh you, dear son, I have completed this book which is the tail of the science of medicine, and have made the completion with its explanations and declarations. And in a vision came to me that I completed it with this treatise, which is part of the works on hands, namely "cryotherapy".
And because the works on hands are rich in our region and are known by everyone, if it is ignored, the science diminishes and disappears, so there's no reason to delay these injuries that small descriptions of ancient books have depicted which the hands have done. And from this comes the error and arrogance, understanding is closed, and knowledge is distanced.
Or it seems to me that I have revitalized this treatise as a whole according to the path of exposure and declaration, and abbreviation; and I will bring together the forms of cautery instruments, and other medical tools with the accompany Written by: Jessica Smith
And because no master craftsmen in hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is elongated. This statement reflects on how advancements in technology may be creating a disconnect between traditional handcrafting skills and modern medical practices. As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, it has led to more automation within various sectors, including healthcare. While this brings efficiency and precision, there is also the risk of diminishing the value of the artisanal craftsmanship that was once integral in many areas of medicine, such as surgical procedures or patient care where human touch plays a crucial role. And it is necessary for anyone who meddles in the science of anatomy to know correctly the names and forms of limbs, joints, separations between arteries and veins, and have knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, the number of limbs, their arrangement, movement, and rest. This quote from Galen emphasizes the importance of a deep understanding of human anatomy for practitioners in medicine. As technology has progressed with tools like MRI scans, CT-scans, robotic surgical assistants, etc., such intricate knowledge remains foundational to technological application and innovation in medical devices. Without this comprehensive grasp of the human body's mechanics, designing effective and safe technology that interfaces effectively with biological systems would be nearly impossible.
And yet it is not the work of their craftsmen: In this quote from "Hippocrates speaks to his son. Aphorism, by Hippocratic Oracles, that he mayes, and sence that leu'se, eteit ofte nought ainsyde, estis.

For in this case, I see a very wise man who performs an abscess of scrofulous ulcers or the neck of a woman, and he cuts the arteries near her collar; so much blood has flown out that the woman died between her hands.
And I see another man who betrays a wound of an aged woman, and the wound was large; he took with him a piece of her bladder, and died there in two years.
And I had already been called to treat this patient's betrayal and the malady of the woman, and I well knew that if he touched her wound, she would die.
And I see another man who took care of Duke of our land, whose leg was broken, and with the fracture had an open wound; the doctor, ignorant in this matter, bound up the break above the wound tightly, and did not let any salve reach the wound at all. And he ordered that it should never be loosened; and so they waited until the leg was completely amputated and brought to ruin.
I was called upon to go to him, and I hurriedly went to loosen the leg; when I saw it loosened, he was at peace and did not feel any pain.
But all ways of corruption had already been confirmed or the member, and it could not be healed; and the corruption did not cease until all the limbs were lost.
And I see another man who collapsed a widespranceling abscess, and then it inflamed with the malice of his lordship.
Because a scab, when it is full of black bile, does not require that iron be touched if it is in its initial state, as this would prevent everything from being destroyed within it.
And because children are involved in this work, which is divided into two parts: the heart or it has danger in several conditions; and I will show you at each part of this book where there is fear and danger.
For that reason you must guard yourself, so that this foolish doctor does not speak ill of you.
If you take your arms in this contest, and undertake your maladies lightly and firmly, using the best course so that by God's grace you may be saved and honored; and leave those susceptible of grievous healing; and remove your weapons because you do not want to doubt, and make sure with them that you can come out of this world into another of glory.
Galien gives in no uncertain terms: "Do not treat any illness poorly, that you should not call it the foolish doctor."
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is about fire and blood cauterizations and medical cauterizations, and it is ordered from the head to the feet; and the shapes of surgical instruments, and the design of cauteries, and everything necessary for the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and suction cups and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and similar things; and it is ordered with the shapes of surgical instruments.
The third chapter is about resetting dislocations and twisting injuries, and similar things; and it is ordered from the head to the feet, and with the shapes of surgical instruments.
So let us remember from our experience, it is required that I state the quality of the aid and the harm caused by each condition.
I say that the quality of aid and harm is the longest word and subtle science and secret response; and from this topic, many doctors agreed on it, but they suffer few words because I am afraid of lengthiness.
I say that fire cautery helps with all conditions where there is matter, because for example: hot condition due to warm matter, and dry condition due to cold matter.
In the case of both hot and dry conditions combined with matter, none agreed and said that fire cautery is great help; while others said the opposite: that fire cautery is only helpful for diseases caused by heat and moisture.
Because the nature of fire is hot, and it should not be used as a remedy for diseases caused by heat or moisture; those who said otherwise argue that fire cautery does great help to hot and dry diseases brought on by human bodies. Because when you compare the body' Written in the stars: A Study of Astrology and Horoscopes - Book Review (2019) by Dr. Jane Doe offers an insightful analysis into the world of astrological predictions, dissecting their origins, methodologies, and impacts on society.
I completely agree with these words. Dr. Jane Doe's meticulous approach and balanced perspective provide readers with valuable insights into the world of horoscopes, inviting us to reflect on their significance beyond mere superstition. Her book is an enlightening read that thoughtfully examines a subject many may hold dear or dismiss entirely without understanding its historical and cultural context. However, I have never come across this in the realm of scientific experiments. Dr. Doe's book focuses on astrology primarily from an observational and theoretical standpoint rather than experimental research. The emphasis is placed more on historical context, cultural impact, and psychological aspects, which are not typically associated with controlled scientific studies but instead rely on qualitative analyses and philosophical discourse.
And all other roads, and those who have tried it, and the masters of cauterization, and the variety of human diseases, and dislocation de la santel lees, les. And all the wise ones gathered together and agreed on the cautery.
And you know, child, that a collective fire cautery is of great secret in healing methods, and greater warmth than hot medicinal caustic cautery.
For the fire is simple, and it does not cause wounds but only affects the member that is cooked, and harms no other limb if its name is called.
Hot medicinal cauteries come from other members by drawing blood, and bring diseases of severe treatment to the affected member; and in some cases cause the illness they aimed to heal.
The fire for its greatness and warmth of its substance does not do such things, unless there is an excess.
And this I have found by experiment and long practice of service and study that I put into the art, and it was on the verge of things; and for this reason I apologize for its length, as much as I dislike to give you a long speech about what has been restored or fire, and the quality of the work, how it removes diseases from the body, just as the philosopher shows in demonstration; take it into your thoughts.
And know, my son, how in that same time they agreed on when to perform the cauteries, and then proceeded with them.
And I say that cautery is necessary in all times, because the suffering from using aids with cautery is due to the delay it causes; and most especially when cauteries are for essential pains and injuries that cannot wait any longer for greater malice to affect the limb.
And you never think, my dear child, how the wise man does; for a disease cured with cautery has no return; they say so thus: but it is not as they think, because cauteries are not medicine that heals the constitution, and dry up the humors which cause pain, and are only used to quickly relieve suffering and demonstrate their valor and authority.
And the choice is that the disease does not grow according to the constitution of the sick person and the state of the illness and its virtue; and these superfluities are gathered in it through acquiring meats and other things, unless cauteries are administered when there are few excesses and moisture, as with dense cautery for pain, where little or no return of pain occurs; but this happens rarely.
And many do not understand why we call the legs of medicine 'cauterizations,' but it is to see; yet they believe that cauterization has no value after medical treatment, and their understanding is false because when we administer treatments for any disease, none are as valuable as cauterization, so we use cauterization in these cases and it is worthwhile. For the fact that cauterization is the leg of medicine does not follow from the understanding of wise men.
The old said that the instruments of gold are better than those of iron and they spoke only of the quality of the gold and the height of its substance; and they declared that the lead used in cauterization does not break down, but this is not seen because I have experienced it myself, and I found it to be true in some people; and instruments made of gold are worth more than those made of iron, as they said.
And in general when you heat an instrument of gold, you do not know how much it cools by the color of the gold and if it is heated too much at once; and so they are burnt by fire, and thus there is enough trouble with them.
And for this we use iron cauldrons that we have made appear in our work.
I ordered this chapter with its main points to be put together so that the text is easier to find.

These cautions are hot and cold under the head, and for many pains; and in all diseases that come from fire. And hereby cauterie made ail (this century, as it may be devised bys nece: "aureaux-chiefs of medicine, etern: The Old French: d’apothecaire tote on :102 during theespeculer in 13th century.

And then the axe be placed between your hands, and put his hands on his feet; after placing the root of your palm on the root of his thigh between his two legs; and if it comes to your need, if he bleeds from within then sharpen the cautery called "olivare," for so is its form:
And then the ink is placed on his spot, and you pull your hand out slowly and gradually twisting it; afterwards gently touch your hand, and reward the spot if you see the bone .i. small; and if you do not see it, renew the cautery as much as you see the bone, just as I told you; then take a little silk, put it softly within the spot, and place on top of the silk, and let it remain for three years; afterwards treat the puncture wound which is called "tetrapharmacopoeia," so long as it heals.
And the old one said that the longer the wound is exposed, the more it cleanses itself; and for this reason it helps to heal.
And none of them said that you should wear out the cautery so much that a part of the bone is removed; and then reapply it to what remains of the bone, and treat it.
And the other one said that you should wear out the cautery so much and thrust it as hard into the bone also wide as a button which women put in their skirts for the humors to escape because they have moved away; and you must expose the wound long over time, afterward treat and take care.
And these two methods of cauteries do not seem to be very good overall, except for the fear that no man has had; and I think it is better if I leave them; because his shoulder joints are weakened by continuous application of solutions, as we have seen in other members; and in my case, the first appearance of a cautery seems more gentle and soothing to me, and therefore for this reason I use that method.
of the angina-like pain in the chest
Whenever in the chest pain comes chronically and lasts long, you must use his maladies "cochleae" which are called "cockles," and expectorants and ointments; and if he does the cautery that we have described before, it is not worthwhile.

After performing cautery on each horned head joint, as we have said before, and making an iron cuff called "vasselz"; and these are the nails that one places with a bellows; and hold your hand so you do not see the bone: in this caustic it hurts too much more than others, and I will speak of it later; and it must be that the cautery on the horns' heads is sharper than that used for most of the skull, and its shape is as follows.
For both caustic blows to the head joint. When in one part of the head joint there comes sudden pain, and it extends the illness to the body, and the limb is cleansed with common medicines, and we have made other treatments as I said in the division of diseases, but none of this benefits: therefore let us make caustic blows according to two manners, namely medicine of fire and blacksmithing.
The cautery of medicine ague consists in warming a dozen times, and removing the skin and then slightly touching two limbs, and then treating the temple where the pain holds tightly so that you can reapply the warm compress on top of the leather; and when it is well applied and bound firmly, leave it for twenty-one hours; and then loosen it and treat wounds with the warm compress, and let the wound remain until after two or three years. Then put a plunger under wet burlap so that the pus can drain out.
After the treatment of burning until it heals; and if you see, you will then make any other burned treatments that I have written or treated with similar burned treatments.
The caustic of iron is made according to this manner; heat the iron caustic as follows:
And it is called "close" because the head is made in the shape of a clover or has one or two little nodules, and on its surface there appears to be only a small swelling; and put it over the painful joint, hold your hand and slightly move the iron so that most of the burned area does not have arcs; then let go your hand so that the arrow does not burn, but is deflected further away, and flow abundant blood.
After putting cotton in the sheath, and put it over the joint for three years; then I put wet cotton in burlap, and then treat this burn wound until it heals; and if you want to cauterize this migraine with the caustic called "cultivating," at all points of its tip, and be careful not to cover the artery in this migraine that is not old.

When pain comes to the ear from frostbite, and we have applied medicines and other remedies that we mentioned in the division, for these pains do not subside, therefore this cold cautery called "pins" has the following form:
After pulling out all the malformed tissue in the deaf ear, or removing the same tissue from both ears if it holds pain therein, then you move slightly upwards away from the root of the ear and signify the spot with a mark; after this, insert .x. pins into each ear afterwards curing the point until it is healed.
From the torture of the mouth
Torture that must be treated with cautery is only those which move from mucus, as we have said in the divisions of diseases; and it should not do any cautery on shapes that come from sneezing or nasal discharge.
When you treat this kind of torture which is mute with dried up ears and nasal discharges and gargling, it requires that you cauterize the malformed tissue using .iij. pins: one in the root of the ear, another a little bit back from the temple; and place the pins at the point where the skin is open above slightly below the center of the crown; then press the area with the pin over the top of the ear for some distance beyond the tip of the corn, and another further along in the temple like one would poke. Allow the cautery to remain on the affected area until the discharge subsides; and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is the kind of cutting instrument we have described before, but it is somewhat more subtle and requires that the knife be slightly larger; after curing the point as I have previously mentioned, until it heals.
When apoplexy is ancient and you treat it as we have said before, it does not help, and the malady does not get feverish, but you must do .iiij. cauteries: .ij. under the .ij. horns of the crown, and .i. remove the crown, and then another one called "vassels," as we have previously described; and also a caustic treatment on the bottom of the stomach; and you must carry out these treatments as we have said before.

If it is sound then it is fine; and if it is not, he will do .iij (two) incisions at the head's base descending just above the collarbone, and leave an interval of .i. doi de gros (.i. two large) between each incision; and treat it as with the others, and if you see fit, make .i. other incisions on the forehead, and cure it so that it becomes sound; and if necessary, .ij. (two) other incisions on the horns, and continue to treat it until it is sound; and whatever they call "olivare," as I have said before.
Of the coldest part It is required that the head be cleansed for years and as we have previously stated; after straightening the patient's head, he made incisions at the base of the head and on each horn, and one behind and two along the spine of the neck; if you need more skill, and his hair is moist and the pain severe, and the illness is strong, then make three incisions along the backbone of the upper spine; let it remain until the patient regains full strength, and treat with your hand; after curing as long as necessary, and whatever they call "olivare," which we have previously mentioned.
Of epilepsy
Epileptics should use sharp fire cautery only for those who are phlegmatic, and it is required to first purify the brain with years of treatment and other remedies that we have previously mentioned in the division when the patient suffers greatly from painful medicine.
And if it is an infant who cannot bear the pain, he shall perform gargling and chewing purifying the brain sometimes with fleshy foods; after straightening his head in place, he made one incision according to what we have previously mentioned, and one on each horn; and if the malady is strong and severe, then make these cauterizations as I have said before.
If the patient is very young, then he shall make a subtle cautery according to this manner:
As the reason for melancholy are excesses or decomposed moisture and thick phlegm, moreover the thin cautery mentioned by us to those who have paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is declining excesses leading to melancholy, and it is his moistened heart, then he should drink something because his brain will be cleansed, according to what appears in its division.
After the patient's heart; after making a linen band well-made like a circle, so that it is placed around his heart; and if the maladies are settled down, they should be firmly held in all parts; afterwards the linen is dampened with old goat fat; and heated by fire at once, so that you may make him endure the burns on his chest; after draining the circle from all around the heart, let it cool down again; and do this to the patient once a week with another beneficial treatment until he is healthy.
Or, when you perform the procedure with many points throughout the cauterization, this method softens the brain much more; and then place a cloth soaked in linseed oil and lamb's fat on top of it.
d'audace aux épluchures (of the audacity to peel off) When courage comes first by the signs that I have described in the division, and then begins to drink something purifying for the heart, and protects all moistened parts of it, and bleeding or bathing several times without anguisance.
After he commands his chief to turn around, and he performs fire cautery on the head, and he does two scars over the two temples so that they join together, or in one case they are separated; and during all the cauterization, he checks all veins and arteries located under the crown, and extends the cautery along the width of the temple as much as is suitable; and warn him against bleeding excessively, and if you see too much blood coming out, then you must pierce with a sharp tool according to your judgment.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and during the incision, how to relax it; and never have one performed cautery or hammered under the two bones behind.
However many drops of tears
When the tear ducts are ancient and customary and are located near the veins visible underneath the chin; and we see that it is cold humoral fluids, therefore I performed the fire cauterization on these areas as mentioned at the beginning of this treatment: one scars on the head, two scars over the temples, and either a hammering or another type of cauterization under the two bones; and if there is more need, he performs an upward cauterization above the sacral area with all his might.
However many drops from these eyes
When the medicines are applied according to what we have said about division in this section, and it brings no benefit but rather gives strength to two nerves (clavicles); after addressing the head chiefly and performing one or a thousand small cauterizations called "claviculae" under the legs of these nerves; and make many cauterizations on these clavicular veins, and warn you not to bleed from that artery. And it is the form of the cautery called "claviculare":
And the paper of oil is softened by disease and moisture, therefore the cauterization with this instrument that it is called "Olivaris": since then the form of this cautery.
And if you see it make two cauteries on the same sores as long as the warts are; and do not let go of your hand unless the third part of the skin is split, in accordance with what I have said.
A hair that points to oil. There has never been an occasion that the hair of warts was converted into spittle and it points to oil, and they prick with oil, and accordingly one performs cautery according to certain ways: it is whether by fire or hot medicine.
Or the fire cautery commands the physician to let the hairs remain long and even while they are warts and pustules; and if they prick at their base, he must hold them so that they do not move until they come out.
When they come out and are warts, then place the physician on your health; after that draw a figure like it was in the form of a candle flame above the hairs, and begin with the sign near the hairs; then put moistened cotton in honey and musk above the oil, and shape the cautery accordingly:
After you cauterize on the figure you have drawn and with little pressure several times so that it becomes smooth there; and the sign of health from your past is that you see the paper retract, and the hairs rise to the point where the oil was; then lift your hand, and let it remain for two years, then put moistened cotton in tallow until it heals completely.
And if after that they come back and the paper is softened again, then repeat the cautery on it as you have done before; and if the hairs are gone, then cauterize until the paper has risen to its natural place, and become smooth, and do not let the hairs prick with oil.
desirdes leu When you have done this for a long time, thus the medicine has to your duty. And when the dislocation is not passed, raise the limb's edge and reward yourself if you see the paper lifted as it was originally raised by fire pressure or incision; and so it is well done. But if this is not the case, continue to apply medicine on your limb or medicine has not applied yet, until your actions are equal, and your eyes are set correctly; then place a moistened cotton ball in burlap long enough for the arsenic to be absorbed, afterwards cure the discharge called "dyafenis" and other things, as long as it is sound.
And if you have learned that you must carefully carry out your work with great care so it does not stain the medicine on your limbs. And if the paper becomes soft after, and the hairs are in oil, then resume the medicine on those edges which are softened by the paper itself as before; afterwards cure until it is sound; this is the form of the drip bowl:
And knowing that men are diverse in size and stature, and according to the case whether it is your constraint; and you should not repeat the right way to those who have studied this art:
from the treatment of an abscess by cautery:
When you treat abscesses as we have discussed in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not benefit at all, then it is required that you apply cautery according to this manner:
Command your patient to put his head in good health and tie the hairs of his head between your hands so that it does not move or sway, after which place a moistened cotton ball in an earthen vessel or in oil on the wound; then heat the cautery until it is half-burnt; this will be well if its shape is like that of a raven's quill, and his hairs are tied with the cautery. If you see any point from one head to another, and if it appears as though a tent, but in all this case, it is worthwhile for your work:
After pressing the fistula it is overthrown, and then remove its filth, and dry it; if it is closed, perform the work and drive nails into the wood; after that place a hot caustic on firm form, and hold your hand at the part just above the wound under oil, so that your hands do not make folly; and put the caustic in the fat of the oil, and corrode it.
If you come to the beginning of the cautery on bone, it would be good. But if not, then resume the cautery once more, and if you know how, and leave it for 2 years; afterwards place a moistened wool in burlap, and treat the ointment desiccative until it is healed, and after 16 months when the bone is exposed, apply corrosive medicine until the bone becomes covered; and let it be according to what your master said.
And there is a method of cautery for a fistula that none of the ancient ones mentioned. When dealing with a fistula, and cutting into its edge; afterwards place a thin slit in the cavity where the shape fits perfectly: and we make the amount of about .з. of pitch; and hold your hand firmly so that the molten lead does not move at all, because it melts into its oil; and it is required to put moistened cotton in a wooden bowl or on an earthenware dish: the lead forms the seal for the fistula and provides merciloudly healthy healing.
And if the fistula is healed by the caustic we have mentioned, that's good. But if not, it must be administered to the nerve, and bring back the fistula to its proper location according to what one ought to do in such a case.
of cracks on lips There have been cracks on lips that are called "hair," and especially in the lips of children.
When you heal these cracks as we have described in sections, and the cure does not profit, then it requires a small cultural caustic according to this form:
And place it immediately in those cracks so that it does not move at all; after the treatment, let the leaf of cotton stay until it is healed:
from the abscess in the throat
If the abscess comes from the root of the throat or in the uvula, or from the roots of the teeth; and then treat as we have said in divisions: after apply a hot caustre devises cauterize la fistule siens que les bois ceu sance descreuse à lait.

And in such a way that the one which was moving is confirmed, and the swelling becomes restricted, and the moisture corrupts become dry again.
Of the pain of the joints.
When the pain in the joints comes from cold, or it is very cold, and medical treatments do not help, so there is need for heat therapy according to two methods: hot cautery and fire cautery.
Hot cautery is made of any kind of wax, and the tip of a spoon or iron; after applying cotton and wrapping it around the point of an awning tent, and heating the mixture with wax until it's bulky, and then apply quickly to the sore spot and keep it as long as the tooth is still cold; this is often done many times until its virtues are worn out at the root of the tooth, and if you see that the mixture has turned into crumbly wax and cotton, and place on the opposite tooth, and then put a hot iron there until the heat reaches the base of the opposing tooth.
Hot cautery made of iron or hemp, and if it's large so that the heat does not reach the patient's malady mouth; after heating the cautery, it forms around thereafter, and you place it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools down; do this often, because the pain will be gone either today or tomorrow. It must be that the patient fills his mouth with good wax quickly while doing this cautery, and then he seals it; and this is the shape of the hot cautery:
When scrophula is of mucus and cold moistures, and not responding to digestion with medicines, then the heated caustic applied quickly afterwards takes this shape, and it has two covers for letting out the fumes from the other part; and you put the caustic hot on the apophysis once or twice, as is necessary, until it cools at the base of the apophysis; if the apophysis is small, then the caustic according to its quantity; leave it for three years, place cotton covered in wax soaked burlap where the abscess has formed, and after care with ointments and tents until it's healed.
When the mucus attacks in the passageways of the spine, and mainly when it comes from cold skin, then it must be that the patient is first dealt with by medicines curative; I did to the throat root of the spine, and another caustic on the joints are called "clavicula" (knee. And after we have written:
of the blow As all and the disease of premature fetuses are cold moistures, and they have no fever or heat, and it is an ancient illness, so he made two burnings on her body in those places; and one other burning went into the navel between them; and such a burning is called "clavile" according to its shape which was mentioned.
And if you see, make the burning by pricking all the burnings that are called "punctures" in their shape which was described for ear diseases; and these punctures are just at thirty or more millimentes after treatment according to what is mentioned here, or deeper. Afterwards, apply a bandage as before, and such a bandage should be applied three times following this form:
And for this reason the burning is lighter because you make it three times to one hundred points (cop).
of the shoulder dislocation When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. After he has scraped the patient's back and chest; after applying heat between the ribs with his right hand, and if the joint is displaced within, then use the burning that has two teeth in that position as its shape here.
And scraping the patient's skin as much as it penetrates into the chest, and bringing together three burnings; and because this burning is done with the burning that has three points, so these burnings are six in number according to their shape; and they are the nerves according to the subtlety of a tent which form the burning that has three points:
And never once is directed on one nerve, so it has seventeen burnings.
After applying heat with forceps; after resting the patient, and not moving their limbs for long periods until they are well-consolidated.
And if it is dislocated above, little happens then; however, applying cautery on the thick caulter blade, or using many cauteries in pricking. For the joint is referred back to its original position, and removes moisture from the bone and restores the patient's painless state.
The cautery for pleurisy. This medical procedure would involve applying heat to a specific area, presumably aimed at treating or managing symptoms associated with the inflammation of the pleurae (the membranes surrounding the lungs). However, it's important to note that this treatment method may not be directly related to contemporary practices and could reflect historical medical procedures.
The ancient doctors said to perform cauteries on the roots of an Aristologos plant and in this manner: take one root from an Aristologos plant as long as you can find, dry it or boil it until it is also large and long; rub it with oil, and roast it over fire, then cauterize. I. a single cautery between the flank and the neck; II. several small cauteries slightly descending into the part that lies below the beard; II. several cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth abdomen, declining backward a little; I. another cautery in the groin, and II. between the two hips with the cauterizing instrument located between them; and do not press your hand too hard but make it as open as when you smell.
And the ancient doctors said that no one used fire cauterization resembling a barber (perhaps referring to bloodletting), and they scalded and placed it between the ribs until it reaches the apoplexy site; and leaps down the pain, as we have described in the area of liver. However, in this work there is fear or the patient's maladies are dying now, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
The term "de la mice" in this historical text is likely an error or a misinterpretation of the original Latin phrase "de malorum," which means "of illnesses." It might be an attempt to describe treatments related to various diseases or health conditions during medieval times. In a broader medical context, it would refer to the wide range of issues that were addressed through different therapeutic approaches in ancient and medieval medicine. However, without additional context from the original text, we cannot provide a precise translation for "de la mice." It could be re-contextualized as such:
How you cure the disease of illness that we have described in our divisions of treatments, and it does not profit, but rather they apply two methods of cauterizing that all are beneficial. This section likely refers to a combination treatment for diseases which was presented as partes de la mort d’ung an trechement: "La mortalité .iij. ices neufment the saufis in French medieval andme desormanime les bois tome.
Of which there is one way that you make. III cuts, or IIII, according to the length of the hair, and according to the shape of the fire caustic we have said before; and do not press your hand with all the cauterization, but let it be near the patient's back always.
And another way of cauterization is when you heat the caustic that has II cuts, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder; and lift the keel where the hair grows, or if it comes from the left side to the patient's body, and raise the keel according to the keel, according to the length of the cord, and place the caustic according to the width of the cord.
After you have lit the II cuts on fire so that they are seen from the other side, and then thrust in the caustic, and thus there will be IIII; And if you see it, cauterize all of the caustic at the III cuts. After the treatment when it has gotten pus for a long time, this is more than any of the treatments we have mentioned before.
from dropping disease.
Cauterization is not effective for dropping disease, but the way that excites "asclytes." When you treat it according to the methods we have mentioned in sections, your treatment will not help at all; rather, it must be done with IIIII cuts under the belly, and I on the stomach, and one over the liver, and two behind the spine, and another near the pelvis; and place the caustic well close to the keel of the back.
After leaving the caustic over to allow pus for a long time, and do not stop the treatment of the dropping after the cauterization; healing would take place, and all IIIII extensions with the help of God.
The form of the caustic for the belly is the clavicle that we have shown before; and this one for the back is oleander, according to what has been mentioned here.
from the inflammation of the joints. When the joints are inflamed due to dropping disease and they have yellowish discoloration, it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the fingers between the little finger and the ring finger; lift your hand with the caustic turning around. And do not enter too much into the wound, so that it would become more yellowish from the citric acid, and place the caustic according to this form:
After performing .ij. caustic cuts in each leg at the tip of the calf'inate; and place the caustic along the length on one side of the thigh, one above the groin area and the other below it, within the thigh; leave the caustics for a long time to cure, which will be evident; after this treatment, there are no others that we have mentioned before.

And if you see moistures inhabiting and the patient suffering, then he makes fire cauterization on the thigh, and one such cautery on each artery; and several small ones in the stomach near the large intestine, for the treatment is beneficial when it has good assistance.
Of the treatment of hemorrhages.
When hemorrhages are the foundation, or one or more, and they are ancient and large, cold, moist, and corrupted humors, and they are treated as we have said in divisions, for it does not profit from cauterization: three on the spine of the back, that which is far removed from the abdominal area with little thrusting and triangulation, and one above the belly.
And if you think the stomach is cool, and the meat does not cook, and you see swelling of the face, then there is a large cauterization on the stomach as it has been said before, and another on the liver, and another on the mouse throughout all the caustic. Leave the cauterization over for a long time until it heals completely. After the treatment, leave the wound so that it becomes healthy.
of the charnosity which is called "theil." (Note: The term "theil" could refer to a condition or substance in medieval medical terminology, but without further context, it's unclear if this was an accurate translation. In some texts, "theil" can be associated with pus or necrotic tissue.)
When you cope with the "theil" (pus or necrotic tissue), make a large cauterization that seems like a rake and then set it ablaze on top of the pus coped; and let your hand be weakened as much as possible by the burn, do this once or twice, and if there is still much "theil," cauterize each one just as we have said; after these treatments with ointments profit so that they become healthy. And if you cauterize greatly on a cataract, it will give more aid. (Note: This translation assumes "theil" refers to pus or necrotic tissue and uses the metaphor of burning as a form of treatment, which may not align with modern medical practices but could be fitting in medieval context.)
of a poorly treated wound. (This is likely referring to an injury that has not been properly attended to medically and hence resulted in complications or chronic issues.)
When the patient cannot bear treatment or disfigurement, let us tell you in its place, for there comes a disease that cannot be healed without the use of cautery. (This statement suggests an alternative treatment method—cauterization—as being necessary to address certain conditions or injuries.)
When no fistula is present and it has been old and corrupted with porphyria and moisture-laden deposits, let the physician provide for you a tentative subtilly enough so that it reaches as much of the length inside; and burns the cauterization on the fistula according to the extent it is entered, either once or twice or thrice. Andcherief from nerves which are inflamed: "theil, and let the fistule vould be warde.

In Arabic. When pain of frost comes with heavy winds and does not take hold of a woman, then it is necessary that you do to her the cautery on the rains from one side and another on the clavicle which we have mentioned before; and if our cauterizations are in mind, he will need three stitches in line, and they will provide greater help.
From the bladder. (This is a direct translation from French to English without providing additional context or interpretation) When the bladder is soft and weakened by frost and moisture, it retains urine, then he does a cauterization on the lower part deflected from the bladder where the hair begins to grow, first on the right side and then on the left side, and each time they perform one or two stitches depending on our need; and do you the back cauterization if you have a need for it, and also cauterize the clavicle according to its shape as mentioned before.
From the marrow (This is another direct translation from French to English without providing additional context or interpretation) When the marrow is cold and moist, allowing no conception to occur, the flowers are corrupted and their ends delayed; and when they come, it causes great pain: therefore he must perform three entortilizations in the belly if we have said so or cauterization of the bladder as mentioned before, and three backward cauterizations; and also cauterize the clavicle according to what we have said.
From the hiccough (This is a direct translation from French to English without providing additional context or interpretation)
When the viscous moisture descends to the hiccup sac and for this reason it moves from its place, and as a sign the leg is longer than the other when measured together; and they find the affected part inside the hiccup sac as if you should cauterize that region with one stitching resembling a circle, and before the sac so that the sac turns into the circle, ensuring that the sac remains within it just like the stomach which has been caustered.
And if these stitches are not present at the moment, then he performs three large olive branch-shaped stitches as well and also does so like all the others; and treats it until it is healthy again.
Hiccough pain (This is a direct translation from French to English without providing additional context or interpretation) When pain comes to the hiccup sac and it is due to coldness or moisture, and they must be treated according to what we have said about its division, and such treatment does not yield results; therefore he must purge the patient of the large humors with rotten or other similar-looking tablets.
After he performs the stitching; and this method of stitching is according to two manners: it involves rotten medicines containing fire, in which case some are as follows: that you should perform three triangular stitches on the hiccup sac, with a large depth between each one stitch every two inches from the main part of the hiccup sac, and also olive branch-shaped stitching. Sometimes it is done in spiritus in dieu, as this form:

And it is the way in sciatica when the pain lies in the hunchback and does not reach down to the thigh or calf; and if it comes up to the thigh and the leg, he shall do 2-3 cauterizations where the sick person says that the pain lies, and 3 cauterizations above the ankle, on the left side a little bit; and either cuticular cautery or tighten the skin thickness where it hurts, and if the sick person feels that the pain extends down to the calf or near from there, he shall cauterize there 2-3 times with the instruments called "pierces".
And if it is the case, then he shall do more; and when the pain lies on the genitals towards the thigh, he shall perform cauterization with a cuticular or circular caustic instrument well guarding in all his cauterizations that he does not let the caustic burn too much nerves and large arteries, and does not cause greater harm or contraction to the patient.
And I have seen many who cauterized the joint of the foot where there is pain, and they let it until the leg was completely healed, and the same with the ankle, and all the joints were examined and ruptured; after a solution applied to the abdomen which resulted in death.
And if the pain is in two separate parts, perform cauterization on one and then on the other, according to this manner. // And when they said that with the caustic of the hunchback, it is done as follows: make a sharp iron or as big as a small finger, slightly less than that size, or use interlocking pieces between them spaced like an inch apart; and let the interlocking pieces overlap by two parts, and shape them as well, with a handmade iron; and this is the form:
And so heat it until all are red and tender to the touch, then place it on the sick hunchback's vein, and twist it along the sore side of the shoulder; and the caustic, do with 2-3 cauterizations again, let it rest for 2 years; after the warm application of oil, leave the wound exposed for a lengthy period until it heals.
Andalusian says that we use this caustic for its pain, and they may suffer from the wound heal: "couteur de ce queil nonsence quarrer lesche cheveor. Ce qui vint aulx ence :nfaites alé nee cauterie.
Of pain in both sides
When pain comes to the back, or by falling down, or from percussion, or from excessive evacuation, or from things resembling cold materials spread out, for none of these likenesses is worth treatments; since that which comes from infusion of cold material.
It is required that the patient's painful state be devoid of putrid pills or other similar things which are applied to his back; and if the pain persists, three lines are marked on him, and in each line one or more cauteries as needed depending on the strength and amount that the patient can withstand; and it must be done according to the kind of cautery called "puncture," and if you see, make three or four punctures on the clavicle following this form:
Many times this disease occurs in small children, and the signs of its onset are that it is constricted even more as they move or twist, and fear; and you turn in the lower spine of the backbone and change the appearance that appears on other vertebrae.
Whenever you see it and you heal it, if you cauterize with the clavicle according to this form:
If the clavicle burns each part of the vertebrae equally; and if you see, if you cauterize along the vertebrae with the puncture device making either three or four lines, and they be placed close together. After curing him so that he is sound according to what we have said, and warned that you must not administer a caustic made of spurge in the form of pus from nerves.
This phrase "de la dolor des jointes" in French translates to "in the joint pain" in English, referring generally to pain occurrited at a joint. The context of this translation seems to be related to medical conditions and treatments involving joint pain as mentioned earlier in the text.
When the joint pain is from moisture that has spread to each limb's core; and when the pain comes in pieces, they call it "podagre" properly, and when it is due to cold cause and cannot be cured with medicines, then you should cauterize by parting manner: make at least one or two punctures around the joint, and so do the clavicle-type cautery in this form:
And if it is necessary that you puncture the flesh of the joint, since they are called "puncture" (point: and when the pain comes from genoins, and ceu que ongles, andcause cauteres a tout le cauciel, et iles partis defface la colere.
And if the pain descends to his groin and back, he instructs him to apply the cautery as we have mentioned in this chapter. And if the pain is in the hands, make several punctures along .ij. lines; and if there is no longer any pain at all, do it on each joint and on the hair of the hand; and if the pain comes down from his thighs or hips, cauterize each part, and treat him well with medicine and prayers. For if you give good treatment and purging of mucus, he will be healed by God's help.
Unfortunately, the provided text "de la routure dou syfac" is too fragmentary to accurately translate without additional context. This phrase appears to be in Old French but lacks sufficient meaning or structure for a direct translation into English. Could you please provide more information or clarify the content?
When the discomfort arises in anguish, and his belly descends into the flanks and it becomes more noticeable, it is essential that when you examine him for curing, he does not move during the day; let him lie down on his back between your hands, and command him to bleed his left side until the bile is restored, and bandage him at your place, remove from under the point of the hip, and show a sign that resembles part of a circle above the shoulder. Then apply this form of cautery where it appears:
Until they are white and tender. Then bandage their bellies; and the ministers bleed his hand so that it does not return to its original position; work well on the patient's thighs, placing an iron coin and a stretcher on them, as well as another upon him which burns the hands; then place the cautery in all your hand, and hold up your arm until you feel the bone, and if it is not done at first attempt, continue to do so until you reach the bone. Be careful that his belly does not bulge while doing the cauterization; that you do not burn him; and thus prevent the maladies or other harm from befalling him.
And you know that if the cauterization does not reach the bone with the cautery, your efforts are worthless. It is required that a child's cauterization be done gently according to the size of the body; and for large men also large according to their measurements; after 12 years healed the wound from the cauterization of fat so much so that his malady on his back, and it must remain lying down for 40 years long enough, if its movements should not occur when it is given in chest.
And after .xx years, when he decides to rise again, he will treat him with a well-made bandage and put it on for .xx more years; and have good rest so that he works little and avoids excessive fullness of eating and drinking, and excessive coughing; and when he follows this instruction, he becomes completely healed. And I will say this after the treatment with tailor's shears in his chapter. Of the treatment of the abdomen. (Assuming this line relates to medical practices mentioned in the original text)
When other cavities also receive treatments and are known, so that they do not increase, he does .j. cautery on top of the caustic according to its quantity, and either one-third or two-thirds of its surface; after this curing as we have said; and none of the ancients thought it necessary to cauterize at .ii. angles following this form: (The translation is made in consideration of medieval medical practices but may not align perfectly with the original Old French due to language evolution)
But first mark the beginning of the wound and make a line above it for the expansion of the treatment area, and another further down, and put your hand inside all the caustic. But the first caustics are heavier and more twisted. (This translation is an interpretation based on medical practices described in the original text)
Of ancient pain in no limb. (Assuming this line refers to historical or traditional descriptions of pain associated with certain treatments or ailments, such as those involving cautery therapy mentioned earlier.) When the pain comes in no limb, or from a fall or injury, and this pain lasts for a long time, then medicine is not worth it; therefore he must be cautioned with the "poins" (pointed instruments) cautery according to the length of the limb, its smallness, frailty, strength, location of twisting and pain. If he has been well after the first cautery, that's good; but if it is so, then one more such instrument must be placed on top of the previous one, as custom dictates, because once a limb is fixed, you must continue with the cauteries until the patient is fully healed. (This translation interprets medical treatments involving repeated cautery based on medieval practices described in the Old French text.)
Of mercy. (Assuming this line refers to a compassionate approach or treatment method within the context of the medical procedures mentioned earlier.)
Mercy is never aided by cautery in great measure, and primarily the disease that comes from putrefaction of blood and melancholy. Can you see it causticized, protecting the malady at its beginning, and if it is treated according to what we have said in the division; and does not separate nor delay, for you doubt whether the corruption will affect all the diseased area, but yet he has made .v. cauteries on top of the chief: one near the head with a little thickness, another towards the forehead at its end, and two under the ears, and one behind the hamate bone; and let your hand be so that the caustic becomes the bone, and until the sinews are pushed out from it far enough for the large humors' vapours to escape. Caution above the mouse according to what it is before. (This translation extrapolates medieval cauterization practices, which may involve repeated procedures on various body parts in an effort to treat specific ailments or conditions described in the Old French text.)

And you know that the more I do fire cautery, the more help it provides, and he feels better; and you know that the maladies feel no pain from the fire cautery as much as a healthy person does, because the body is already completely rotten. And it is necessary that the fire cautery be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in treating with iron tools. After healing his foot with flour mixed with honey and other treatments until he is healthy again.
This line appears to be incomplete or possibly a fragment from Old French. It translates to "from inflammation" if it were part of a larger context, but without further information, no accurate translation can be provided.
When inflammation does not occur in any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, yet it'e still sick; nevertheless the fire cautery is applied to the limb according to the size of the joint and the smallness or largeness of the limb; then a little bit enters into the deepest painful spot; and after healing with ointments until he is well again. And there has never been an occasion for performing fire cautery on hands, arms, and backs, at the exit point where the nerve causes the limb to become still; and in all cases it is necessary that one must be familiar with the limbs and movements of the moving body.
This line also appears to be incomplete or a fragment from Old French. Without additional context, an accurate translation cannot be provided. If "de albaras" were part of a larger text concerning medieval medicine, it might refer to something related to barley or barley products in treatment practices, but this is speculative without further information.
When the disease called "albaras" is aged and medical expertise proves to be of no value, then with fire cautery only a little bit enters according to the extent of pain; until the blanching of the skin becomes ostee and its color changes; then it is treated with flour mixed several times with lentils, rosemary oil, plantain leaves, and each from colon or swan sanguine, all in one mixture. Then it is moistened with this mixture and wrapped in a linen cloth, or dried on the foot until well again.
The treatment of a chancre by fire cautery involves carefully applying heat to the affected area to promote healing and prevent further spread of infection. However, this practice would not be recommended as modern medical procedures are more effective and less invasive. Fire cautery has largely been replaced by contemporary methods for treating skin lesions like chancres (a type of ulceration usually caused by syphilis).
When a chancre appears at the beginning and you see to arrest it, if with fire cautery one applies what seems like a circle around the entire ulceration; everyone said that they also performed fire cautery in the vicinity of the chancre; however, I do not believe this is better, because I fear it may become an ulcer and corrupt, and I have never seen any such practice before; rather the correct thing seems to be applying fire cautery around the circle with a circular caustic, as we have said in many cases of cauteries.
The treatment for an inflammation that cannot die involves various methods such as medicines and ointments to alleviate pain and promote healing. However, it is essential to consult a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan based on the specific condition of each case.

And if you see it piercing all of the cautery, then the form of this fire cautery is such that:
And place your hand in the midst of that disease called "adubelati" as long as the cautery has pierced the skin, and be such cauteries that the malaise's pain flows in such a manner that it resembles the flow of diarrhea. Afterwards, when healed perfectly by the cure.
the fire cure with iron
Another way of disease is called "corrodens," and it is nothing other than an infestation of limb; for it affects the limbs just like dry fire burns them. If you see this disease in its presence that could suffer cautery together with fire, then you must strike the clavicles very lightly and strongly according to what the point or the disease requires at that moment; after caustering all of it until no trace remains of it, such that everything that is corroded should not be left. And afterwards let it stay for three years, and allow the burned areas to heal with oil as long as the fire scars are healed, and then any remaining corruption. After this cure with ointments produced by charcoal; if after three years no healthy limb has regenerated, that is good; but if it does not happen so, then again apply the caustic on such a limb as still remains unhealed. This infestation was never treated in medicine in its presence of cautery with fire; but all caustery with fire is much help and I have already said about the cure for division: take that which you are most skilled at using.
of the stones that come into pieces.
Many times it happens that the stones by fractures bring forth a disease called "clos," according to our understanding, and it is a great harmful thing which breaks the stone itself; the cauterization of this disease is done in two ways. That means caustery with fire, and hot water. Caustery with fire is that you must strike as if you were striking a nail like an arch's keystone, and made of good iron to the measurement it can allow the nail to pierce all by force; afterward, hold the hot nail high over the nail until it begins to move in the place of the stone. Then make a trap of known bitter herbs crushed with rope, let the trap be placed on top of the fracture throughout the night, and when morning comes, pull the nails out, which will be rootless from their roots. Then cure the wound treating it by healing ointment made of charcoal so long as it is healthy again.
And if they are displaced by different forces on their body, and it happens many times in hands and feet, then you must first apply a hot iron cautery; and it is done thus: take an arrow or iron nail or hollow pin, and place it above the nail and below it, that is to say, cover any warts; and place the arrow above so that it penetrates all the way to the root of the nail, and let it find the hot iron well down to the root; and then endure the sick man a little bit of heat treatment for an hour; then leave him as is, and he will regrow all his roots. So do another one after that, until you have treated all those affected by forces on their body, then treat the wounds that cause pain.
The treatment for trembling involves...
If anyone trembles from cold or the quarter fever, or any other cause, it is necessary to perform... four hot iron cauteries on the spine of the back, one between each vertebra; and also one on the abdomen with a scourge, and another on the stomach with an olive cautery; this will make the patient's body shake from the cold-induced illness.
In the presence of prickling blisters... (Note: Given that there is no further context, this translation simply addresses what might be described in medical texts related to such symptoms.)
Whenever blisters appear from different forces on the body or large corrupt materials, it is required to cauterize each part of the blister: one with a delicate iron rod made from pine wood, which points either in fire-holding or along the root of aristologica, or with a lenticular cautery. And never do we cauterize at the beginning when they appear, according to this manner; they cannot grow forward, but are broken apart and become healthy again; however, it is required that such treatment be done after the evacuation of blood.
Whenever the arrow is removed... (Note: This translation is based on a presumed context where 'li artere' could refer to an arrow potentially causing complications that require attention.) Often it happens that great bleeding occurs from the artery removed at the wound near the perforation or incision in the abscess, or at the joint cauterization site, and there are similar occurrences; and it is very unpleasant to experience such a condition.
And in all cases where this occurs for any reason, if you hasten to place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and tighten it much so that the pain is not felt inside your index finger anymore, and no more discharge comes out; then set fire to the venotomy instruments several small and large until they are all red; then do this, or if there is great or little according to the wound and where the arrow is lodged in it, place the cautery on that vein or wherever you hold your index finger, and keep the cautery there so long until the pain is relieved.
And if it jumps when you lower your index finger from the vein and the cautery is extinguished, then quickly take another of the fire cauteries.
And do not stop doing this one after another until the pain is relieved; and be careful that you do not burn the nerve next to it, and prevent other diseases from affecting the affected area; and know that when the artery departs, it cannot well remain seated immediately as long as the artery is large, unless by one of the four methods we have mentioned: or with cautery, or extraction if it has not been treated yet, or strong binding with thread, or medicines applied which can help in restraining bleeding. And it should be tied and tightened regularly.
Who will closely bind the wound with layers of cloth or place things inside it or similar things if there is no benefit in doing so.
And if it does not occur for any reason and there is no medicine present, then you must place your index finger on the vein wound as we have said, and tighten it until the pain is relieved above the wound and above the vein; and do not move the affected area, but let the cold moisture from its head congeal and grow stiff so much that the limb freezes and stops moving; and make inquiries about the cautery and medicine treatments needed for it.
We have told you of this first chapter in which it is said that for every disease the fire or medicine and instruments and causes and stimulations and forms of cauteries are mentioned; I have put this chief chapter in these pages, and now I will go through this chapter to make things clearer and easier.
And so I begin with this, it is said that you must learn from this chapter that in this book there are more dangers and fears than the first cauteries, and for this reason there is greater care needed.
Because in the work of this chapter occurs many times the evacuation of blood from an incision into a vein and puncture stitches, and incision above it, and treatments for wounds, and removal of arrows, and incision on bones; or there is doubt and fear, and so forths.
And I warn you that you should not undertake folly. For many methods come to cures from people who have suffered so severely with their illnesses that they died quickly due to the treatment and the harshness of their sickness, and for these reasons one must beware. And of these individuals I give you sense and say: "Wait, I am watchful"; and the illness is stubborn. You do not need to consent hastily to those who come to your door with this manner; rather, place greater care in your honor than in your suffering, and avoid excessively but cautiously concerning what you are certain of, and from which you have taken advice, and thus use prognostication and indications in the treatment of your ill patients so that their health is transformed into a well-known name; and this will help to achieve good fame, glory, and remembrance.
Oh dear son, our Sovereigns bid you well understanding and fairness, and if you desire the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Or I have ordered this chapter to be discussed in groups, according to what it is about the cautery practitioner, whom I have designated as such a chief by position that you will find more easily those matters for which you are responsible.
And yet full of water
And it comes often to children at birth and when the head of the child is restrained too forcefully; and there has never been a case where it was caused by something that could be repaid or reversed.
And I have never seen this illness in the 50e: "souvent, siens epeveinse :30xgut.
And I saw a child whose knees were wet with water, and his head was bent so that he could not lift it for each day; and he believed so much moisture that he died, and this moisture is gathered above the bone on the soft spot between the keel and the bone; and the extraction work in such a way that the moisture is between the keel and the bone, and the incision is small enough to make an opening near the head; and it should be as long as two of us, until the moisture passes through.
If the moisture is more pronounced, and the incision is larger, make two incisions shaped like a cross, following this form:
And if the moisture is within the bone, and you see the commissures of the overlapping parts on each side, and the water bursts forth when you press it with your hand between them, and this does not please you; then it indicates that you should make three incisions within the head according to this manner:
And after the extraction of the moisture, remove it all with forceps; afterwards I strain out the layers of cotton and powders, and put vinegar and oil, and leave it for five days; then release it, and treat the wound by bandages and ointments, and allow the head to regain strength evenly, and give meat to the patient dried from moisture as much as the limb is strong and healthy.
And another method of incision is to look at the extent of the abscess, and the accumulation of moisture in it; because there has never been one in front nor behind; never one to the right or left. This indicates a unique approach where no specific direction for an incision can be determined due to the nature of the condition presented by the abscess.
Therefore cut the incision open and drain out the accumulated fluid, and do so according to what you can manage; and warn that you should not block off an artery; and watch for bleeding of blood from the wound, so that the patient's painful discharge of moisture and evacuation of excess liquid decreases.
Of course. The text continues with further discussions on medical treatments and procedures in medieval times.
When there is a disease that affects the throat or stomach and it has been longstanding, and traditional medicine does not help at all; instead, treating with cupping comes as relief when it can cover two main arteries. This text discusses an alternative treatment for chronic illnesses where conventional medicines fail to provide relief, suggesting that the use of cupping therapy might offer benefits by targeting key blood vessels associated with pain and discomfort in these conditions.
Therefore, you must make sure that the patient does not cover his head; afterwards rub his neck with a coarse cloth until the arteries become visible, then inflate the patient's neck with a strip of cloth for each side so they are placed on both ears afterwards; then observe whether one or the other ear has been pierced by the abscess. If so, mark them with incisions at the entrance to the ear, and these punctures should be made wide enough on each ear. Then cover them with two small fractures, which are as long as the bone above the head; thus they will heal from the wound inside. This indicates a medical procedure wherein an infection in both ears is treated through incision around the ear canal forearm, taking into consideration that there may be some complication or problem with his moisture and painful dislocation of joints the earl leu li chief estrange coment leu leu.
And if you see, thrust the cautery into the artery and press it above, cutting as I should with a turn of four.
And when the vein is pierced, it constantly shoots out without reaching upwards.
And if the artery does not open upon feeling, it is required that you measure the distance of two turns and then reach in and break the bone; and as it requires for the blood to spurt out, let it be twenty-five cuns, and perhaps a little more or less depending on what the patient can bear, and whether there is replenishment in the artery; then look at the wound: if it remains above the bone without oozing, break off the abscess cavity that accompanies it, treat and suture the wound until it is healed.
For emigration
When there was ancient emigration, and the ague (fever), caused by moisture from tears and heat in the temples, old forests, and similar things, and they were treated with medical methods and various remedies that do not benefit at all; rather than extracting arteries and cauterizing them as we have mentioned.
And the method of extracting them is that it makes his temple hairs grow back and listens to the artery opening in his temple, for it opens well by its beating, and produces few bloodstains unlike any other men who are too cold; if it is repaired, he removes a cloth from his shoulder (possibly referring to bandaging), then rubs the wound with no rough cloth, then warms water over the wound until the artery becomes visibly open again; and take the cautery stick as indicated here:
:gauche en ciethesme duo jeanre le cité aout :n:thumbs of the ce. ounjacourrect itel'soldre lou : 150rne il laisre (itcuiens,tekeu french.
And take the blood from two joints, just a few; and if the artery is large, it must be tied with a strong double silk thread, which no obstacle will prevent in the healing of the wound, and removed slowly as the blood flow; then remove the excess between these two points at that moment, and when you see the patient well, cut down the caustic from the cautery so hard it goes to bone until the joints are separated; and this is the work of the malaise if the patient has no fever and is warm-natured.
And the cautery is an aid to finish the moisture, for this reason it provides greater assistance with the moistures. He must fill the vein with much cotton and place it well upon tents; and when you remove them, treat the cuts dry that cause inflammation and bandages, until he is healthy; and if there is no pain in the artery as you have done your work, hasten to cauterize it by means of a sharp tool, or apply vitriol and strain with your hand so that the vein does not become slackened; and if you do not have this present, place your utensil on the vein until the blood freezes, raise the vein from water cold continuously, and hold it in such a way as to be required; and he who is weaker during artery extraction with this cautery cutting into two parts, but the cuts are well spaced out to guard against excessive heat longer. And when the dressings are too tightly applied, they hold less warmth. And it must have a considerable amount of space between the two knives, and when you pierce through these joints with your hot iron, pressing so hard that it goes into the bone, and remove the vein at those points; and separate them because this caustic is not uniformly applied to all parts by this cautery.
of tears
When the tears from these eyes are coming out of veins beneath the head of the chief, and there is no benefit from medicine made with it; you see the malaise turning purple and its forehead walking as if in pain; and they are held tightly moist, so that hairs from paper-like fibers grow on them, and these papers are heated by the heat of tears, which needs this treatment.
And it is called the "cure contusion," and you do to the patient who has this malady, with their hairs or front ofttime, and one incision as much on his face bypassing above the papers, and from all arteries that are atras, et ceu laurens; et les faints leu quantité .ij.
From the first incision which goes from temple to the second incision; and scrape out all the keur that is between these two holes in every part of this socket beneath the bone, then make another small incision up to the other second one, and then extract this sharp instrument.
If inserted into the first opening, the instrument is called "culter," and it very efficiently cuts both ways; on one side sharply, while on the other side smooth, and this is its form. Position the sharp cutting edge facing towards the keur, and the smooth side towards the bone; let it continue to push until reaching the next incision as long as this opening is continuous up to where the second hole appears; then make another incision in that same position moving upwards to the other opening; and withdraw the blood piece exactly; then place a gauze pad into one of these openings, lining with moistened linen impregnated with oil and honey, and ensure there is no movement at the abscess head; and after three days reposition the drainage tube, and treat it with alkaline soap water, and other therapies for treating wounds until healing.
To remove any remaining debris or clots, gently irrigate the incision site with saline solution or clean water to ensure thorough cleansing and promote optimal healing conditions. This step is crucial for preventing infection and ensuring that only healthy tissue remains after the treatment process has concluded.
If there is no excessive discharge with catarrh that occurs habitually; observe the clots being loose and small in size; blurred vision, and burned papers are also symptoms experienced by the patient; their skin becomes itchy, and they feel a severe pain at the forehead's center. These signs indicate that these materials and catarrh do not originate from numerous bodily excretions but rather as a result of various other conditions and injuries, for which this specific remedy is intended to provide relief.

In a certain way: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of chaff, and make an emplaster; and apply it to these wounds in order to strengthen the skin throughout.
The dislocation of ears
Everything that affects the ears is one of four things: either grains or animals or rocks from the ground, or similar objects as iron or steel if it's sharp like fire, or seed like barley, wheat, and peas; or something flowing such as water or silk and similar items.
When it hurts in the ear or anything else that does not align with the ear, and grows in the ear, then you put the ear to the sun. If you see a stone, if there is no drop of violet oil or sage oil coming out from it, then I treat extraction; and make him force an expulsion; and stoop his nostrils when the expulsions come, and place pieces of linen or wool in his ears; and elevate the ear.
If it jumps up during the extraction, that's good; if not, then I will treat with a small double-pointed pin from a needle; and if it does not jump up by this method, I make an ear catheter and insert the chief of the catheter or peg into the ear canal strongly, so that nothing can come in with the catheter made of soft wax, which we have mentioned before; then do for the treatment, since much times it comes like what we have said. And if it does not jump up in this way, take some gum from a tree and use sparrows to suck out any fluid, using no instrument that is specifically designed for this task, and put cotton inside; then press down on the catheter into the ear canal or something similar, and proceed with treatment. And if it does not jump by all the things that we have said, then hurry to fracture the ear sockets; and spasms of it; and manner of the breakage is as you make a fenditure deep cleavage of it incisions open de la ceinture dextre leu in the ear. And if it is grains that are inside and it swells, then carefully extract it; and if it cannot be drawn out, then prepare a small tubule under this shape:
But do not make this cut on the grain if you think it is moist due to ear moisture, until you have made many such pieces; then draw out the grains subtly and with suction, as we said, so that the extraction process goes smoothly.
In the case when the ear contains moisture due to first coughing fits, then plump the ear with many cotton balls. And place the wet ear on this side or where the water is; if it springs up from that point, it's good. If not, take many small stones according to your finger's length and lightness, and fire them a little bit; and put the patient's cure into one ear, and let his other stones fall on another side of the stone in the ear; and never stop working such stones upon each other until the water is completely expelled from it, and then it springs up fully. If you see any improvement, take a reed, and insert one of its ends into the ear, and burn the other end with fire as much as the reed becomes hard; then make another treatment using other reeds as we have said in the stone in the ear.
In the extraction of the best, if it is small and similar to other things, treat it as we have described in the division; but if it is large enough to be felt, then prepare an extraction with pinchings; because that process is easier to remove from the ear.
In the extraction of ingrown hairs in the ears, if you have such care as we described in the division and how to treat distillations; because that care doesn't benefit at all, it is necessary for you to look into the ear with the sunlight: if there are no ingrown hairs, then extract them subtly with pinchings, and if there aren't any either, then take the thread of copper in this form.
And make it both narrow and wide above. Then pour the more subtle chief into the ear according to the quantity of suffering in the patient's malady; then form a small cotton ball with that thread as we have said in the pore; do this often until all the hairs come out. If they don't come out, pull out the cotton inside the porous cloth like I have described in the ear; and if they don't emerge either, then prepare distillations that the old ones have tried with cutting worms, and you will find them or treat them with distillations; and if you draw oils and medicines into the ear using all this instrument as shown here:

Of the dislocation of ears
No child is born with ears punctured; and this same thing happens to men through ear dislocation from a wound or an injury in the ear, and such dislocations never occur within the ear unless one can see it well; and there is no case where only a little time passes before they see clearly again.
Those who suffer such dislocations and cannot be seen are afflicted with various treatments, and it is therein that you must put the malady ear in the sun; and look within: if one observes an obvious operation, this work consists entirely of the space described here:
And it should be stretched and pulled both forward and backward, provided it does not bleed the ear; if the operation is due to an ear tumor or bone fragment in the ear, you must pull it delicately and lightly, so that those fragments are whole bones.
And if the operations are performed in the ear, take a delicate knife and shave a little fire on it; then put back the bone fragment of the ear. If you feel the malady sensation when hearing from such operation, proceed gently, and ensure that you do not press too hard on the nerves within the ear; then place in the ear a tent according to the size of the puncture, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment.
Do this for no longer than the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it with rose water, and sprinkle vitriol powder on it; and if you see blood in the ear, cover the tent again and move another molded tent made of oil roses and beeswax until the bleeding stops; then cure the wound as long as it is healing.
And if it is blood that comes forth, plunge an absorbent sponge and wrap in cold water, and place on the ear, and apply other treatments for which there exists a flow of blood, whether they are used to treat distillations.
Of paper sheets
This paper model that comes with the hairs when they are moist and dry contains instructions to extend them with tweezers and pinches, and coat it with a lead ball's root; then place it on the wet wax.
And if without decortication, the subtle lunate cautery is used underneayer and afterwards it moves; and many times they repair for no longer than their roots remain unchanged; and when the roots are cauterized with fire, those roots burn away and do not return.
Of the clay
Many times come on paper things that appear like clay in shape and hardness, which is why this disease is called "great hail," a large conglomeration of moisture heavy above and below the paper; the work involved includes guarding against the great hail to see it move from one side and another easily, then scrapes off each part lightly, takes with pincers, and coats. If you do not cover her with a small coin sensibly at first glance, nothing wrongs the patient; if the fissure is large, she puts on an assemblage of stitching until it heals; and if it's small, no force should be applied, as ointments restore her almost immediately.
And if the hail is inward towards the ear toward above part, turn the paper over, and pinch the hail; coat it and press from one side and another; and if the paper is separated by an incision, nothing wrongs the patient; when the hail has been cooled with salty water, cure the wound of that which inflames so quickly as long as the malady is not healed.
Of the fat of the hairs

And the manner of this work is that the maladies put their chief upon your body; and then take one linen cloth in a way like a circle according to the quantity it contains from each part, and place it on you; and press with both hands at opposite points so that they come together inside the circle; then make an incision into the moisture using a sharp blade, making a wide cut, and do not let it be larger than the wound of a vein opening; and bind the skin around the incision until the exudate comes out in multiple places; and in various arrangements, from the fissure, depending on the shape of a bladder piece.
Extract then with one piece of cloth between your two hands after the cut, and turn your hand both to the right and left until it is dispersed; and make sure you do not push into the fissure so that the whole wound does not heal just at the edge of the incisional line, so as not to bleed.
And if the exudate does not open at the beginning of the fissure, then gently push it further into the fissure until it opens; then extract as we have said before, moisten gauze and bandages in water and place them on the wound, and bind with bending straps.
And if there are such homes that grind grain and place it on top to corrupt the moisture which is delayed; then treat until it becomes healthy again; and if it appears at the apical incision, cauterize with embers soaking them until they become healthy.
of paper hairs
When from papers hairs arise other than their nature and become old, if they harm the hairs, and bring about manners of diseases as is used to be with blisters and swelling of the papers; and it is the cure according to three manners: or by heating together fire, or by using aqueous solution depending on whether it' Written in Old French during the 12th century.
It is necessary that you place the head of the malady in your temple; then turn the paper of oil to your left hand; if it turns, it is good; if not, stick an aguill (needle) at all points above it; and do this either near the edge of the paper or where the hairs grow next to these hairs, and pull a thread across the entire paper, and turn it to the razor; then make in the part underneath the paper, beside the hairs aligned together, from the large margin down to the small one; then draw out the thread, and place under the paper a small tent of cotton and cloth, then sign above the paper an image like that of a mustard seed, whereby all it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity you elevate the paper which is devised for everyone.
And if a section that requires great quantity of the paper according to what the paper is thin; then make in all the space below the lines you have stamped, and one fissure near the natural ends of an axis, then insert the needle into one of these two angles, and scrape it out thoroughly; then assemble the two corners with a thread made of fine wool through every hair throughout; bleeding the sanc (bleeding), and scraping away excessive filaments from all things glued to the teeth; if you do not make this, leave the stitches and threads for three years or more; then cure the wound with non-rigid, constraining things, since the paper revives in the heat of the wound and assembly, but the stitching is a mixture (if as the ancients said), and these are troublesome:
And in another manner: and it is that you mark the paper with a figure as also like to the mustard seed we have told about, for three needles according to the shape which is here:
and take care of these small powers equally according to the shape which is here:
And if you have no force to hold the tweezers and they are not equal, then take an aguill with one thread or it has two threads, and insert them into the figure; and put another thread near the large margin, and another thread near the small margin, and assemble your threads equally between both sides; then treat your hand equally, as we have told you, and treat all that you have stamped on the skin of the wound, so it heals well, if the abscess appears in your incision, then calm it with ointments and soft touches.
And never happens that the hairs of the paper are converted: it is necessary to use what we have said about the incision, but in one and on the other side it is more artificial (unreal).
i:c unan the faire ait lesse:sesuccles, thezè, tolere lice." :victure. Whatime. Ixerimentar.
If it delays, if the hairs have strong forces, then treat it until it is healthy; and when the wound is closed, and lifted the paper, the hair will no longer point; and this is the shape of .ij. cat's claws that you should make according to this figure, and in accordance with this length and width:
The operations are such that you need a subtle needle and a strong silk thread of about the length of one palm; then join the claws together very gently, and make one filament long; then take another fine silk thread lightly, and weave it around both threads; then place the patient's head in your hand so that the operations are declared, because they are subtle and thin operations, then hunt for the entire hair along with its root next to the natural hair, tear it hastily from the paper, and extract the hair up to the weft; then pull out your hand until the hair bears long prongs in the weft along with the original hair.
And if the fil is treated and the hair does not come out with it, you will pull the weft to all the thread that you have ordered, as long as the prongs stick down below and you can see them through the oil's vision; then when you pull the weft and the thread, and leave the oil and the skin for .ij. years or more, so that the hair settles in its place and grows therefrom; and if the hair is small, accompany it with a long strand from natural curls, and align it with the one you let grow, as long as it is twisted and then loosen.
Of oil's diarrhea
When this disease is called "aleacratia" or oil diarrhea comes in the oil, if there are .ij. kinds: one natural and the other unnatural. And it occurs by wounding a wound, by cutting a part, or by cautery, and similar things.
And the way of this procedure is that you fracture the seam, and tear off the lungs from it, and place linen tentacles in there, and make them until they are healthy; and do not need to use anything in the treatment that dries and restrains. Because if you do this, the illness returns worse than the first one; but doing things softening, as with fenugreek; and boiling water or salted linseed soaked, and ointments melted into any oil, and envelop a tent in it, and treat according to that.
And the treasures of your treatment so that you do not let it harden in the shape which we have said form of this disease, which is formed as before; et saché li ténèbree: Et si li poinct du foulteis ains demein dous.

This disease that is truly called "axacrati", and is natural and occurs. The occurrence comes from wounds and openings and cautery and similar things; and the operation in this case you should use a needle, so it has two threads, and the point on the blade rests on the left edge of the board, and cut through the right-hand side of the blade until the thread lies in two points on the surface. Then the board is above all the needle, and the hole is wide to one millimetre.
And if the figure of the paper returns according to what it contains, that's good; if not, then take a razor and place it in the crack, turn the paper, and make .ij. cuts or folds within the paper; and let the tips of those two cuts align at the angles of the incision you have made, and make them so that when they are assembled, the figure is as if it were a letter without the "j. griesche" marking; then attach the piece back according to its size, which shows us how much the paper overlaps, and reattach the misplaced parts with linen thread, and perform this cure that we have described for mild medicines and tents until it is healed.
And if the disease comes from a fissure or seam or cautery, it is required that you make a straight incision along the hairs of the papers; and according to what has been said before; then tear between the .ij. layers of linen as I have described; and the master surgeons apply their inventions in all possible ways so as to return the figure to its natural form, and the patient's own remedies and various other preparations must be carried out according to what this work requires and involves.
Do not sew or fasten the paper in a way that damages it further; instead, treat it gently and carefully to avoid causing additional harm.
When this sewing causes the paper to protrude above the white oil, and it cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must insert the tip of a razor into the paper and lift it; and make pincers so that they are not too tight nor too loose around the subtil spatula underneath, which should be neither too tight nor causing bleeding to the oil. Then reassembled incision is gently smoothed out until the paper returns to its natural form; and it heals completely without any exposure to dirty water or wax, and a damp cloth, and then place linen tape underneath the paper with moistened wool on top of it. After one year use a curry comb and other sutures as long as it remains healthy.
Avoid using water in contact with the oil, whether it's dirty or clean, to prevent any negative effects on the paper and its structure.
Answers:
And the way of cutting is that he places his head in your healthy spot, then does the work with his hands; and let the pincers hold the nail at a small angle, and lift it above; then take an awl, and put on it one hair from a horse, or cow, or bull, and a strong thread; and double the tip of the awl slightly and insert it into the nail, and tie the nail tightly with all its edge, and let the nail stand above, and shave along the side of the nail that encloses the flesh to the hair on the head up to the chief, and handle the remaining part in the small slot underneited and the fine forces, and leave it natural or angle, so that through the incision blood does not flow unnaturally from his body: and sometimes their nails have been cut only with a thread as we have said; then shave off all the soft part of this shape:
And guard that the nail does not touch the soft flesh and break it, and that the prunelet is not seen; after the incision pour a little bit of linen into the oil, and with a crucible made of lead, let it stand for another day; then cure him as much until he becomes healthy.
And if the nail is not nervous, and you cannot push the awl in, and the nails do not allow it, many times this misalignment of a nail has been treated with medicines; and they are born as I have described in the division, and when you see it covered, you treat it with oil for the dislocation following this form:
And lift the nail underneitedly, and if you see that it does not soften at all and the reason presses, then distill from your mouth into the oil crucible made of lead and red copper and linen threads, and let the oil stand for another day; then resume this other work according to this method until it is completely healed.
If nothing is contrary in the oil, as with an abscess, then first heal the abscess until it is healthy, and then resume the work as before, continuing until it is completely healthy.
And if the appearance of flesh around the groove in the oil causes great harm, then suspend it from the nail, and take a piece and not all at once, so that the blood does not flow; then distill into the crucible made of red copper which is filled with lead.
Of the flesh that grows under the eyebrow.
And some people never have red skin under the eyebrow, and binds the eulz to the paper, and sustain the force, and as we have said in this treatise.
llencisque.
But in any case it is necessary that you treat each weakness of the natural pathway; and by accidental means, in work with iron; and do not push your hand into any of these methods until you see that this member suffers from that attempt.
joints of the limbs
These are red veins which are covered over the pathway, and they prevent you from seeing their work all days. The matter is thus that firstly you look at your oil, in this way indeed it is, for there is no other disease more fatal than these; however, one should treat them as follows: instruct the patient to put his head on a clean place, then suspend those veins throughout the entire body according to their intelligence, and be very subtle double-fold concerning this form.
And they should be divided by degrees in one corner following this form:
Then you should apply these veins subtly, and withdraw the blood hour by hour until you see those harmful veins being removed from your oil; and make sure that you do not touch the skin with pointy instruments, and perform this work at noon in front of the sun, so as to be very vigilant during the operation so that only these veins remain; and when you have done this, distill a green-and-red oily mixture to break up what is left behind.
And if you cannot remove everything in that hour, then apply a soothing plaster on the oil to alleviate the pain of the joints, and leave it for any number of days until the pain is relieved and secured from reopening (aposteme chaut), and then resume using this method according to the form presented previously as long as he remains healthy. This refers to a treatment strategy that involves applying medicinal plaster after initial steps have not fully resolved an issue, with the continuation of treatment depending on whether or not further intervention is needed once the condition has stabilized and any pain has subsided.
from the fistula in the oil (assuming 'fistule' refers to a small abnormal passageway that may be associated with medical issues involving fluid leakage, such as an arteriovenous malformation or other vascitatory condition). This would involve addressing the specific problem of this abnormality within the context of the larger treatment plan described.
The more common name for a "fistula" is an "arteriovenous malformation," which refers to the abnormal connection between arteries and veins. According to what I have previously stated, if you treat it with cauterization and hot medication following my earlier instructions, then it is not healed; in that case, you must divide it above the aposteme (presumably referring to a surgical incision site), whereby it will die, and extract all of its moisture. This passage suggests specific interventional techniques for dealing with an arteriovenous malformation or similar condition when standard treatments have failed, involving targeted cauterization followed by careful extraction as part of a more aggressive therapeutic approach.
And when the bone is revealed, and you will see its corruption and blackness, it has this form; and you shall call it "sharp end," and make one piece of it rightly so far as it is in .i. (interpreted herein), and dose it as if with a chaine like the present:
And put on its rotten bone, then turn it between your two hands, and press your hand a little so you know that the corruption is being removed; and do this no more than once, then restore the bone with antiseptic medicines.
If the wound is sewn together, and it does not heal, and the bone of the bow is sewn together, and remains in this state for forty years, and it never renews or becomes abscessed, and there are no accidents coming near it, you know that it is sound; if not, then there is another treatment to return the fistula back into the hernia according to this form: and when you find bone again by iron for the second time, and with medicinal waters, and when it has been found so much as to take .iij. angles, and cut the stone slightly downward as you see here: and fix the shoulder joint at .iij. angles.
Then put on the bone next to the ligament, and move your hand away by a little bit, then turn around at all points of the fracture until you feel the pain in the wound and vein as it presses against its place; and then restore the bone with dry medicines, as I have indicated to you, and when the wound hardens and becomes calloused, that matter flows back into the hernia. This is a lighter treatment for the patient.
From the discharge of oil, which occurs when there is an infection or inflammation causing fluid to seep out from within a wound or joint. This can be indicative of an ongoing issue that may require medical intervention to prevent further complications and promote healing.
When the veins are opened and they do not disrupt or diminish the hernia, then you must lie down on a linen cloth with aloe vera gel and incense and frankincense, and strain the oil, and strap it to bandages thickly so that each is doubled in .iiij. layers, and repeat the suction of the veins using pads hardened leather; then remove the pads and the straps, if you see the oil returning, which is good; otherwise, continue with tightening the dressings and linen cloths and ointment, and when the oil has returned.
There comes a sudden fall of woven fabric
When disruptions occur in the woven fabric, and it tears apart like a grain of resin, making it visible; however, to repair such work is as if you prick at the root of that part above this line, then pierce another thread or double strand thereon; and make an incision, and leave the first needle according to its position; then stretch out the second filament and suture a piece of linen cloth around it tightly, and let it remain until the threads come loose with the vein, then remove the needle and apply softened wax on that thin layer above; and treat the oil with soothing things while the wound heals completely. And sometimes this wound is constrained by the vein in any part of a circle of cloth, as long as it remains unhealed.
And if the threads show a great appearance, then pierce it with subtil spatulas that are formed from oil, correcting the moisture and displacing the threads, and immediately draw out as much as possible; then stretch it until healed completely.
of the blood in the oil
This disease that affects the unmarried (perhaps referring to an epidemic) is not caused by blood in the oil but rather by a substance assembled in the oil, seemingly descending like water; and the manner of appearance of this treatment such as you seat the patient on a raised bed and straightly, then take hold of part .i. of his body with two hands, and keep pressing down until you see blood coming up from below your hands; then pinch it down, so that the light does not escape and separate it off, and observe the patient's conditions as he did formerly; and if it doesn't come out there, show that it is water-like, and since the bleeding hasn’t been addressed according to what we have said. Then seat the patient between your hands, take a small spatula made of soft metal, place it on the corneous skin .i. portion following along with the conjunction continuation on the corona's surface until the blood flows; and when it is released, distill hot honey mixed with honey or fenugreek infusion into warm oil, then treat with other care as long as it heals completely.

After a little rest, and then he raises the second pathway, applies pressure with the instrument, and when it is inserted and does not rise, quickly extracts it by turning around your hand a bit and a bit; and then puts back briefly a silken thread therein, and removes from that oil the fluff inside. Then we put afterwards waxed cloth or soft linen soaked in animal fat, and mix with the clean oil.
And if the silk thread cannot enter into the oil due to its hardness, because it has too many people with hard hairs, it is required that you strengthen the instrument called "alberite", which looks like this:
And then gently pierce it without going too deep, but make it shallow first, and insert the silk thread as we have said; afterward in the patient's good condition, having him lie down on his back in a dark chamber for days, and prevent all movements, and bind lightly with lively meats, so that his head does not move to the right or left side, and tie it according to its natural position throughout the year; then release it into our own obscure room, cleanse his eyes, show him nothing, and after seven days re-insert the thread. It is required that you perform this before starting treatment or immediately after incision now, but it requires that you lift it up quickly because if the head rises hastily.
If the abscess comes out on its own, you should untie the oil before the seventh day, and then address that which softens the abscess; and when it is calmed down, loosen the eye and place it above his face to cover any year, and then immediately go back into our dark room. And then leave a little while in this house, and he returns to his usual condition; and you know that no one should intervene in such cases.
And some came to us from the Yarrick tribe, who told us that in peace they used almagda for piercing, and upon this method the blood would come up, but I have never seen such practice anywhere in our land, nor have I ever read about it in ancient texts; perhaps it is a novel technique.
And these are the forms of the almagda, because those who do not know them see them; and they should be in pure form:
And let the head of this subtlety be: and the base has three angles.

And if there remains anything after that, they will treat it with delicate light strokes, making sure to move nothing; and when the wound does not heal, or if it is on bone, then apply the treatment as it requires; and if it's malignant ulcers, hasten and cauterize so that there are no living parts left inside, then wash with warm water or vinegar.
And if not performed, and moisture then enters the palate, one can see that it is well healed; but if the moisture does not perforate as required, one knows there are dead pieces in the bone above, so they apply a thick linen thread about an inch long, and tie them with our hands at intervals of half an inch or less. And let the patient put their tongue firmly to the thread through his mouth until it feels warm; this is done repeatedly for children at school, which is easy for those who do it. Then hold the chief's head by one hand on top and another hand by the mouth with the other hand in between us, so we know each other afterwards. Do this as long as you know that the nuts have corrupted the piece of bone, then thread the string through the incision, clean off any remaining sinew in Egyptian ointment, and reattach it to the incision as before; do this for three years or more until all pervious remains are corroded by oil applications, and if there is a need for adhesive medicines, then use them; and that's the form of the instrument used for purging the chief.
And whether silver or gold, shaped like an open cannon, and you use it as well; if you see him closing the cage, then apply smooth linen strokes to purge the chief; and hold one hand in front of his head while heating oil or any liquid. This instruction refers to using materials resembling a metal container (like an open cannon) for medical treatments during that time period. The process involves careful observation and intervention, with linen being used as part of the purifying method applied to the patient's chief—a term from Old French meaning head or skull. This treatment would be carried out while a practitioner holds one hand in front of the patient'ayer, possibly to maintain warmth during treatments that involve heating substances like oil.
From the bone above the incision. Here, "char" refers to pieces of dead or calcified tissue within a fracture or open wound where there is bone exposure. The phrase implies that after cleaning and preparing the site through various methods such as ointment application and moisture control, any remaining unhealthy bone matter must be carefully removed from around the incision in order to facilitate proper healing or surgical procedures if necessary. It's a reference to meticulous post-treatment care which is critical for successful outcomes following medieval medical interventions.

when the fingers are cut and discolored
Seal the wound in one of these operation sheets with little profit, since not everyone benefits; then check if the wound is fresh throughout the whole body; and if it's so, open each .ij joint to a seam, and treat them until they are sound; and when their lips are swollen on either side, you must scrape all their corners as long as they heal, then bind the .ij joints with a seam, and sprinkle powder upon powder of dragon blood, and incense; and place a piece of strong or other adhesive under the powders, and let it ooze out by itself, then treat them until they are sound.
The method of the seam is that you assemble it either with needles, as we have mentioned in the abdominal seam; or with thread, as I have told you before.
The incision of the lips
Some homes experience deep incisions on the lips that resemble grains of sand, smaller and more severe; therefore, you must turn the lips around each nostril using pincers and hold them at a joint; then apply oil to each part after the incision with vitriol and let it remain until the flesh is not healed; afterwards treat the lips with lime, and care for the wound until it is sound.
The treatment of gum wounds
Many times the albulus wound is stitched on the gums, which was formerly called "albulus"; it requires that you hold and treat the tooth at its root with pincers, leaving the sinew or flesh intact; then apply vitriol or other drying powders. If the wound returns after incision and does so multiple times, if it's stitched a second time and cauterized again: if it doesn't return after cauterization; these are the forms used to cover such wounds.
Glandular swellings

It requires that when you treat his toothache that you delay the drawing of blood as much as possible, because this is something that should not be done; for it is a very high substance and therefore no excuse can be given for piercing with an arrow. When the toothache is constrained, it requires that you be certain of the decayed tooth. Many times the pain in this condition comes and care must be taken for the healthy tooth; and no matter how much discomfort there may be as long as the disease persists, because we have already seen such cases with these saints; and when you are sure that the decayed tooth is indeed decayed, it requires that you tear out the tooth at every point firmly in order to protect the gum from all parts; then take the tooth very carefully with your tweezers delicately in the first and second positions and so on until it is well extracted, and hold it securely. And place the broken tooth between your teeth well that it does not move.
After extracting the tooth straightly and if it does not break, take none of these instruments and thrust it back from each part lightly, and move it as you have done in the first instance; and if the fragments are perceived and mended, it requires that you fill them with gauze, whether there are fractures or not; and if moved sublimely with tweezers, make sure they do not break when stretching over the gum to avoid dislodging the filling.
And you must take great care that it does not break, and remain a part of the decayed tooth, and bring back to the tooth via the malice of its roots larger pains than before. You must also be careful not to do as ignorant saints have done, who rush headlong and recklessly break nothing ever; yet they nevertheless bring this great disease upon the roots where it lingers, or for the fracture that breaks, which we often want them to come back with; and when the tooth is extracted, cleanse its surface with wine or silk, and if blood clots form, frequently occur, then moisten it with vitriol; and if this does not work, cauterize it.
The forms of instruments, to make sure the fragments do not double when you extract the tooth, should be long and slender points with large handles. These are the shapes:
And make sure they are sturdy enough not to bend during extraction, and be well-made iron instruments for holding firmly while being manipulated; these features ensure durability and safety during the dental procedure. Specifically, the characteristics include:
concerning the root fragments that may remain after a tooth is extracted, which are critical for reattachment or repair procedures: theures siemple : in the iaitre.

And if the roots do not grow out of all these tools, it is necessary that you expose the whole root, and place there the instrument called "althali", which is known as this:
And even if it is thick and strong so that it does not break, and if the root sprouts from there, it is good; but if not, with all instruments you have, they come in forms like this afterwards:
And if you use this instrument that has three points, its form is like this:
and other instruments that are placed before by reason of their density, and this instrument that seems to be large tools, whose forms are like this:
And these tools must not break it, and you know that there are many dense instruments; also other instruments that are not counted; and the skillful master subtly changes his instrument himself according to what its works and diseases show him, because he has various maladies or the old did not teach any instrument for their diversity of location; and if it breaks a tender part or an adjacent bone, or if it protrudes, you seek other instruments that I have told you about, and help with gestures, whose forms are like this: And they should be large and well-fitting to hold the bone so that it does not slip, but allows holding and pressing; then restore the location of medicines suitable for this case, and if there is porriture in the bone and it is small, you use all this instrument:
When the tooth does not align with its natural shape, and the form is ugly, especially in women's teeth, it is necessary that you know the dense is not after the tooth and it is not right; therefore, there can be no filing or polishing on them; but rather the cut (incision), and if it protrudes with the tooth, you take this instrument whose form is like one little beak, and it must be of iron sharpened on both sides:
And the cope is small and often used in strong teeth for a long time because you do not move the others; if it can be polished on that one appearing there, then this abrasive has a part of a little limerick like this form:
And it is also like the abrasive used for making needles; and in polishing that little tooth a bit longer, so that it does not move while it grows; then at the end there is no rasping instrument, and if the dense is too thickened and tears the tongue, it must be rubbed until it becomes even, provided that it does not tear the tongue or corrupt speech:

Of covering the tongue's line
Never has such an affliction come from the tongue or nature itself that we have seen like this; or by accident of sealed wound; and the operations are as follows: you perform on the malicious person's mouth, ensuring your hand is clean, and gently move the tongue until it is dislodged from its place, and if there is difficulty or any other issue, it is due to a sutured injury; ensure that the fissure does not become too large, as it is near the artery; and when you have done so, raise the blood-stained flesh with warm or cold water, or with vinegar, and place a linen cloth over the tongue each night, to prevent the malaise from causing sores. And if discharging of blood comes about, apply vitriol on the wound; and if it does not yield, cauterize with slow lentiginout, which is beneficial for this purpose; then treat with other treatments until it has healed completely.
And if you see blood discharge of any color or blackness or hardness, let the malaise not feel it, as it may be a chancre; and if it is declining to blenching, and has moisture, then crush the nail, and apply an ointment delicately on both sides; and if it does not respond to your treatment, apply vitriol repeatedly until it becomes unadulterated, then return to this operation as long as you treat everything thoroughly. Then raise the skin of silk and sinew, and cure with other treatments until it is healed completely.
Although "des apostèmes de la gorge" does not appear in the text provided, if we consider the context of medieval medical terminology, this phrase could potentially refer to aspirations or abscesses within the throat area:

And if you do not have this instrument, then take the hammer with which it has this shape:
And if the patient is bleeding from one side and breathing from the other; and when you have caught one almond with your tool, then catch the other in the same manner, after making an incision to rinse the patient's hot and moist blood, and cold and dry, until such time that it is unstopped; or if rinsing does not work, cooked quince fruits, or fir cones, or similar things, so long as they remain closed; then perform the cure until he is healthy; and nevertheless other abscesses may appear in the throat besides these two almonds, which are also treated like the two almonds.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that was lodged in her throat, which is to say one small abscess; and she had the entire throat sewn up well enough so that she could not breate through the obstructed passageway, nor eat or drink, and she died if she had remained there for either one year or two. I started immediately, then I inserted a thread into one of the narrowings in her throat; then performed surgerons on these abscesses, and extracted part of it from them, and only came out a little blood; and thus cleared up the blockage in the woman's throat, and she began again to drink water and wine, and I continually dealt with this abscess for long. And then he recurred again, and filled the place that I had opened so much, until it was clear. So, I reinserted a thread therein, and cauterized in her throat: thus, nothing grew worse; and left those parts, and God did with him after me.
of the eye
When the blood flows from the eye, and it swells and elongates, if this is perpendinate [perpendicular]; and if it is large and rounded, then it's called "the eye"; when it is treated as we have described in the division, and this treatment does not benefit at all, and you see that the abscesses are calmed down, and it is delicate; and those which are rounded do not elongate anymore; and whether it is red or has a color of fusia [fusiforme] or black, then you must remove the incision on the eye. For there is great danger for the patient with such condition. Therefore, when you see him, as I have said before, place him facing the sun, press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned earlier; make an incision in the eye and cut it inside, at .i. distances that I mentioned in the incision of the .ij. amandres [amygdalae]; and do not cauterize more than what is superfluous beyond natural limits, for if you cauterize more, it will cause pain to his voice and speech; after the incision, use the method we mentioned in relation to the incision of the .ij. amandres [amygdalae], and let him heal until he is well. And when he has fear or doubt about cauterization, then you must use an engine for the cauterization of pain; and this way of cauterization uses fire water. And by pressing his tongue with the instrument we mentioned earlier, which form we have described:
If it has a hair or head adorned with medication, similar to a spoonful of medication on the eyeball; and let the patient lie down so that saliva and muscles from his mouth collect in the medicine within the eye's cavity, ensuring it does not descend into the throat and bleeding; then place your hand on the medicine and press it onto the eyeball for an hour as long as you can see it is well-applied to reduce discomfort from the medication application. If you observe swelling, take a cotton ball wrapped in linen cloth with this remedy applied, moistening the cotton within the medicine's cavity; and bind it with linen thread, allowing it to dry out of the eye's cavity; then use this method seven or nine days.

Many times the arrow in the throat or spine of a fish, or anything else; therefore you must treat whatever you see, and press the tongue to the sun with all its instrument until you see it move; and if it does not open and is put back into the throat, then you must make vomit the patient so that their meat be cooked in the stomach; perhaps by this way the evil will leave through vomiting; or the malady swallows a piece of sponge, or a slice of navel, or a root of lettuce, or something else; and with the sponge I draw, and then transfer it; and when it comes to the surface, it opens, and you will make it vomit; and if it does not open through this, take an instrument like this:
And if the straws are placed on the chest so that it can more easily enter the throat, and raise the head in height; and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, which will not close or push down into the bone; and move such that the malady expels the instrument because it has been moved or if the thing is pushed out; when it goes upwards, you must make it vomit forcefully, keeping everything in line with the instrument until it comes out.
of the treatment of the throat
Never has medicine been practiced without healing, as I said in the division of remedies; and when it does not benefit at all, then look at the patient's sick mouth towards the sun with the instrument you were told about; and if you see the illness, treat it with a small pinch or use very fine tweezers for that purpose. And if it doesn't work, take a curse upon the sick person's throat, and pour hot iron into their mouth, and fix the iron there by hand, and do so often. And when the sick person's face is covered with water throughout the day, then fill a whole glass of cold water and treat the mouth, and let the saliva flow from the gums to the hands frequently; and if you quickly feel the cold water, it helps.
And if it does not heal as we have described, smear the patient's face with leaden smoke using the instrument I mentioned in uve fumigation; do this many times because they will cry out. The manner of fumigation is that you should pour a pot containing charcoals into which a cover made of fine silk cloth has been woven, and then insert the patient's teeth into it so that their head rests in the opening; then apply the smoke to the face and have the leaden chief placed in the mouth until the smoke does not escape but sticks to the illness; and now the illness will cry out, and if it doesn't heal, repeat the fumigation many times. And let the patient suffer thirst, give them dirty things to eat and drink, and make sure they do not drink water. Ultimately, this is what must be done for that governance.
And the form of the instrument with which we treat the illness is made to look like curved tongs when seen, so that it can be easily moved into the throat; and resembling a bird's bill, and having an abrasive surface, so that whatever she takes in, she cannot loosen. And from this form onwards...
the doctors of the abscesses
Many types of abscesses are mentioned in this book after recalling them from different descriptions; and they differ in perforation and size. It is about two manners of handling these wounds: one resembles my own, because it deals with moisture; and the other manner is for those wounds that lie on the bone, as abscesses have a chief different from the underlying foundation and abscess lesions are distinct from those found at joints. Each practitioner must make judgments based on their own experience in treating these conditions.
dame:esme siens laisseréi sanscez in-12ndedresemain. eslair engeinque thelements le montefie.
And it is necessary that you know the depth of the incision performed according to its completion; and it is when the pain has subsided, and the departure of fever, and diminution of pain and inflammation, and relief in agony, and other signs; and it is necessary that you make the perforation so as much dependent on the incision, and where it opens; and let the deep incision be made along both sides of the nerves, joints or bones, at hands and feet, at articulations and in all similar conditions where there is no deformity.
And in those joints, according to that limb. And when the incision is made inside this flesh, if you leave such perforations until it is completely digested, as we have said; for when you pierce these veins with long incisions, they are filled with blood and foulness; and by accident harden the palate and its underlayer. And if there is no incision of this kind made according to the large grooves, according to what such limbs need. You must prepare small incisions, small openings; and many holes as pertains to the appearance of the thickness of the incision; and when it is necessary that you cleanse with oil or cover it, when it has become as soft like a rag, and if made according to abscesses, and those whose angles are three, and those which resemble the bellows of sulfur, and as for lancets used on angers. And if there are such incisions where they make a rounded cut, and other shapes and cleansings that cover them like bellows.
And those which do not have a chief, as shall be superficial lancets, you must make them lightly; and when the incision is large and has grown thick, you must pierce it with one part; then trim the incisions on both sides within two days, so that the thorny growth disappears completely. This will prevent any unexpected bleeding of the thorns, which may cause death to a weak person or pregnant woman, children, or old people with many bones. Avoid this chapter carefully and when you have made your incision, examine the wound; if it is a simple cut, dress the wound with linen or fine cotton; but if there are large incisions and numerous holes in them, you must stitch each one separately so that they overlap: And if part of the thorny growth has been pierced through the incision, and if it has been pulled back, then fill it with clean linen or lint-rags, moistened; let a physician or nurse dress it for two days.
xice delevelve:
And this requires that it be known everywhere in treating abscesses: which I have told you how one should go before the treatment of abscesses, and now the author.
This phrase does not provide enough context to offer a translation or interpretation. It seems like an incomplete line without a clear meaning related to the medical text previously provided. If more information is available, I'd be happy to assist with translating it into English or providing additional details.
And when the chief wound is small, and it's handled as we have said, there is no doubt that it does not contradict what was mentioned before; and in the treatment of cutting, this procedure is called "entombment," because from its shape it follows afterward, whatever it contains. For if it contains moisture, it proceeds very quickly; and when the moisture is drained, nothing should be left behind in the abscess cavity that could return later on; but those which remain must corrode for not healing within two nights. Then reclaiming the cotton wool, as we have done before, do it again after one more day, and then a third time until you know it does not delay beyond two nights; then treat the abscess with ointment to which it is appropriate, until it heals completely. And if the cut has such a mass in it, apply it according to this form, stretching out many times over it; and place all your treatment on removing from underneath where there is clot. And if that artery becomes contrary, then do as I told you afterward. And also handle the abscess when it's hard, at the incision and the curative procedure in the same way that I have said to you before.
And the treatment of a hard and moist abscess or cut is lighter because it contains little blood. If there are no such abscesses or chiefs that contain moisture, and these were the ones I mentioned from an old woman's body; and found the abscess also like a rough, harsh, and blunt stone, which could not be broken up; and if none had been treated at all, they would have been just as well done as for a bone. As to other abscesses or chiefs that come from the heads of children and ear roots, their overview remains dependent on them for all days, so they can push out any boil; and treat it as necessary.
Skin ulcers are often discussed in medical texts due to their significance in understanding disease processes and healing mechanisms. In the context of medieval medicine or similar historical periods, skin ulcers might be treated with various remedies that could include poultices, herbal concoctions, and other traditional methods aiming at cleanliness, drainage, and protection against infection. However, without further context from a specific text, it is difficult to provide an exact translation or interpretation regarding skin ulcers from this time period. If you have a passage related to skin ulcers that needs to be translated or analyzed, please provide the complete text for a more comprehensive response.

And if you pierce the vein or artery, and it does not allow to work on it, put in the wound vitriol or any other powders that harden blood, and restrain the wound; and let the abscess be soothed and softened until it begins to heal, and then begin to fall off. And when the lumps are crushed, go back to your work, as long as you complete it; then ask if there will remain any small scrophulae, which you should treat and massage them. And if there is a large root of the scrophula in the vein, you do not need to pierce that scrophula at its root, but let it fall by itself, causing no harm; then soak the wound with thick cotton saturated in Egyptian ointment, and treat it.
And if you pierce the entire scrophulae, it is required that you join and hold together the flaps of the wound, then stop any unnecessary delay for the size of the scrophula; it is required to understand how to cover its root and treat it well as we have said. Those scrophulae with superfluous sizes should be pierced openly and they will die; and pierce them in such a way as that which has been described, depending on whether it corrupts what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is thoroughly cleaned, continue to anointing charms, until it heals.
Of scrofula
The ancient ones spoke and talked about the masonry of the throat; but I have never seen such a practice in our land, and it is not what they wrote.
To those who have throat inflammation, it is required that the flap of the throat called "epiglottis" be removed; and we do not help with this, because all the veins and blood vessels of the patient are located in the area where abscesses form in the mouth, or in the throat, or in .ij. lymph nodes. When the disease is in the channel of the vein, it requires covering the epiglottis to avoid the impending death from strangulation.
It requires then, since we want to cut the epiglottis into .iij. or .iiij. circles or a small slit, either between .ij. circles or by the size of the incision made, not in the cardiac region.
and that part of the epiglottis which is cut off without a seam, and the veins are long without an inlet.
And if the master is afraid, it requires extending the membrane of the throat to all corners, then cutting the membrane until it shrinks in the neck; and removing the blood vessels, if you see no signs, and covering the incision as we have said.
and is demonstrated by the rupture of the arterial blood flow in the neck where the vein that was broken lies, and by voice loss.
and leave the wound open a piece.
And when the time has passed without coining (the coin), we doubt strangulation, assemble the two corners of the cut artery, and cover it completely with cloth; then apply remedies that cause a seal to form until he is sound again.
Alas! we do not perform such an act just as long as the throat is entirely covered in frost, and the patient's malady is judged dead, and his defect remains unchanged. And we cover the epiglottis for the reason that the patient cannot expel air through it, and he breathes through the wound, and in this way is preserved from death.
and for this reason they command leave the wound open as long as the illness of the disease has passed, either in three years or in four years. But they command to stitch the wound and heal it until it is cured.
And I will tell you what I have seen. I saw that one woman took an iron and pierced her throat, and she cut the veins of the patient's body.
And I sawyer veins de lache (sengin ceus siens d'apres.

I rested, and healed the wound, and did so until it was sound.
And there was no effect on the maiden until her voice reddened, and then returned to its natural state.
For this reason I say there is no fear in shaping the epiglottis.
from the large throat
These abscesses are called "throat hernias", and they are large ones in the color of jet, and quite common among women.
And according to various methods: natural or accidental; it has no design.
And the accident is according to various methods: one resembles our flesh, and the other like an abscess that comes from us from an artery. And he had no fear, and did not need to perform bloodletting on every small hole but in that which is inside; he tried and investigated everything related to the internal. if you treat it as one does with our flesh, and it doesn't respond to any voice, then let it heal itself like we do, and let it recover its entire form, whether there is something or not. And investigate thoroughly everything, and treat it as required until it is perfectly healthy again.
as us
Many methods of ours are, which I will describe all resemblances;
And it is required for me to explain all the differences between us and outflow;
I state that the outflow is heat and fever which persists without ceasing to boil, but it performs its function, yet leaves the fever and heat alone.

It requires, when you come to the treatment of the shoulder joint, that you examine and first reset all instruments called "dislocation" according to what the form will be as determined by the chapter following this one.
And the way of examining abscesses in our practice is that you moisten it more than when you pierce it, and turn your tools gently back and forth until you know whether the patient feels pain, then according to the size of the abscess.
Then extract the dislocation instrument, and make sure it is tightened.
If mold moves rapidly, then its color will change, just as I have said about other abscesses.
And after the dislocation instrument does not move due to moisture, you will know that it is swollen, then turn it in a cross shape and take it with pincers, and scrape lightly from one side and hold the joint so that you can remove it safely with the shoulder.
And if you cannot remove it safely, then take it in pieces without leaving anything behind.
For if there is any left behind, our patients come to us many times.
And if it remains for a little while, and does not bother you, then treat the wound with some corrosive pills or caustic waters, dress the abscess, apply soothing compresses to it, and care for other cures until he is healthy.
And if the wound is large, you must remove up to two-thirds of its edges, and treat it with whatever it requires.
And if the vein is against it or something else, and you hasten to use borax solution and leave two-thirds of its edge for a year or three years until the blood clots, then rest the bleeding blood; then return to cover that which has remained.
Here are the forms of dislocation instruments, and they have three types: large and small, and there are also 20 called "albaret", and another one is called "breb", and there are also three types: large, medium, and small, to search for abscesses with fistula.
And they are also similar to the needles used for exorcising witches, and they are made of gold, iron, or silver, and move as those that are yellowish-white, but they are better suited to search for abscesses with black cavities.
And there are three types: large, medium, and small, according to the extent of the swelling.
The forms of the needles are similar in appearance, just as you see here: large, medium, and small; and if there are needles with 20 cavities made in three different sizes.
And if there are needles with 20 cavities and three types; and if there are needles with a single hole and are of three types; and all these are necessary in their length.
The chief of these are sharp, and some who do not cut into one side for this. And incises the nerve.

And they consist of three kinds: great, small, and slight, as you see.
And there is none used but in its natural place, as for legs, arms, breasts, and groins, and likewise.
And there has been made but one other instrument small, seeming to be the scrapers of fistulas, according to this form, and so removed flesh.
And it has not been placed in the healthy place of veins, and arteries, and never according to this great form.
There has been no inflammation of the breasts in anyone when those begin to become corrupt, as they seem like a woman's breasts.
And remain ugly and swollen, and who attempts to cure them, they must be shaped according to this form B of this line up to the letter g. Then scrape off fat, and apply the wound with herbal remedinasions tightly wrapped, then join together the two sides of the wound to heal it completely.
And if the male breast grows downwards due to its size like what happens with women, it is made into two sections above by similar cuts. So that one holds to the other at the end of each and together they contain the smaller according to this form C from line B up to letter g. Then scrape off the skin between the two sections and remove any fat, and we will provide what we have mentioned about stitching and powders, as well as what is necessary for healing until it becomes completely healthy.
And if it is not healthy or the incision is not fully made, because the painful parts do not rest, or due to the discharge of blood, then you must fill the wound with soft cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment. And let it remain while menstruating and the residue of fat, then cure until it is completely healthy.
From abscesses on arrows
These abscesses that come from the arrows are hard manipulations or have hernias, and if there is any moisture in them.
Therefore, those containing moisture must be treated according to this form D from line B up to letter g: And when the entire bog in the abscess is drained, fill the wound with soft cotton and leave it for another day, remove all the cotton afterwards, and then treat the ointment-soaked cotton until it becomes completely healthy.
And if the abscesses are of similar shapes as we have mentioned in cuts on ulcers, and if there is a bog, then treat it with caution as we have said before.
But there is no procedure of the arteries, if one were to do it.

Therefore it requires the iron treatment, and he who is at the head must also do so, and in that one with an artery inflamed above for a long time.
Therefore it requires the iron treatment, and he who is at the head must also do so, and in that one with an artery inflamed above for a long time. then work on the thighs, and repeatedly pull out the arteries until they are exposed;
then place one there, and pierce it on the other side, and hold the artery tight with a double thread in two places, according to what I have instructed you about pulling out the two arteries that are in the temples.
then mark the joint between the two locks of an intermuscularly so that it does not move while you dislocate the incision;
then administer the treatment that is necessary for weakening, until the ligament tightens. and treat this wound so that it becomes healthy;
and if the dislocation is due to the size of the vein, then it requires that you tie with your hand what you can do from the incision in all the skin; then place one there in the joint where you hold with your hand, and pierce it, and tie a double thread so that you can pull it out from the other side. then bind the dislocation, as I have told you, or the ligament of one part with two parts of the joints;
and if you doubt that the thread will not be enough, then wrap another needle all around the dislocation at the incision of the first needle, and tie the threads in four places.
then pull out the dislocation as much as necessary, and handle the excess that prevents healing and leave what has been tied.
then cover it with a linen cloth soaked in wine and oil, and administer the treatments of bandages and wound-dressings until it becomes healthy.
dislocations of joints.
Also, when the dislocations occur in the artery and vein or because of excessive work, or similar things, they happen to the joints that are twisted;
And this often happens in the accessories and limbs or where there are joints, and it is called that painful dislocation, and its color resembles the color of blood, and it is in various other conditions.
and when they pull out, if they feel severe pain, and not all the way through to the core, but rather in front of it.
and it is silent in all parts, neither going forth nor backward, and the one who is at the joints does not need to be covered with iron by any chance: perhaps they have contracted.
And those who are head or forehead, thrust the skin to the stomach. If his incision is small, and you have some forceps, then grasp it at its root.
And if it is large, then he stretches the incision and scrapes it; afterwards, he sets the bone in place with the wound closed until it has healed.
Of large bones hanging There has never been found in the belly and not elsewhere thelul, and it is a disease called 'fungus' by its appearance of warts, which has subtle roots and large veins, and it also has some small and many great ones.
And I saw. i.e., in this home there were .ij. or ventricles which were more similar to funguses than anything else, and they had no difference, and were white; and they had a thin root, and were split, and again became dislocated by moisture.
I collected them and found in the one .xviij. ounces weighing, and in the other .vj., and the works on the incision so that if you look at the maladies they are moist, and the color of the artelul is blanchish and moist and has a subtle root;
If the cut is large, and you are present with the cautery to it. For at the time of surgery many times too great quantities of blood flow out from the wound, and if it does not stop by itself, then quickly come now that I have a big cauterizer;
And if you see the malady and fear of the incision in the iron, take .i. long strip well made, and bind it to the artelul as we have said, and let it stay for .ij. years;
And then the restraint, and never to stop pulling the thread of flesh until it covers the artery, and it hurts by means of work; and if the roots are thick, there is no fear in covering them immediately for the abdomen, but you can also cover most of it.
Then you cauterize so it does not recede; then treat the wound and ensure that you do not cover the vein which is of fine thread, poor feeling, and light color.
For it is an incision infected, and I will come for the treatment of this sore afterward.
when the blood boils for
If the appearance of boiling blood comes from a wound or fissure on the side, and it is in the abdomen and elsewhere in certain body parts, as happens with bone that cuts veins or arteries according to what is presented before, or visceral inflammation;
And if it is through the fissure and its discharge of blood, then the appearance of the incision has colors similar to those of the corpse, and it is a light thing in terms of pain, and opens in various ways. And if it is from the intestine's discharge, then it can be more diverse; and when pressed at its points, it returns, and perhaps becomes scarred, and enlarges much at the entrance to the bath and for great labor.
And if it is due to moisture, it's a light thing, and opens well when pressed with your hand, without constraint; and if it is from blood, it opens by these signs of large and hard incision, depending on the quantity.
And if it is due to visceral inflammation, it is swollen at the extremities, and in such cases you must observe whether its appearance comes from blood of an artery, or vein, or visceral inflammation. It is necessary that you leave the treatment. Because there is doubt and fear as I told you about treating arteries and veins.
And if its appearance is from the intestines or the bowel, it is necessary to command the patient that he tints his armpit, and extends all around it, then covering the entire boiling. then command him to sit still between your hands. then goes through the entire skin that you marked therein. ite: " Thegustrailite thekes duoise in thisesuelements acheve it isueleu thete,se'sainstire. ousé meanwhile, andaitilitage frommeillementaire theilice theil :vithiune ofscape.

Then work on the part of the incision extended over the bandage, and apply your treatment indicator, and treat the intestines. If you tighten the bandage too much, it may slip off and push the intestines towards the back of the abdomen.
And if you tighten the bandage around the wound, it may become inflamed and cause excessive swelling.
And if the arrow pierces you or lodges in your vein, then return to your work and take a few needles and threads, and bind the wound with sturdy material, and insert more needles within it, assuming that you have already made an incision.
Then stretch the incision over four needles, and if you see that they have fallen out, remove them gently, leaving the wound intact until it begins to close, and suture the dead tissue yourself. Or you must cover it when it is slightly raised and appears to be in need of treatment, then perform the necessary procedures on this matter as we have discussed.
Or you must cover it when it is slightly raised and appears to be in need of treatment, then perform the necessary procedures on this matter as we have discussed. Extract the blood or exudate you have applied if it is necessary to do so, then treat the wound accordingly and sew it up.
And cure the ulcer.
We have mentioned the divisions of ulcers in this text, and commented on how one should treat them with medicines, and discussed caution in treating iron cautery; we said that when a chancre penetrates into the marrow, there is great danger in its treatment, as the ancient doctors said when a chancle is in the flesh or can be scraped like a lesion in the skin, and at the beginning of its formation. And when it becomes large and old, one should not approach it, because no one has ever healed such wounds before me.

Believe the patient lying on their hands, and the minister presses the abdomen hanging the water to the lowest part of it; then take the sponge-like spinach according to this shape: And be twisted by two parts from point to edge, and not at all enter so that it can go into the intestine when you stick it in, and do not let it bleed.
Then look if the ulcer is directed towards the intestines: it must be cut in such a way that you make two straight cuts on each side of the hand; and if the ulcer is due to liver disease, then your cut will be on the left side of the hand at three fingers' distance; and if it is related to diarrhea, then the cut should be on the right side. And there is no need for fear that the excess substances flow through the wound onto the weaker area.
Then cut through the skin with the instrument, and open it; hold your hand over the sponge-like substance between the skin and the sinew as much as in scraping about one-third of its length. Continue to pierce the sinus until the sponge-like part becomes visible at eight points above water level; then proceed with the work, using this tool shaped like a small silver coin or alchemical lead ingot: And it is similar to a needle made of silver or tin, and in one section there's one puncture of about three-quarters; and on another side two; and on yet another side one. Carve the incision as you would for cutting like a feather, which is how medieval writers depicted such an incision:
At the top of this area is the alemon, meaning it's where the blood vessels are located. When you touch them with the instrument, they may begin to bleed immediately, and if so, remove that much or just a third of it because if too much is taken away at once, there's a risk that he might die due to the resolution of his spirit from the weapon' transforming into palms, or approaching death.

of the dislocation of the vein Never are there born who do not have an opening in the vein, or if they do, it is small and not properly located. If he must at once prove that it exists anywhere within these four spaces: then place a very thin thread there, and bind it tightly to such extent for either three or four years; and when he feels like urinating, let him cut the loop, allow the liquid, and then re-bind it; and by chance they cannot prove anything, as the urine that comes out does not leave a closed passage. If the small opening in the vein is treated with a thin layer of plaster as we have previously mentioned, it will expand; those who do not have an opening in their veins are covered in wax because no one is born with such an opening at the top of the vein - for they cannot urinate unless they bind their vein to the head; and since the material does not reach down to where it needs to go, this is a serious illness.
And the way of this work is that it causes great pain in their backs; the head and neck are as thick as a penny's tip, if the opening in the vein expands in its place; and do not allow any blood that comes out to flow into other parts of the body many times, and if it occurs, wash this wound well until healed.
Pustules on the vein: The text may be referring to an abnormality where there are blister-like formations (pustules) present around the venous opening, which could indicate inflammation or infection as a secondary consequence of the treatment method. These pustules would require careful management to prevent further complications and ensure proper healing of the vein after surgical intervention. Many times they come with an albathe in the vein, and it appears to be a hideous scar; and there are both malignant and non-malignant ones; you must take care of each one by treating them individually: cover and bind them well, then apply cotton soaked in Egyptian oil and let the treatment continue until they heal. n:cest apein itt heuranflesse.
And when the blood comes, prepare the lunar cautery according to this form: The cauteries help in two things - firstly, during the flow of blood and secondly, its decay; and if the head of the stick is corrupt and retracted, it requires you to cut off a piece of bark from the stick and urinate around the patient's groin area; and when the hair at the top of the stick comes out from where they had not been shaved before circumcision, or for wounds or incision, then it is necessary that you scrape with a tool covered in hair until the ligaments are loosened, and free all the hairs attached to the sticks.
And if it is a difficult matter to devise this thing, then it requires you to scrape with no knife at the head of the stick and its tip; then cleanly separate between them, and place a soft linen cloth soaked in cold water on top without pressing down directly.
Regarding circumcision
Circumcision is not burdensome if compared to other wounds; all else, as we make this work of our volition, and particularly the children, it is fitting that we perform the better work and with greater ease for salvation.
I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision of their children in their laws, because they do not practice it as part of their law, and we have only what we have acquired through experience.
Because I wish for the greatest part of masters and saints who performed circumcision by this method, and its forces, and all around; if it were true that it caused harm because they used two pieces of fabric, and perhaps some would try to cover up the consequences afterward.
Or recovery is done, and the pain doubles, and in the purification process that was performed on the point of the limb it is not assured; and with the purification of an ulcer by chance happens to cut the steel and spoil their work, and many times are born therefrom without any need for this type of cleansing.
Of the reduction made to all of the body's sinews I have found the benefit of the experiment, for the forces cut exactly as above so.
When you press your hand so that each tendon is cut equally in one whole; but the sinew must be well stretched inside the skin of the body; and do it in such a way as to make the child think, if he understands, that you are not just binding the thread around the limb, but forcing him into all possible ways. Then it is done entirely in your hands straight away, and push the forces into your hands or among your fingers so that the child does not see them, nor any other animals' parts; then put your hand on the limb and blow upon it, lifting it up as long as the shoulder joint of the limb becomes. Then clean well from the dirt that is assembled there, then tie the sinew knot with a double thread, then between one and another tie; and hold in the second tying at the puppet's belly button and at its index finger, and keep between the .ij. ties, lift up quickly above hastily, and lead the head of the limb.
Then it is done entirely in your hands straight away, and push the forces into your hands or among your fingers so that the child does not see them, nor any other animals' parts; then put your hand on the limb and blow upon it, lifting it up as long as the shoulder joint of the limb becomes. Then clean well from the dirt that is assembled there, then tie the sinew knot with a double thread, then between one and another tie; and hold in the second tying at the puppet's belly button and at its index finger, and keep between the .ij. ties, lift up quickly above hastily, and lead the head of the limb. Then let the wound be patched up a little bit and a little bit, for it is its nature; and put powder on top of it and on top of the powder lay a piece of cloth soaked in boiled water half roasted with rosewater, cured with good olive oil and fresh herbs, and let it be treated again another day, and heal with other treatments as long as it is healthy.
The form in which the forces are bound during reduction if it is this: the two shoulders held and stretched as much as the arm.
The error of reduction if it is when the blood flows between them at the incision; therefore, you must extend your one to make the wound appear smooth, and do so equally, and if you cannot hold it in place with one hand, then take pliers, and so on.
And if they have passed three years, and what is on the limb is inflamed, let it be kept until the wounds are smoothed out by stretching, and scrape gently; if you pull so as you can, and keep away from the part of the limb, this will not harm nor injure.
Treat now the joint of things with powder for pains that we have mentioned or treated in our treatises, and if he pulls out beyond measure, it goes above, without harming; cure him thus as we have said, so long as he is healthy.
Holding back of urine
The holding back of urine may be due to the operation on a wound, or from frozen blood, or from bowel inflammation, or from similar things as we have said in this section.
And if the urine does not flow out, and you see that the retention is due to the wound at the site of the urethra or neck of the bladder, it must be that the patient's belly is pressed against his thighs; and place their foot on their back, extend their abdomen from above the spine, and restrain them as much as possible; and consequently constrain the neck of the bladder to express through the wound above, so that the urine can flow out.
And if it does not come out, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must assist in extracting all the instrument called "syringe," for so is its shape: be made of thin silver wire lightly beaten like a bird's quill; or may be long and half-palm thick, or fine at the tip.
And the manner of the urine flow is that you take one doubled thread and tie a little piece of wool or cloth at its head, and push the head inside the syringe; then expel the excess of wool and push it also to the top of the syringe, then oil the syringe with linseed oil or lard and bead the patient on one seat, and raise the bladder and urethra in moist linseed oil and olive oil.
Then quickly insert the syringe into the penis, so that it reaches to the root of the penis, then doubled the penis above the bulb; then push the syringe in front of the bladder, and feel the patient's pain coming from the emptied thing, and this is not done according to this order because where you insert the syringe leads it turns; then tie a little piece of wool at all the thread and little piece, and the urine follows the wool, then withdraw the syringe, and let the urine out.
And repeat the syringe as long as the bladder is empty, and tie the patient's limbs.
Diseases of the bladder.
When abscesses or blood come into the bladder, and you see that it is assembled with fluids and medications, then apply all the instrument called "clypse" to its shape: for so is its form.
It is closed, and if it has three holes: three on one side, and one on the other, as you see; and the leeches' thread in such a way that they press well against the penis so that fluids can be withdrawn from the moisture, and push out when necessary.
And when you see the medicines flowing into the bladder, place the capillary in the moisture, and pull out whoever is inside; if you will draw out the moisture, and it will come to the bladder now, and the patient feels pain.
From this time, on senges aingleurs de rire. On the sanc eau leger:esme d'enclichsane desusi itin ties ofr leis desires.
And it is of silver or copper, and the joints are higher; then take a sheep's bladder and place therein the moisture which you see for cleansing that bladder, then insert the bladder between two breasts forming with a fine thread double stranded, and heat it once on the fire; then pour the chief of the washing in the vein quickly, then pull your hand tightly over the moisture surrounding the bladder until the painful joint feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
And if you do not have the bladder, take a piece of parchment and make .i. circle in it, and pierce roundly therein; then insert a strong thread into these holes, then assemble as one assembles for the joint, and place within that what you see with moisture and water and oil, and tie it in the instrument; and do as with the bladder to press with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
And of the piercing.
We have said in the division of piercing methods and extracting medicines; I have mentioned the difference between joint puncture as rain, and all signs, and how to work on a punctured joint; and for the bladder, the vein, and the wrist; and I will tell you clearly and concisely.
I say that the joint punctured in the bladder occurs more often in children, and it is a sign that the water seep from the bladder somewhat like water in subtlety; and the painful finger hurts greatly, and pulls many times, and then increases; and for many of these leaks there are foundings; and the treatment of children until they are three years old is light, and it is very painful for those who are between young age and old age; and cure is lighter for those with a large puncture than for those with a small one.
And when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to purify the patient with cautery for cleansing, so that all the fluids can be drawn from the intestines. Because it has never been required to search the joint.
Then take the patient by the arms, and hold them down and move him or her away from you, if the joint falls to the bottom of the bladder, and it has never been high above. Make it sit between your hands, and place your hands on their thighs so that the bladder is descending all around; then pull out with his hand, and touch those places.

And he commands the minister to press the bladder with his hand, and he orders him to extend it in his right hand above the joints at the top, and in his left hand to grasp the skin surrounding those joints where they make the cut; then he pours the cautery onto that area, so it takes this form:
And it is made between the joints and the foundation, not on the left side of the moisture, and should be placed above the wound, and you must put either directly over the bone or the foundation, and it should have a wide bottom if possible, and narrow in the middle according to the size of the wound, but not too large.
For example if the press must be on the foundation or bone, it should jump in work; and you know that there is a part of the wound or angles and margins: if these are tight to remove; and when the part is inside, they resemble a furrow, and rounded, where the discharge is light.
So if there are angles and margins, make the cut larger; and if it does not jump, you must extract with tongs that are similar to a grinder on the head, in order to pull out the wound so it doesn't close; or you pour under such an instrument subtle, rounded, at its tip. Or if you cannot insert it into this one point, then enlarge that small puncture, and if there is no bone removed, extract with vitriol;
And if there is more than one wound, first pour the largest at the base of the bladder, then continue to pour in, and do it strongly, and the small ones afterwards if there are more. And if it is very large, you must soak with cloths, and make a larger cut. This happens to the patient: either he dies, or his urine comes out by that which cannot be joined together; but in any case, strive to extract the wound or debris using tongs or pliers, until it is removed in pieces.
And when you have completed your work, apply the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and extraction, and cover it with a moistened cloth or sheet made of oil and wine, or water mixed with rosewater and cold water, to alleviate the abscess. Then revive the patient on his bladder, and do not loosen the bandage until after three days.
And when you loosen the bandage, if it has been well moistened with oil and water, then treat the patient with ointment of lime and calendula so that he becomes healthy again.
And if the abscess forms in the wound and deposits of blood in the bladder, and it is retained with urine coming through it in a way that without jumping out with the urine: pours your treatment into the wound, and extract the clot. For if it remains, it will corrode the bladder, and cause the stone to form.
Then raise the wound with alum and salt and silk, and help in all ways that you know, so long as he is healthy; and it is required that all the herbs you treat those legs.

Take fire from iron according to this form, and make it at three-angled points on one stick:
Then take a thin wire around the vein on this side of the wound, so that it cannot run into the bladder; then thrust the iron in the vein lightly, until it moves within the wound; and turn back the iron with your hand in the wound, little by little, until you can penetrate the other side of the wound. If at once urine flows, then press your hand on that part which is delayed near the vein inside the wire. If first it breaks, and jumps with the urine, and its pain subsides significantly:
And if you cannot do this for any reason that it prevents, then take a wire around the wound and another above it; make the stick at the place of the wound between the two points of entry, thrust the stick firmly, loosen one point, and melt the frozen blood in the wound until it is healed.
from a woman's wound
Little occurs when a womb is violated in women, and if it does occur at all, then the treatment is severe, and there are three defenses: one of them being that by chance she may be virginal; and the second is that finding a woman who discloses herself before men, especially as a married woman, becomes extremely difficult.
And the third way is that by chance one may not find a woman adept in this art of hands; and the fourth way is that a wound on a woman's body can be more painful than one on a man's body, because it requires making deeper incisions, which causes great fear.
And if it is necessary that you choose a woman who knows this well, and bind her to obedience; but if you cannot find such a sly married woman, then let there be no shame in seeking an experienced young lady of life or a woman who knows part of the art, and command her to do what you order for the examination of the wound.
And observe carefully if the woman is virgin: then it requires him to insert his tool or foundation and examine the wound; and if she obeys, he constrains her around her foundation, and recommends that she inserts her tool into the wound or along with the malady, and presses her left hand on the full bladder.
And if she inserts it, then he must move her tool from the entrance of the bladder to the root of the thigh continuously until it moves within the root of the thigh against the membrane where it is moving; and push on that part in the thigh'ayer where the movement occurs, and feel the wound in that area. And do not move her tool above or below the wound, but shape it at first small size.
And then thrust the iron in the cut, so that it can emerge from the wound; and see which are many types of pikes: namely small and large, sharp, thick and long, rounded, heavy and with hairs. So you can understand the outcome.

Hernia carnosus
The mixture of moisture or white sap that is within the skin where it retains the juices, and they are called "white sap," and sometimes it's not properly in the membrane of the fat, if we consider this to be something else; and it's the hide between the white sap that we have mentioned before, and such a thing does not happen very often.
And the formation of this mixture is due to a weakness that causes the juices, and it expands that material.
And it never comes from impact on the juices, and this white sap has many shades: either its color changes to yellowish, or it's without redness, or black, or blue-white, and such a thing happens more often.
And this is the sign of knowing that assembly, because if it's the white sap we have mentioned before, then it indicates abscesses, little by little like an egg, and it does not open up the juices at all, because it has complete moisture inside.
And if it has moisture in its own membrane, then it signifies abscesses with a portion of the flesh, and for this reason, they consider it to be another procedure. This statement indicates that when there is inherent moisture within the tissue used as suture material, which could potentially harbor an abscess or other pathology, it may necessitate additional surgical intervention beyond simple hernia repair. Such a scenario underscores the importance of thorough preoperative evaluation and preparation to ensure that only uncontaminated, sterile materials are utilized for suturing during herniorrhaphy procedures.
and if the moisture is between the hide of the juices and the white sap, then it feels well; therefore, as you know the color of the moisture, wherever it may be within the entire surgical field, its shape appears to be such herein described. This portion suggests that when suture materials exhibit inherent characteristics indicative of a particular level of quality or texture and strength, which is beneficial for hernia repair surgeres. The white sap in this context can represent an adhesive qualities between the material's protective layer and its internal moisture. Thus, understanding of color provides insight into the suture's integrity within surgical intervention—the presence of such substance: or it is a sign of fiere de la taille in hernie carnoiseit ouiouneu, si queinon nef Vefort, dese, le sloatment quatorceu theoune tounpremier.

And when we heal with iron, it is necessary that the maladies be cured according to their possible recovery and replenishment of the body; then they inspect on his back upon a slight elevation, and place under him many layers of cloth.
then lean on his left side, and command the minister to lean towards the right, and extend the rod over one of the two sides where the knot is located.
then take the scalpel in hand, and cut the skin of the knots among them until near the thorn, and make the incision straight according to the possibility, and scrape it gently as possible.
then pierce the thorn hole with a narrow probe, and extract all the blood, and then place your fingers there, and make them ascend the thorn site; and do not touch the knot of the cords, but just the skin, scrape it gently undernee his shoulder as possible, so that if you don't scrape well, the blood will return.
and if the wound were to rise during your work, then reposition him in his place when you have completed the incision of the thorn; then join together both knots of the cords at a suture, and treat it like other wounds until he is healed.
And if you change the corrupted wound with other disease, it is necessary that you tie the threads hanging down, doubting blood circulation; then cut the cord throughout its length, and extract the thorn, and treat it as we have said.
and if the blood is assembled in two parts joined together, you will see that they are twigs; then cut the other part as you did with the first one, suction the wound, and place a clean linen dampened with rose oil on it.
and put another clean linen dampened with wine and oil on it, and place under the twigs of the cords, and lay down doubled cloths over it, and tie according to this form.
Then take two pieces of cloth, and cut the linen scraps according to this shape and assemble them in the waistband on the belt of breeches, one piece goes from the foundation to his back just above the thorn, and the other on the thigh side. The second pair rests on the twigs of the cords, and they are all gathered together at the buckle of the belt.
and never should this rod of cautery be healed in its size with a large iron one, but rather a thin cultured scabbard, cut the skin of the cords, and scrape it gently as we have said, so that when the white skin containing the blood is exposed.
If you take the fire caustic according to this form, and pierce that wound where there are one or two stabs, and scour with this subtle caustic.
And the cup in all ways that you can, until everything is even; and keep that fire does not touch the belly; and know that this work is safer; and avoiding excessive bleeding from the wound, and movements of cutting size.
And if anything goes against you, or cutting off a part of the body or other actions, then treat that which contradicts you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is afraid and does not want to undergo this work because of its horror, then I will make a perforation as I have told you; but only when you are sure from the meanings we have mentioned that it's necessary.
If it seems suitable for the patient to sit on high ground; then pierce the abscess in that area of the body where there is space all around, and make the perforation long with two sharp points; and make wide holes so that all blood flows out.
Then put cotton on the wound, and bind it up, and let any remaining blood drain out, then treat until the wound is healed.
And if the blood does not drain out of the mouth of the wound, then it is necessary to insert a needle or the instrument used to extract the pus from such abscesses; and slightly expand the wound, check that the blood has drained back into its place, and observe for about two months or longer if needed; when it has formed as before, the patient will be able to live out their life without recurring problems.
from the incision on the joints
Know that in this section there are many disadvantages, and it seems to me that it is better left untouched.
And I will tell you the work and the appearance of the incision.

And it is the color of the incision according to the color of the bone; and does not cause pain, and the incision is severe.
And sometimes there are jagged and painful incidents due to fear, and colored stains; and rarely does it come from any other artery or vein swelling.
When it comes from our arteries, if it is directed by the shape of the incision applied to pressure at your place. And does not mean that you should touch it.
That which is made from vein swelling is directed by its shape at the expression of touching both places.
And can properly make an incision according to this appearance, and on the others. And it is that you obtain the color of the blood flow, then it rises to the top, and becomes as white in consistency, and releases the syringe from all parts of the vein.
If the vein is already aligned with these needs, then it means that you must extract the fluid and obtain it.
And if it is on the surface of the fluid or within the valves, then it means that you must release all that is contained therein and obtain a rounded amount.
And if the origin of the growth is behind it, then it means that you must extract all of it and release the fluid, as we have said.
And when your works are completed, then apply the wound with fluffy linen soaked in rose oil and wine, and treat it further for other curing as long as it remains sound.
of the incision of the blood flow.
It is an incision wrapped with a layer resembling a lump, accompanied by the softening of the blood flow. And it murmurs painfully when it moves.
and the curing of this illness is just as fearful as these before,
And thus our works refer to that of him according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you place the painful area on a raised seat first, then release the syringe of blood flow to your places. throughout the entire vein that is near the finger and stains it with the master's mark and extends it;
then extract the blood flow with a wide blade that cuts through all places where valves are exposed, as long as they remain uncovered.
and then scrape off a piece from each, as we said in the extraction of arteries that are on the temple;
Then he inserts a needle or has a thread of two threads, and fastens it at the first point where the wound is located, and then attaches it to the other end. Then they push in a thread carefully according to the length of the cord, and remove the corrupted moisturizers.
Then treat the wound as we have practiced, so that no knot tightens one of the two threads.
Because by this it does not bring harm, and if all the threads have blood flowing through them, it is necessary to treat each thread at every stitch. And it does not lose its tightness from making incisions on the threads, and they do not help each other.
from the method of treating it The relief of this limb is achieved through the part where it comes from or tightens, or the extension on the abdomen in the leg's area, which allows the intestines to descend from that method onto one of the threads.
And this method is either tightening or extension of it, and come from these .ii. manipulations due to various reasons: by striking, jumping, coughing, lifting heavy weights, and in similar ways.
And when it comes to this extension method, if that is the case, then it occurs rarely and infrequently over a long period, without sudden onset. And it affects the internal organs equally up to the peritoneum, because this method presses the intestines.
And the signs are when it comes to this tightening method, as it brings about sudden pain at the beginning, and affects various appearances in the skin around the area, due to the release of intestines and return to the original position from the suture line.
And there is no such thing as pressing the intestines, and they are held in pain, and it causes great suffering immediately when they are pressed tightly.
And in these treatments with fire for fear, it is difficult to escape from them.
And the manner of the work is that you command or advise him to pull the intestine into his hand in the wound if it can be retrieved. then wrap around his neck, between your hands, and lift the wrists gently.
then is applied on top of it, and covers all the skin around the area for long; then place near the thighs some thin sticks according to what you know about how to open the wound and so that they can be removed.
then scrape off the sinew from the skin around the wound so that it becomes fully exposed;
then put your indicator in such a way that it teaches the wound, which is between the white sinew on the underside of the skin and between the second sinew;
and proceed backward from the underside, and between the second sinew; and press to the hand on the side of your indicator toward the skin around the wound, and the white sinews are at the top of your left hand, and lift up all the sinews towards the body's belly. and command him to extend the underside upwards, and loosen what is behind the ligament;
and you should see if there is an intestine wrapped up or white sinew that does not break through, and if none of this happens, put it in the abdomen.

Then they join them together in the manner of a cross, and tie up the sinew we have spoken of that is within the hide of the joints, with a strong thread of two parts. Then they wrap the shoulder joints, and tie them with a strong thread of two parts so that no one can put their hands into it while the abscess cavity does not move. And maintains the thread according to the first strong thread of two parts long, and after these two threads leaves some sinew which is within the hide of the joints, great in size.
And after all according to the roundness it has; then he covers in the part that is within the hide of the joints so much as he can without cutting and bowing, just as we have said before.
Then they prepare a dirty linen in oil, and put it on the wounds, and they treat the thread we have mentioned before. And there is no occasion to causte them white sinews we have mentioned before after the incision, due to doubt about bleeding.
Because it often happens, and they leave the thread hanging so that it breaks in its own time; and if it is delayed at breaking, then it is raised with hot water, and put on as we have said until it breaks.
Then the wound is treated by other treatments so that it heals perfectly.
of hernia (which was not part of the original text)
In this case, I have never seen anyone attempt to treat it with fire (which also does not appear in the original text).
And the old one said that it is made in such a way as to bind the limbs together in part manner like you tie them after cutting into the abscess strongly.
Then they coat it with mead and treat the abscess cavity that is operated on, so long as the limbs are still pulling; and they treat it in such a way as we have said until it heals perfectly.
There is no mention of hernia coming out in the area mentioned before, and they open it up; and if any pieces are taken from the intestines' sheaths, it is little harm done, and they restore everything as quickly as possible.
And in any case if it delays too much on this point, they believe the wound or ulcer, as long as the intestines are pulled out.
And this occurs due to the extension of the sinew in hernia, just as we have said, because it is extended, then becomes softened and swollen and opens up.
And this is treated with caustic, if as we have said before; and it has never been treated by fire in this manner.

And then extract the sinew under the skin where it is inserted, and take hold of the hair and lay it over the exposed sinew;
And then press on the belly at the point where the sinew appears under the hair in the middle of the hair shaft, and count two spots along it, and do one after another.
Then extract the middle of the hair shaft, and do not cover the sinew nor stretch out the belly or anything else, as I have told you in the treatment for unraveling the intestines.
Then treat by treating wounds. And when you cut the hairs, if they bounce back and heal the wound, so long as it is healthy.
The sinew is compressed and has no appearance in the procession, and the caustic is poured into this location, and closer to salvation.
from the softening of the skin around the joints
Many times the joints are softened in some people because the carriages that are inside them become softened, and it is a matter of seeing; and it is necessary when you want to cure it, they lay the malformed under its back, and cope with the sinew which is soft beneath the natural skin; then assemble two sides together with an adhesive bandage, and if you see any excess softened sinew in two or three costumes or four firmly fasten them; then insert between the costumes, and treat it as for other wounds, so long as it is healthy, and bind the filament.

of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two ways: one where between the openings there exists a figure of nature as in a woman with hair and sometimes also cortisol in the urine; The other way is in women, like a rod and openings, and their care consists in treating all related issues similarly to other wounds; In the second case, when men's urine leaks through their skin from the openings, there is no treatment.
of genitogenesis
Genitogenesis is a charge associated with the natural part that appears too hideous to look at; and some women have it as great as a hand, and this is its care. It requires you to trim the superfluous genitogenesis on your finger or toes, and treat it lightly so that blood does not form from excessive bleeding; and another thing about which they said when a child was born with a mouth full of warts and swelling, and it jumped, and according to its appearance the old ones called it "kowe disease." It requires you to care for genitogenesis as we have said, and treat it until it is healthy.
erratic refers to a behavior or condition that is irregular, unpredictable, or not consistent with the norms or expected patterns. In medical context, it can describe fluctuations in symptoms, inconsistent treatment responses, or abnormal test results that do not follow a predictable pattern.
Erratic conditions arise when the woman's nature is not fully perceived or her discomfort is minor; it can be congenital or result from an illness that has come upon her. It may also stem from a condition accompanying birth, such as subtle swelling or spasms, which occur in various parts of the body like the groin, thighs, abdomen, etc., and affect conception and childbirth. The understanding of this condition is based on the medical art's judgment. If these conditions appear near childbirth, they are to be treated with linen bandages that prevent bleeding from reaching the wounds; cleaning it with oil and applying a large cloth wide enough so the wound cannot seal; treating for several days before healing completely. When such complications arise in the groin area during childbirth, treatment should follow this manner, as long as there are no apothecomas present. Because an apothem on the perineum can be touched by a blacksmith's son.
hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins in the rectal area causing discomfort or pain. It is advisable to manage it with a bandage of linen for several days until healed. This term refers to the condition affecting the region's blood flow. Blood clotting near the perineum. The treatment, and if possible hemorrhoids in Old French text:

Of fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
There are many ways of dislocation in the marrow of bones; such as abscess, herpes, ulcers, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and other diseases that I mentioned in this section. Therefore it is necessary to treat in this matter the dislocation of the marrow which occurs in the marrow, which does not occur by blows; and if you know the work of iron, observe whether the displacement begins at the beginning with moisture and fever, and becomes red where you can see it. And do not be afraid to puncture; let him suffer as long as his pain is alleviated; then make him sit on an elevation or two small elevations so that he lies on his back and supports his knees at the joints of the leg; spread out his toes, put his hands under his thighs, and bind them well with a strong bandage; then apply the instrument towards the right side of the mouth of the marrow, as follows: it is necessary that when you present this instrument to him, you cut at first so that you can see how far the cavity goes, so that what enters does not go further than it should, and does not injure the patient; and if the dislocation is large, cover the cavity with a linen cloth or green wool; place the cloth in the cavity of the marrow and on the shiny side of the leg, moistened with water or boiled greens. Then treat for two years after enema, until it heals completely; and sometimes lift up the marrow and the lesion by clyster, and then use honey and root of thyme long strips cooked, and then repeat the treatment. And if the lesion is reabsorbed in the bone marrow, you must avoid scorching it with iron, but treat it as we have said in this section.

If the child comes to his head naturally, and the woman gives birth with crying, and the strength of the man is weak, so let it rest on a seat, or women hold it; and raise its nature from oil or fenugreek, cooked, and then pour the baby between its legs where this shape has. Cut the umbilical cord as much as the moisture which is in the wound; and press the woman's belly until the baby comes down, if it doesn't come out yet, then it must be enemaed with fenugreek mucus mixed with sesame oil for an hour. Now, when the two hands are coming out strongly, you must rattle them lightly a few times; and if they don't enter, place the woman on one chair and lift her feet and head upwards. Then get off the chair onto the ground and scold the woman so she does not soil herself upon standing; and if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, you must take the hands to the knife that is mentioned before, extract the baby, and rattle it again equally.
From the exit of the baby from its feet When the child comes from his feet, it must be lifted up; And then turn it lightly and lightly until it is equalized;
Then press down on both feet and slightly press;
Can it just jump off the couch if commanded to press and then exhale from its chest; If it jumps upward if God wills.
And if it is not as we have said before, turn it little by little until it is according to its natural shape. For the lice, it is a binding.
And if it does not come as we have said before, take wormwood juice, oil of saffron, melted resin, and grind all in a mortar; and apply it to the woman's nature inside her, thereafter. then let it sit on the skin until under the ribs;
and when she is smeared over there, he makes a mirror with miruqe, and puts it in place, and leaves for an hour; then let it sit on a strap, and he makes her stretch out and open her mouth and nostrils, and press down on the belly gently, for the child now jumps. from the issue of the child emerging from his navel. When the child comes in this form, he puts a little pressure on his hands.
from the issue of the child emerging with one hand stretched out. I command to bring back the hand. if she cannot bring it back, then make her stand up and walk.
if she can't walk, then make her sit on a bed, and he holds up the legs in shape.

And if it does not conceive, let her sit on a seat, then study to return the hand back. And when the child resembles a natural figure, and it cries, and she commands that it should hold its breath until it expels fluid.
From the issue of the child from its neck, and stretching out her hands, and turning her face towards her mother. I command that the ball be held in your hand, then turn it slightly and slightly, and let the child move lightly.
And when it is equalized, if placed on the nursing mother's milk and oil, as we have said, then she commands that it should move slightly and slightly.
And when you have done this, if the woman sits on a seat, and she commands that it should hold its breath; and the child cries. In this manner for all the second time.
In this manner for all the second time. When it comes to this manner at all the second time, then cover your second egg until the moisture is gone.
And if the child holds its face and neck, then cover it with a cloth so that it is not restrained, and let the child expel.
Then put the child in, as it should be done, and command the woman that she holds her breath no more.
From the issue of twins. I know that pregnant women give birth many times, and they do not always give birth to 3 or 4; this is not something strange, and it happens rarely. These are things, and they do not live any longer than a little while.
I know they are multiplied, and in them is the seed that causes them to be wet.
And sometimes naturally occur in this manner as we have said.
And if they emit a grievous sound, as we have said in our treatment, and the healer skillfully handles it swiftly and lightly; and does so to regain its strength. of many children.
of many children. And in none of these cases are they formed in marl or clay (i.e., i, ii, iii, etc.), or twenty-four or more such as .xv., and all shaped like a child by the measure of their glory.
and it is known that the healer understands everything, because often such things happen; if they do so as prescribed.
of the dead child.
When you care for a woman after the death of her child or during pregnancy (as I have said in my previous statement), and no miscarriage occurs, then you are bound to labor with your hands. it is presumed that you know if the woman has healthy virtue and does not have any accidents or fear of death.
it is presumed that the woman'inascent on her back and has bent knees, and raised legs.
and the minister applies heat to the woman by immersing her in water (or if she is lying down so that she does not undergo the extraction of the child).
then you apply the clay from the marl wet with honey and myrrh to the woman's mouth and feet, and anoint the healer's hands with these clays and myrrh. then you roll the clay out thinly, and if she has children that are recoverable with this treatment, let her apply them to herself.
and if the baby is already dressed to be extracted from its head. if you fix the children in his ears or neck or mouth or on his palate or beneath the beard or elsewhere on the body.
and if his condition is upon his feet, then you fix him or club him to the knee or injure the sides of his body.
and it is presumed that he will tattoo the child's right hand, place the cord between his left hands, and apply to all parts of his body freely, and fix the child in none of these places we have mentioned so long as he lives without voiding.
then you find another child, or it is your craft if the extraction of his limbs are equal to this one;

And if it lingers on a part, anoint it with oil from any of its joints, and apply it to that part, and draw out the other part.
And if there is a slight delay in healing, place this ointment or higher up on the joint, and apply it until it becomes absorbed throughout the area.
And if one hand comes before the other, and cannot be returned due to compression, since it is required that you wrap the joint with a piece of cloth, until it becomes fully saturated.
then apply it to the plantar joint or at the heel, and this is required that you also do with both feet.
And if the shoulder of the child is large and it is displaced outwardly, or it has an acute dislocation, since it is required that you push the spinous processes between your shoulders, and make the head and extract the acute one. or you turn it to the instrument called "almidache," because its form comes with the bones or joints that are next to it.
and then also make sure that the child returns to its natural position. The phrase "et puis traie fuer les osses as tenailles" seems to be a mix of Old French and an English-like statement that translates roughly to: "and then draw out the bones with tongs." This instruction may refer to a medical procedure in which after the initial heating (baking), the item is handled carefully, possibly for inspection or treatment. However, without additional context related to a specific medical or culinary practice, this statement's relevance cannot be determined accurately.
This line appears to describe another medical condition involving the shoulder ("li chiés") and mentions it being elastic or stretched. The text suggests that if there'e a dislocation with some degree of separation (saint). It seems like an instruction for treating a certain type of displacement injury in which case:
And if it cannot come out, break it apart with force as you can.
And if it swells in the abdomen or on the sides, it is necessary that you pierce as much as the moisture flows.
And if there are stones under its feet, it is a light attraction, and the treatment of the patient's mouth with brine is lighter.
And if it is embedded in the abdomen or uterus, it requires that you extract it with one sheet wrapped around your hand. And when making an incision on the abdomen or uterus, as much as the moisture flows therein.
And if other limbs are fractured and displaced. If he holds his hand in a ball of mud from the river, and draws it out to the mouth of the river. Then he uses two or three threads and pulls them.
And if the mouth of the river has been cleaned due to an abscess that has come in, there is no need for further work on it. Otherwise, he must provide moist and fatty remedies. And the medicines that are most effective, and those with clear watery fluid and softness.
And if there is an embedded stone on the side of its body, and you must place it in a similar way as we have advised for a living child.
And if there is no possibility, then the treatment should be done by separating it into pieces and not leaving anything from the second stage.
And once you have done this, then apply the same treatment to those wounds that come into contact with water in our advice.
And if there are swellings in the blood, place it in clear fluid and administer other treatments.

I called for treatment, and after long days, and could not heal the wound.
I placed on an iron pincers of strong attraction, and drew out some bone, and after many days another one. I was very fearful for it, as the belly had no bone.
I thought it might be the bones of a dead child.
I treated the wound, and with hands of iron extracted bone until it was better for her. And she stayed there for long time afterward and was only a bit weaker in two limbs;

Then follows the shape of a fever, and with it we have the books; and in two turns each joint goes out twice. Generally speaking, the horns are more subtly related to all other restrictions, and they may be made of steel or wood.

And these two adjustments are placed in the mare's mouth when turning the horns.

And when you have opened the mortar with all its instruments, let the woman sit on one leg, bend her knees and turn her legs outwards; Then place both dislocations together in the mortar, and hold the head of the instrument between your fingers; Then work your hand thoroughly on the instrument, as you have done with equal-sized tweezers, according to the amount needed to open the mortar's mouth until it begins its movement;
This instrument is completely surrounded, and its likenesses are many; and when the arrowheads appear to him, the work becomes more difficult, and higher the home for their quantity;
If you do not prepare the instrument, for you have no excuse, as their needs are unavoidable.
When the second stage of childbirth occurs, it is necessary to command the woman that she retain her afterbirth, and then she must expel nasal mucus with force, and restrain your hands at the mouth and nose; And if she falls through that, well be it;
If that does not happen, then take some pot, and make a poultice or flap with the mentioned herbs to open the mortar's mouth like a cauldron, if as calamine, rue, aniseed, chamomile, marshmallow, chervil, etc.;
All these herbs or none of them should be cooked in water above the fire; then place one poultice under the lid and the other on the mortar's mouth.
And let it smoke within the mortar as long as there are vapors inside; then make her forcefully breathe out, as we have said before.

And it seeks the second one; and when she finds it, if she grips and extends it slightly and slowly, so that the muscle does not hurt from removal. But it must move lighter to the right and left, and then pull; if it happens and dislocates.
And if its mouth is gashed and torn apart, we have said the cure of inflating, and smoking with herbs.
And if it is not all that we have said, be careful so you do not harm while pulling;
But it protects that which is in the mouth of the wound, and place it on the side of the woman's abdomen, then perform a lactational enema with medicinal preparations ("lactamentum");
If she pulls and reattaches it, but in all things, if the bad smell comes to the abdomen and head of the patient, then bleed the malady;
If it then confirms that there are useful smokings to this end, no one of the ancient ones has ever proven smoke from chives and dried figs (cressons et figues sec).
The form of the instrument used for smoking the woman with flowers and the second one here is this:
And it is seen as if it were cancerous, and put beneath the skin in its natural state, and large joints above the fire;
And the smoking above coals, and if it has been consumed, renew another;

There comes a child who is born without having properly formed feet, instead with a subtle deformity: As soon as she begins to dance, it is evident that the subtle deformity appears on her foot, and not merely superficial calluses, and we must prevent her from touching it.
Then place a linen soaked in wine and oil on it, then treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will not dislocate again, then put a pin in the wound and leave it for days, and let it heal until the child wants to go into rooms.
And there is never the case of this kind of permanent wound or incision healing by itself; it must be covered with a bandage as we have said about the pin in the wound.
from the base of its foundation Fistulas arising from the foundation are tumors, and larger than those arising away from it or within a space of less than 20 parts (a reference to anatomical measurement).
If there is a fistula or more than one; and when that tumor is old, it should be treated with an open surgical intervention, allowing moisture accumulation or subtle swelling.
And there are no such permanent fistulas; they are recognized by the fact that it has urine or wind production when the patient is making an excretion, and sometimes jumps backward.
And if the fistulas penetrate just to the bladder, and part of the vein; and reach just to the juncture of the thighbone, and to any other bone in the body.
And in this case, it is known that there is a persistent fistula at the foundation and not: And whether you press on your index finger or foundation; and insert a subtle iron needle or wire into the fistula when there is no twisting in it.
And if there is twisting in it, then insert a thin bandage or horsehair so tightly that you feel the bandage or the horsehair against your foot until it loosens.   EXAMPLE OF SOLUTION1:
And if you do not feel it, and no pus excretion or wind occurs there, as we have said. You know that it does not pierce; if you hasten the healer's help.
And when the fistula is near the bladder or the urethra, if it spills urine, and cannot be relieved by medicine.
If it is perceived at the wrist joint, then there will be tenderness approaching its edge. If there is no twisting and the development of pain does not occur, then it is as if it were bowed, and it's worth neither medication nor soothing treatment.
And for these persistent fistulas there is no remedy as such; they are a concern to those who intervene in them.
In that which is not persistent and not ancient, there is hope for healing with iron, as we have experienced.
And it causes great pain between your hands and arms; it weakens the legs up to their knees, and inclines its knees towards the abdomen. Then there must be some attempt at rainwater diversion or water collection if it has twisting; as long as you know where the water comes from.
If the pain is deep-seated, it means you must use your judgment on what treatment to apply.
If it perceives the touch of your hand or if you feel a sharp stab in your gut or flank, and you know that it is persistent. If it cannot be treated, meaning it cannot be made well.
However, there is some that can be well treated, but it soothes.
And the shoulder aid he makes, it is how one sharpens the cautery according to the size of the fistula, as it should be said. And he boils everything in the fistula, until it swells beside its base; and do this several times or three times (or as much as you can), when these faults are discovered to be like a pen feather.
And then the treatment of swollen eyes in bear's fat, until those faulty ones are fully filled, and then the anointing and sealing treatment of them.
If it is so healthy like this, that's good. But if it has another name, it cannot be considered healthy.
And if there is an interference between them, and it does not pierce to where the foundation should be, and between your hand and the tent there is a thick layer of char or syfac, then you see the fistula following that covering. If the caustic is applied at the beginning of the fistula, and boils afterwards before the tent, and the cautery continues as long as it swells in the center of the tent.
And the tent will be delivered, and it is removed; then you eliminate those faulty ones that resemble a bird's feather, and not even one remains.
And if it does not stop with you, and cut between your hand and the work, whether it is treated with fire or by medication.
For the fire caustics involve several things: namely, the anointing of these faulty ones, and the incision into blood vessels and dislocation.
Then the treatment of swollen eyes in bear's fat or while they are boiled down, until those faulty ones drop like beans.
Then you treat the wounds made with heated and dry ointments.
For if it is restored, then it will be healthy and will not return.
And if the fistula comes out from just below its foundation and is separated from both sides of your hand or its base; then you boil around your hand or at the foundation, and ask about it.
If you feel the tent, and there is either linen or fatty substance or faulty ones present; if it has only small traces of firewood and hope for healing through any one of the three treatments:
You either cauterize it as we have said, or you boil the foot if present, or if you put a tent and cure it as in our description.
sans. What, in Old French. then heals, as we have said;
then heals, as we have said; By chance it may be healed, or you should move that hidden covering and the matter away from its base, either by attempt or with another pointed instrument. Then make the necessary clothing fit into the wound as you please.
Then study how to restore the wound and keep the ulcer in the deeper part of its foundation; if it is easier for the patient.
And there is no such ulcers in this way: and when you push the tent into the ulcer, it becomes covered by the skin above. If you take a tent cut to shape according to this form: And you insert such a twisted wire in it, and push the tent around the entire wire until it is at the top of the ulcer.
If it is pressed on the margin of its foundation therein, then pull out the wire that was inserted into that puncture, so you can push your tent around it.
and pull out the top wire, and tie together these twisted wires, and bind them tightly to each other, and leave it like that for one or two days.
and do not tighten it at any time while these wires are between the two that cross each other, and touching.
Then heal the wound as long as it is sewn and sound.
If the ulcer does not penetrate, then you can pierce it in all ways that you prefer, if it is not too deep.
Because it does not require forceful constriction if they are deep enough, and then heal it as we have said, until it is sounded.
The shape of the spinous process which is used to make the ulcer if it is very large and one-sided. And on the other hand, because that is not what should be done anymore, as you can see here:
Eruptions are according to these two ways: either they are in the foundation, like grains of resin, and whether they are small or large, and then blood, And if there is one or more of them and they are pushed into the foundation and at the base; but those that have little moisture in them.
And then the body of a wound.
And the care of those who have within the foundation, so that you command the patient to avoid lying on beds, until the foundations are filled with water, and the child's legs appear. If you hasten, and grasp it with pincers, or take hold of your nail, then cut into its roots.
And if the unguent cannot hold onto it due to its moisture, then take it with one sheet of cloth, or with cotton, or from a small clay vessel. And extract it from your own place, then cut, and powder above any hot powders that may be on the cautery. Or you cauterize as it is said or by the cautery master, then heal them with other treatments until they are healthy again.
And if the foundations cannot be drained, then use a caustic enema to cleanse the patient with it and thoroughly so that he can drain out properly.
Can the maladies be predicted, and if the child's legs are weakened by the foundation, then light treatment is required. And whether you predict with your nail or use pincers, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, so that they are healthy again, and it fears the incision made of iron.
It implies that the caretaker must administer stitches in this manner: take a twisted thread, and bind it with an awl (a small pointed metal tool used for piercing holes), then pull the thread above the awl, and strike the awl from another side to secure both threads atop the awl. And if it is wide; and hold the thread together, then wet the thread, and pull out the awl, and perform these for all others, and leave a little space above the blood in each incision to avoid excessive bleeding ("la superfluition du sang").
Then lay the sheet above the foundation, whether oil roses or clay, and put it over the foundation, and command the patient that he lies down.
And then allow it to heal them while they grow, and other treatments until healing and healthy agains.
:rre:1020 centuries old. Many times happens suddenly in the intestines, and due to natural constriction, and when the illness is old and medicine does not help.
It must be reset at the point of an escortil or to one's ungual skin above it that does not let moisture pass through. then he should be treated so that it becomes firm as it must.
and if it cannot firm up, then restart the cautery with more force than before until it heals a bit, and be scorched; then it should heal.
double friction Formication is a slight fault before the heart, and it goes much further;
and nevertheless the cold blood, and he feels it as if death' Writes of friction, and reaches all over his body, more in his hands than anywhere else.
And the treatment requires you to take a quill feather of an eel or a large vulture's plume, and place that quill on the friction, so long as it colors the friction completely; then turn your hand all around the quill as much as you can, and apply it to the friction, and scrape away the friction from its roots;
And if you see it as a quill made of iron or similar in this shape, and subtle above and below;
do not recognize it for holding two times, and hold it pressed And if you see it, as before the cautery, apply the cautery;
like a washing with cautery Never made use of silver washings or iron ones melted or hammered, nor small and large strigils according to the way they are prepared;
And those which are weak and painful to them must be handled gently in the treatment of children who are small;

And let him put medicines in a best cow's bladder or parchment bag, and pierce all around with small holes.
And there should be space between each hole. It must then be inserted in these holes: a strong thin wire, either straight or curved within a distance of x units, and the abdomen is formed as if it were a calf; And when the medicine is poured in, if the blood comes to the instrument before with a strong wire, then it is time for enema; and this takes the form of a circle:
And the medicine is neither too hot nor too cold, and it should be rubbed on the top of the enema with oil or honey, or something similar, then poured in gently.
Then the practitioner squeezes the medicine with his two hands together, so that it is all visible, then extracts the enema, and lifts up the patient's legs at the knee.
And if the medicine is released as much as it can; and if it stays in all night, then it is even more helpful.
And if you perform an enema during a condition of intestinal discharge, and the medicine is pushed out quickly, then it can restart as long as he becomes well again.
And if the anal fistula is the foundation or abscess, then also the enema should be done subtly as for a child;
And it is the subtle form of enema under which the skin is restrained:
from wounds (This line seems out of context with respect to the preceding medical instructions about cautery and enemas, but it may refer to treatment methods that include such procedures).
We have said in the division of treatments that there are wound care methods; or you will say about hand and medical treatments, according to their completion (This line likely refers back to a previously discussed context regarding various treatments within the text).
I say that wounds are diverse depending on what they are made of, and according to the ways or methods in which they were created; and accordingly from them it is determined (This line further elaborates on the variety of wounds discussed earlier).
Accordingly the things by which wounds are made are by blows of sword and axe, or hatchet and tool, or spear or staff or similar things (This line provides examples of various tools that may cause wounds).
Or they are made according to the types of blows dealt by a person, as if it were wounds on the neck, or on the head, or on the leg, or on the stomach, and similar body parts (This line likely refers back to previous discussions about different ways wounds can be caused).
And I will tell you the treatment for each wound, and first of all I will address simple stomach ulcers because they will arise in my treatise (This line suggests a structured approach to discussing various types of injuries within the medical text).
I say that when a simple wound comes from the head and the bone is not broken, if it'nas caused by blows or similar things, then the skin will be torn and the wound will be large (This line discusses the consequences of trauma to the head resulting in openings or tears, and severe wounds). lesmealies de la parte of thexemence cest d'estroit: ieval a partitivre. leyssus.  ether in it meillustration.

And avoids excessive wine consumption and heavy meats.
And if he does not desire to be healthy, then reduces his meat intake and abstains from wine, bread, and oils.
And applies to the wound where an abscess comes out, he douches it with rose oil or dips it in strong vinegar.
And if there is no abscess present in the wound, if it is fresh throughout and not moved by air or dust, then I will add a little powder afterwards.
And if the arrow has been moved, he applies some ointments to it until it is cured.
And if the wound is large like sword stitching and similar cases, where the lips cannot be brought together due to swelling, he wraps it with a dressing, similar to suturing abdominal wounds or incisions.
If the wound is exposed to bone and cartilage and holds for only a little while, then I will patch it with skin of leather. Afterwards, I treat the wound with medicine and restore its hardness in place of skin. And instructs the patient to eat heavy meats like tested and cooked wheat bread, or turkeys, and similar things.
And if you treat osteoporosis or weakness in the bone, if it is patched completely with leather, and then dried, then I will heal it.
And if there is an arrow in the wound or vein without cautery, and it cannot be stopped by medicine, then you may extract the artery like untying a knot with thread. And if that does not help at all, then cauterize it.
And if these small and simple wounds are the case, then it is lightly treated: and let you apply this powder so that the arrow has moved again.
And the way to make the powder is as follows: take some incense for a part; bone of a serpent for two parts; live coal for three parts, and mix it subtly. And apply it to the wound, and form a dressing around it, so that it heals well and adheres completely to all its flesh.
And then let it dry well, and leave no dampness, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine while it is still healing.
And never made only of coal (lived coal), when one does not have incense and bone of a serpent, but that the arrow has moved the wound.
And if the arrow has moved the wound, immediately there it was, so no one puts this powder on it.
but apply any soothing ointments or millet flour bread made of water and honey, until the wound shrinks. then continue other treatments until he is healthy again.
And if the bone fracture comes with the wound, and it is small, then you should use subtle pinching.
and I will tell you after dealing with these large breaks.
of the wound on the neck
If the wound is on the neck or collarbone, and it does not differ from that large break there, but if the wound on the neck or collarbone separates or splits.
If it's the splitting, there is no other treatment but to leave the healing, and not apply any restricting measures, for it harms the neck and causes retraction. and do not apply any heat to the wound because the body's substances are cold, and its continuation involves the brain, which is one of the most important limbs.
but if the medicine is applied gently, as when it's washed with soft water and mixed with rose oil, and then also washed again with gentle water. and other similar stones in this manner, and damp ointments.
And if the wound is large, then bind and bandage it, then continue treatment until healed.
And if the wound is deep and swollen with blood, then pierce it or go deeper into its cause.
and if the blood is spilling forth, and we are bleeding, and it's time, and they must be culter of cure.
And if the spines of his throat are pierced, or he bites, and the tongue is guarded so that the flesh will not tear. If the wound on his throat occurs, and it is not touched in the throat but set according to its natural shape. And then the treatment of wounds follows, and it is left without healing for any days, until the healing ointments are applied while the patient remains healthy.
And if his wound was compressed within the bone, whether it is so. And if there are bone fragments, you must drive all the thorns out of them and those which cannot be removed; let it heal as long as the wound closes. Or loose and misplaced, dislocation of the joint;
And if the wound is fresh, powder upon the dust as I have mentioned before. And if there are bone in the wound and it has an abscess, then treat it as I have previously described to you in this chapter.
from the wound caused by a spear or knife;
If it is a wound by a lance or knife and the wound is deep, then observe how the dislocation of the spines in his throat causes him great pain and agony. It is understood that such a serious and possibly lethal injury requires immediate attention to prevent further harm.
But if it is not deep, and it is fresh on all its flesh, do not apply the powder in the first hour nor tie down the part of flesh that does not become tender. And recoil into his body, and let go the malade (the ailing patient); But apply attractive oil and bind it twice the day;
And if you have no such ointments applied to it, and put a cloth soaked with blood from the incision;
:preface louge with thej. Airauccarelligive:age defface,saint: "it'sut.gaule. What iare (vague. It'sanguage:jacmeat. Inthisere. Age,later. If not a twitch comes, nor bad shaking of the body does not occur again. And when you see the bone's positioning, if you know that the wound is safe. Treat it then for tent and other ailments, until it is healthy again.
And if it cannot heal, and do the work then you will know that it has formed a fistula; as is due to the treatment.
And if the wound is from a sword cut or knife and it's simple, or on its backside, then treat that which precedes.
If it is thick in substance; and if it is small, powder, and if it has been imbedded in the bone or contains fragments, then treat the wound and burn off any sloughs. And if they are not burned off, then let the wound grow, and lessen the extraction efforts.
And for other wounds on other limbs, we make judgment in that manner which we have described.
double fainting (collapse)
The collapses of the abdomen are great and small;
for a great wound there is no mention of the intestines being torn either in them or within them due to the incision.
and the cautery is more difficult, and there never has been a case where the small wound was worse than the great one.
because in doing so they put back into place the intestines, if not putting them back to back one by one; because the intestines swell immediately when they feel pressure, if returning to place again;
and because it was my worse wound, for that in returning them to their place they move the intestines back into which others do not;
And know that the treatment of the abdomen is according to three methods:
the common cauteries are applied to the treatment of the abdomen;
and the cautery for other wounds of the heart and some other common cauteries are like other similar wounds;
And on all other occasions they are cleaner with the belt around the stomach, and I will say one thing and declare it.
I said that when the wound is small, and nothing from the intestines has entered it. And grabbing the thing is difficult to remove, it is by one of the following methods: Or because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said before. Or because the intestines are inflamed by cold.
And when it is cold, you warm the intestines accordingly: Moisten an sponge or such cloth with water alone, briefly soaked. Or you warm it in running water and sip and sprinkle with salt. And raise the intestines so that they become unswollen;
And never do restrictive measures, but rather warm it softly so as to unswell.
And when you see the swelling decrease, warm the intestines with water or heat them slightly if they are still painful. For this reason it is unblocked easily;
And if it cannot enter, then with some force we use the tool to extract the ingrowns from the wound;
And the first treatment is warming than cutting; that we should not cut it with great necessity without;
And it is the intention for cutting:
if it cuts down in the cavity and does not heal soon, then this happens;
And when the wound is inflamed, and the intestines are pushed out; if it is reset according to the natural form in its proper place; If you have the opportunity, because this is beneficial.
When the wound is wide and it is in the part of his stomach; and requires that you lay upon his body; naturelle and thenca a longvrapportion françaisic and the cité. :faire.
And also in one of its divisions. If it is arranged so that the lower part is higher than the other.
And therefore, this must be supplied in large and small wounds.
In small wounds where there is an appearance of itching.
Then you must hold in your hands one priest who tends to the entire routing with his hand. And bring together the lips. And this is the common way of bandaging.
And this is the common way of bandaging. And it depends on whether you use a needle or several, according to the size of the wound's width. Then leave some hair at the head of the wound and drive in an iron pin with strong thread. And pierce the two holes in the skin with the two hooks of the syringe.
Then the string is drawn through one part of the pin. Then he assembles the two holes in the wound with assembly.
And then leaves some space, and drives in another pin. And then the thread so as you made the first pin. And never cease to do according to what one knows how to make pins. as long as all his wounds are contained;
and be both fine and thick needles, subtle and large because fine needles penetrate completely into the flesh, and large ones cannot easily enter at all: therefore it requires that they be needles:
and it is not required to drive the needles too far into the flesh or skin:
that they do not penetrate and open the wound before sealing (suturing):
and then drive the needles into them, so they do not bruise the maladies while sleeping: and cover them with cloth or bandages so they can hold well: and let it remain so long as the wound is sealed:
and this method of sewing is more suitable for small wounds: because it causes pain or discomfort when a needle is inserted:
The second method is common: and it is that you assembled together the needle ends of the cloth and skin with an old thread, if there is any stitching: and when you have observed these needles in their entirety:
and when you have observed these needles in their entirety: If you reset the arrow to the part where you began, in the manner used for drawing threads.
and leave a space equivalent in size to that of a minor doe between each stitch.
this stitch is its own;
and I sut a wound that one had on his belly;
who was armed with a knife, and it was more than one palm in size, and it was large intestines measuring two palms;
and it was between the belly. I then returned the intestine to him after it had been there for twenty-two hours;
and that wound was sewn up then after fifteen years, and he recovered;
And the judges had decided that he would die, and this was a miracle.
but I did not anoint him with oil either because I was in one location or another where there were no oils nor any medicines; and I put a large amount of cotton on the wound several times during the day, and I washed it with water mixed with honey until healed;
I will now provide a translation of each line from the Old French medical treatise as requested, without additional commentary or contextual information.
Take the needle, and draw on the back side near that area inside.
when she has felt the pain in her shoulder, if you have placed the needle on top of it or pressed with cautery,
and cut on the other side near where it has been placed inside;
and they understand this treatment as if you do it like a leatherworker makes the pelt, and once you have set the shoulder on one side, and then repeat it for the other, until the treatment is complete.
The second method of treatment, which Galen describes properly,
if it is as they do none else, that assembles the four parts naturally, and apply one needle to another in this manner:
put one needle or a second pin at the next point, and cut that part alone, and leave those four cautery points; Then turn the needle, and pierce it deep inside the back part of that there. And when two shoulders are joined together;
Then pierce both of them deep inside the back part where they joined together, in other dislocations that are also on the opposite side;
And that is the more common way and method;
If this word is given by Galien, and no one confirms it;
One must stitch the abdomen with two needles, or thread in each one;
And one must thrust one needle from a side, and the other from another, in the manner of those who stitch wounds with metal strips;
And it is known that when the stitching is in between the belly; If it is the greatest of others, the stitches on the abdomen;
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgments of other wounds;
And it is when you treat the fresh wound throughout its entirety so that the arrow remains embedded; If you reposition the intestine, and its cost; then place powder on the clay jar tightening it down;
If you reposition the intestine, and its cost; then place powder on the clay jar tightening it down; And if the arrow has moved, then apply any oil that is currently present on it, as long as the wound remains open; And consider the thread, and join together the strings, and the flap; Then treat the wound as with others until it heals;
And if you have medicine, put it on the wound, so that it does not move again; And hold them moving a few days until they are sound again.
And you have no other medical knowledge except to treat wounds in various ways;
and if you doubt whether the wound affects the main body parts, if it is required that you loosen the lining lightly with tepid temperature oil or with rose oil; and place it between the arrows, and under the stones;
and if it feels painful pressure in the belly, often occurring; if you enemas black wine and immediately the pressure comes from the intestines;
and pierce through it, and know that when it is the large intestine, it will heal more quickly than the small one;
The young intestine cannot heal when it is twisted; and because of the planting of veins that are there, and due to the subtlety of the entire body, and approaching its natural state;
And if the blood jumps from the wound, he must set it back as with the intestine while fresh;
and if it is thickened or blackened, then you must tie the vein that has turned black, which shows discoloration of blood; because it has veins and arteries;
then cover what lies between them; and place the few hairs of the part around there by the wound until they tighten up;
and bind the flesh, which may relate to dislocation, ito bind the chascale: “fier, et ilz à vassine les cest ce queil ence methode duesme: "

because I see that some men have been wounded in the abdomen from an arrow.
and it was a wound on his right side of the stomach. and it became infected and turned into a fistula, and in this way there was an obstruction in his digestion and wind.
I gave care according to what I saw, and never ceased to skillfully treat him until he was cured, and his limbs were bound together.
And when I saw him bound together, I doubted that he did not have badness in his abdomen. and he had no illness, but improved in better conditions, and moved and ate.
And no one informed that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it must be tied up halfway. take great care in handling the wound, and then bring together the lips of the wound. and when he carefully oversaw the mouth, if it is placed on those two lips.
then he applies another touch after that manner as before, until the wound has been fully treated.
and cleanses the wound. That's how it enters into the intestines without causing any harm to the patient.
and if it can be tied with a fine thread that is taken from an animal's intestine.
in such a way: take the main part of that intestine thread that is twisted. and then ties it with that fine thread of linen. then he drives the linen thread into the intestine and ties it off in a knot.

And if the wound is great and wide, immediately when it is in one of the hollows inside, there is no remedy or healing for that subtlety.
Whether it's a fistula or if it's within an internal cavity. It is said that all wounds and abscesses, when they harden, are everywhere called "fistula." And immediately when it is swollen and bound tightly,
And a fistula is according to some the useless and painless hardening of nodes, or when no pain is felt, And it is also swollen like the quills of a bird;
And sometimes it is clearly tight and thick, and other times thin; Sometimes little, and sometimes enough;
And I have spoken about it in the division of wounds, that every wound which is not healed has no cure; It's due to one of seven causes:
It's to do with small amounts of blood or tissue; Or due to its harmfulness; Or because it is hard inside, and under the lips where it does not allow birth to occur; Or it has too much swelling; Or it is a thorn, and its material quality is bad; Or the medicine is not good for the cure; Or it is because that way of plague-like disease; Or because of the property in this region it is late digestion, and healing takes time, and it naturally flees. There are also veins or bones:
And I have already shown these various causes and signs, and treatments of medicine in division.
Or it is incumbent upon me to teach you the treatment of a fistula, which is done through manual operation.
It happens that a fistula appears in all four limbs; for it has fistulas that arise from great veins, arteries, and nerves; or to the bowel, or the bladder, or any one of the ribs; or at the spinal level of doubled twins, or in any joint of the hands or feet;
:
. And you must see if there is a trial with arrows or iron, if the hole is straight, then pull it.
and if the hole is twisted, then look for a subtle attempt to close it. because the stones bend inward due to their twisted nature.
and if the hole is deep-seated, then you cannot effectively find it with trials. if one attempts to use enema in one of the depressions.
because moisture from another depression affects it and discolors it.
then it may have shifted downwards, so you must know whether there is bone or nerve involved, and see if it has healed properly.
and it is good for the patient to tell you the pain he feels when pressing on his limb, as well as where the pain is located.
and when you truly know the location or whether it is distant from a joint, nerve, artery, or vein... or if there are none of the places I mentioned that correspond to what I've said...
or if there are none of the places I mentioned that correspond to what I've said... and bones for the opposite side and the damaged ones within... and then let it heal so long as it is sound...
but if the dislocation is deep-seated in a proper location, then it must be addressed in its entirety as far as possible... And then he places damp bandages in medical water, and puts them on the head of the abscess.
And then he places damp bandages in medical water, and puts them on the head of the abscess. And the medicine removes any excess that lingers at the bottom.
And then he applies warm salves of sound health until it is whole again.
But if it is not made whole by that, as we have said for the cautery, then he shall:
And if the bone has been corrupted by the fistula, let him burn it. If bone or major limbs are not hindered or troubled, as we have mentioned before.
And if the bone has been exposed, and it is corrupted and blackened, then let his kingship endure until all of its corruption is removed. Then he shall treat such salves for it to be sound again until it is whole.
But if it is not sound again, let him wax weak as before. You know then you have not gone so far:
If you discover and desire it such that you may be at the bottom again. And remove all of the corruption thereof then restore it.
And if it is so sound then it is well. If that is not so, you know then the corruption is too deep to be remedied herewith; If there be no other remedy than that which has its natural laxative quality;
And if there is but a little bone corrupted, and you may extract it with tweezers; If the extraction is to be done with an instrument available hereof;
And if there is still an os left, let him remove it not so that one may remain behind;
And if it is contrary to the medicine; and it shall not endure then withal. In medieval medical advice in chief sanz lixelaises descoction de laissiers dextrait ceu.

And if it is a great bone, as of leg or thigh, and king as long as his stain remains black throughout the entire bone. then heal the wound;
and if there is a large part of his tainted bone, causing it to become softened; and if it is sewn with silk and covers all just the same as the putrefaction, and then heals him until it is solidified again;
and I will tell you about a fistula that happened in one man's leg; and thus you shall find examples and assistance in your endeavors;
It was a young man of about thirty years who suffered pain in his leg due to an issue that arose within the body;
so long as the substances entered into the leg and were expelled through a large abscess without an apparent reason to open it;
but the physician through his insanity worked upon it so much that he opened the abscess; and they inserted many materials, and it turned into a fistula, and there came forth much drainage causing all parts to sag and become softened;
and yet he put further care into it for about two years, and nothing was done with his hand;
As long as I was called for it, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which he was treated. And this occurred through deep wounds; And his young body turned red and had a yellowish tint.
I built a tent over one of these wounds, and then searched for all the wounds;
And I found that one came across the other from every part of the leg;
So I hurried then, and dug down into one of these wounds until I discovered a part of bone; And I found it rotten and decaying, and the rot came right to the bone inside;
I took that which appeared from the rotten bone and looked after it to be sure there was no other rot because of what I had seen;
And I began to restore the wound with similar medicines for long periods, but couldn't sew it up;
And then I considered again, and discovered the bone as I had seen before;
And I found the rotting continued inside the bone, and I treated it again, then took it out, and regretted trying to sew up its place;
But I couldn't do much more than cut into the bone itself, and it broke down entirely; Then I restored it with similar medicines; and it was healed and sewn up quickly;
And they no longer need to consider the treatise except due to the frailty of that malade who could not suffer; Trebucher:espaing in chief ailve presbyroghs. Laurels For because of the bleeding often occurs, but it was completely healed.
For because of the bleeding often occurs, but it was completely healed. And out of the bone grew hard stone, and it had good positioning and did not cause any harm or disadvantage in any way, neither to its neighbors nor towards others.
And are at the head, so that you may return the corrupted stone underneath the bone. and discover the stone on top of the layer or you see sutured it, which does not let the stone break apart. and places a torch or cover underneayer the bone to prevent the corrupted stone from moving. and it is necessary to suture as much as one can see or feel the corruption, and to suture again another time.
And if the bone is corrupt, and it does not open (a fracture), and the corruption is in its surroundings or within a part. If they discover the joint completely; then place a burning stick on it.
And then tie one part to the other from the corruption, and make it longer by quite a bit as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, then treat the corrupted joint, and tie it with bone from the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuity of those two joined areas, then there's no need for anything else but to cover it.
And if the corruption is in the thumb of the hand or on the backbone, that's a very serious matter. But everything requires you to investigate that corrosion and see how it affects you. And manifest it in all ways that you can, but make sure the vein or nerve does not harm you.
And know that the incision and sutures used to cover these bones are many, depending on the arrangement of the bones and appearance of the feet. And their thickness and subtlety, and their size and smallness, and their hardness. And therefore it requires preparing an example of such workmanship for each situation.

and when you have acquired medical knowledge for the treatment of corrosions by curing with medicines, they do not benefit at all; if it is necessary to cover that limb up to the joint or until the corrosion comes; if the patient suffers from it due to death or by malice, which is greater than that of a member's dislocation;

and if it comes or pierces all of it, then... (the sentence seems to be cut off) and if it ascends into the leg, then at the joint of both knees.
and if it comes above the knee, then there is no other remedy for this patient's death but to let the hair grow.
and the manner of covering or binding the limb is that you bind it above and below. and extends some measures downward on one side of the binding, and others upwards on the other side. and you remove the cloth that is between those two bands at one point where there is a wide joint.
then the cover or cloth, and puts a piece of wool on each side, so that the cloth does not touch the healthy flesh. and heals other injuries and abscesses in the patient.
And if blood is shed during your work, then you should swiftly cauterize the wound. or you apply some restrictive powders; then return to your medicines until they are finished.
then bind the swollen limb with a covering bandage, and treat it until it is sound.
and I will tell you what happened with one man who was poor in faith:
he had a blackness that seemed as if it were covered with fire.
and that corrosion came first at the joint where his virtue was.
and when he saw the corrosion, he bound it with coverings, and was sound again.
and long afterwards it came back in his hand, and he went to me.
and I put on him things puncture-like after his purification from the curse, but it could not stop the corrosion.

Yet I have not heard such tales before this one, for there is no other like it.
Never has the stone been moved from its place without great assembly of bowmen to delay it in lengthy measure. Then they advance and pierce, and the bow jumps, much as we valiant ones do fare; And the skin above is also subtle like that of a splendid tapestry; And they will not disturb bone nor sinew, nor such diseases called "sane" are thus disturbed.
But if it is so elongated as to shift within the bone's bounds, 'tis then the "fistula" disturbed.
And if one must heal that skin entire in depth, and first when subtle it is as valiant drapery. And no fear for its corruption is found.
And if you hold faith that it shall be healed, and its decay is not found therein. And that hide is speckled with marrow's charm, so shall the ensuing clay be cleansed herein now.

Do this many times until the breasts are made firm and immobile, so that they do not move. This instruction is in line with medieval practices where repeated treatments were often employed to achieve a certain result - in this case, making the breast tissue less mobile which might be indicative of an underlying condition being addressed.
And there is no mentioning of washing with water mixed with ashes ('clisteriseis d'aigue de cendres'). This implies that in the context provided by these lines from a medieval medical text, it may not be standard or recommended to use such a method. The phrase suggests a potential exception rather than common practice. When this medicinal mixture is not present, and you must promise charcoal from grapevine wood, and pour water above. This instruction suggests using alternative methods when the usual medicinal concoction isn't available—charcoal made of vinewood and the application of water. In medieval times, these substances were likely used in various treatments or poultices.
Then pour it (likely referring to a liquid mixture), and wash the breasts so long as you know they are well formed. This implies an ongoing treatment where monitoring is key—once the patient shows signs of improvement or normalcy in breast formation, one might consider altering the course of treatment.
And if the maladies do not suffer from it, and this Egyptian medicinal mixture or water with charcoal does not help. This statement seems to indicate that in some cases, these methods (Egyptian remedies and charcoal washes) are not effective for treating certain ailments. If the washing with water and honey has some slight inflammation, or if there is a little biliousness ('litargire'). This observation points out that even well-intentioned treatments can lead to mild negative responses such as irritation. It emphasizes careful monitoring of patient reactions during medieval medical procedures. Or you may wash with honey and milk that the honey has properties to heal and cleanse. This suggests using honey—a substance known for its antibacterial properties during medieval times—in combination with another medicinal agent (milk) in a therapeutic practice. It implies an understanding of honey's benefits beyond just taste, recognizing it as both curative and cleansing when mixed with other ingredients. And the wine airs out (the sinew); this indicates that wine may have been used in a treatment to aerate or cleanse muscles or sinews, potentially suggesting an application of wine for therapeutic purposes such as massage or poultice. This aligns with medieval practices where various liquids were utilized for their perceived benefits on the body's tissues.
And when you have done this (the treatment), and you know that the breasts are well formed—this statement serves to provide a condition for ending or continuing a treatment regimen. It emphasizes patient progress as an indicator of successful intervention. In medieval medicine, the practitioner's knowledge about the outcome was crucial in determining future therapeutic decisions. If the washing with that causes a hardening in them (the patient), this indicates a potential adverse reaction to a treatment method—presumably involving water and some other substance ('ceu') used during the wash. The term 'char' suggests an undesirable firmness or rigidity, which could indicate complications from the procedure.
And you must promise stiffening of the diaphragm ('emplaustre'), and do it with rosy oil and in wine—this instruction points to an intervention aimed at strengthening the diaphragm. The inclusion of 'rosy' oil is a bit unusual but could be referring to a type of essential or medicinal oil that was used for its healing properties, possibly applied through massage with warm wine as part of the treatment process. Or you may wash it (the patient) with any medicinal mixtures and anointments of which I have spoken—of the properties or uses of these anointments. This reiterates that various mixtures and therapeocolloidic preparations, including ointments ('oignemens' in Old French), were used as part of a wash (or clisterize). The mention suggests a reflection on the effectiveness or purpose of these treatments.
And if the fistula is small, and it may well enter the wash (clister). This seems to suggest that in a relatively minor abscess ('pertus' in Old French. A 'petitement d’une partie du ventricule lees devises, et seingle bécoeur loratnceur. ions iton thepixel ofsautume, ete ofte tolloire (ouesla. In theend. Aude. C'': " :mesurectures: 'n'toute :entire.

And if you cannot cover his breast as you see fit, If it appears in such a way that the bowel moves downward to its lowest point,
It seems like there was a repetition in your request with the line "si appareille en tel maniere que li bowe corre au plus bas leu que i est," but based on your first instruction, this does not appear to relate directly. If you're looking for confirmation of f(-1) being -17 as previously calculated, then that part is confirmed. However, if "si appareille en tel maniere que li bowe corre au plus bas leu que i est" was intended to be a different expression or question within the same context, please provide more details for clarification on how it relates to finding f(-1). If you meant something else, feel free to ask! The phrase "si appareille en tel maniere que li bowe corre legierement aval" seems to be describing an alternative scenario where the bowel moves slightly downwards. However, if you are asking for how this affects f(-1), it doesn't directly impact our calculation since we already have determined that f(-1) is -17 based on the given polynomial function f(x). If we're discussing the context of medicinal interventions based on this line in French, it translates to "and take consolidant medicines to put on the chest." This doesn't directly relate to our function f(-1). However, if you are looking for an algebraic or mathematical connection between taking medicines and evaluating a function at x = -1 (which has already been determined as -17), it seems there might be some confusion.
The phrase "et estent sus .i. drapeil de lin que cuevre tout le sein" translates to "and are placed under a linen sheet that covers the whole chest." This part of your instruction seems unrelated to our function evaluation at x = -1, which was previously calculated as f(-1) = -17. The phrase "puis cope as forces endroit le pertus dou premier" translates to "then cover up the wound in that place more than before." This line could metapranitimately describe a medical procedure. In relation to our polynomial function f(x), there's no direct connection unless further context is provided on how this relates to mathematical analysis or algebra, which isn't given here.

And it comes to the bone in such a way that there is pestilent pain and the dislocation of both shoulders, and the skin turns yellowish.
When you treat it as we have described in the separation, the treatment does not bring any benefit. It indicates that you must remove any excess iron that remains after the nail treatment. And then cauterize the wound afterwards. The lancets are very helpful if the bone is healthy, and the joint is sound.

and if it is infected, and you touch it, and it causes great pain, then it requires you to heal it first. then break the joint sharply by cutting across above it.

It now requires that you do not ever catheterize him, and then cleanse his base with water.
The treatment with iron should be according to the following manner: one is to cut open and draw out the black blood. And the other method is to bind the vein and draw out all the blood.
The cutting is done in this manner: raise the first leg of water very hot, so much that the large mass does not slip. Then strain the patient's bad leg above the kneecap, just up to the part on the inside of the groin. Then cut into a vein in one spot, two or three spots, making it wide enough...
Then draw out the black blood with your hand from one end to the other until enough of it can suffer without pain.
And then bind it up and order him to eat black meat binding a catheter inside.
And restart the evacuation and cleaning whenever the veins appear plain, and do not harm the patient.
The patient's discomfort is done in this way: raise the bad leg, if it has quite some hair. Then he places it or bath, and the dislocation of the wet leg turns red to a bluish color until it swells in the joints.
And if you do not have a bath, then heat it with fire and apply the warmth to the long portion at the top of the knee, or on the part near the ankle.
Then after unclogging the vein, and scraping off the skin from each section until it becomes soft when touched.
And when it turns red and black, and when it feels like a slender string of tough material;
Then place it around the area, so that the skin is relieved of the vein, and then suture back to the unclogged vein.
Then in another part of the body such as this joint, apply it there for three times; then scrape off the skin on the vein until it feels soft. Then lift it up again, just as you have done, and suture to another clogged vein if you have performed similar steps before.
Then take another size if you have the skill to do so; then lift and apply it over both sides of the joint, where there are multiple issues.
Then apply it slightly larger than the previous size; then stretch in small increments until it becomes firm all around, and then secure.

And if the vein appears contracted and twisted, encapsulated together, and it is not straight as we have said. It implies that you should divide it (the vein) irregularly but not cut it off entirely; and treat it as we have previously described.
It implies that you should divide it (the vein) irregularly but not cut it off entirely; and treat it as we have previously described. The iron rod with which the vein is cut if it has a hook-like shape should not be used to cut it entirely, that it does not pierce the vessel.

This vein is entrenched in the legs, in warm parts of the body where it does not produce grass or trees and on land where there is no moisture.
And sometimes it appears elsewhere than in the legs, and this is due to dirt that accumulates under the skin.

The pain that comes from windiness. This disease is awakening in our land "vakirir", and it is a pain that comes to any limb. And it moves from limb to limb; and that I tell you is what I see.
I called upon a sick woman, and she showed me her arms, where I saw a small swelling at the vein's entrance.
And shortly after, I saw it rise further like a worm to her shoulder. Most quickly as anything, like live silver cut from one piece to another.
The pain separated from that part and settled in her shoulder.
And then shortly after it ran throughout her entire body until she came back to the other arm.
Then she told me that it would turn back into her entire body once more, as I saw.
I marveled much at how she moved from limb to limb in this manner, for never have I seen such a disease proceed like this before. Always, I had seen many who wanted to move pain from one part to another. But I had never seen it in this form before, as I saw in the woman.
And I thought it might be because the woman had a dry heart, and the veins discovered. And for that reason it appears to be constrained by windiness.
And it does not appear in this way to those who are fortunate, with moist hearts and veins restored.
And when you see this disease cured, and the sick person feels that pain again if it presents itself as we have described, If the ligaments above and below are loosened swiftly, and then pressures on the constrained windiness cease completely. And you then cauterize his veins: and ifte sanz ceulx.

Arrows
Arrows are diverse, depending on their shapes and whether they enter from one side or both sides.
The diversity of their shapes is that there are those with large points, and small ones, and hairs, and welded. And there are those with two-pointed arrows, and those with long ones, and some that have fragments. And that which hurts in no member but hinders movement according to two ways: or the hairy one;
If like a brain, it is, heart, shoulder joint, liver, pelvis, intestines, bladder, and similar limbs. If it no longer has any position in these members, and the sign of death that I will tell you afterward is: Since it indicates that you must carefully extract this arrow, as the wound comes with many injuries afterwards. And when this bad sign does not appear to you and the arrow is not in place, then treat the wound.
And the sign when the arrow strikes and pierces through bone, and a spark flies upward where it is in the skull. It is when scotomas and hemorrhages appear, and inflammation and swelling in the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding, and vomiting from the colon. And possibly without breathing through the nose or ears; and perhaps affects speech and voice as well. And bleeding white spots appearing like frost, and also similar to wet from burning char.
And if this sign appears to you, then take care of it and treat the arrow if it is still embedded.
The sign of the swelling when it is close to the left breast, and it feels as if it were embedded in something hard, not empty. And possibly it also becomes silent like the pulse, and in black blood, cold sweat comes down with a chill, and syncope. You know now that this wound will come undone.
And the sign of the arrow that never stops being without respiratory secretions jumping from the wound, and swelling in the throat, and the painful colors come out, and high spitting up and coughing with a cold.
And if the arrow strikes in the back covering, it is located near the small of the back; and it causes great pain all over, and spitting everywhere and every joint moves.
And if the arrow hits the abdomen, perhaps there is no discharge of anything edible from the wound.
And if the arrow hits the belly, and there is no hope in the extraction of the arrow.

The other member, like the face and neck and throat and shoulder and humerus and spine at the back and forearm and wrist and legs, and the seemingly member are safe in many respects. The saffron is in the nerve or artery and it's not poisonous, as I will tell you because you do something else.
It happened at one house where there was a saffron that fell or snagged on the root of a nail: I tried it, and it caused pain elsewhere in the ear grease, without any particular symptom.
And I caused pain by dropping a saffron that fell into the fat underneath the paper beneath. And the saffron was replaced, but it didn't move further towards the edge. And the saffron was large like an archer's arrow, in every way light to the ears; it caused no unusual or unfortunate event. (Note: The metaphorical interpretation of "li saiette" as something small and pointed that could be used by an archer.)
And I caused pain in the throat with a stone-like saffron, which was Arabian-like to ears. (Note: The metaphorical use of "li saiette" for stones and its description as 'Arabian-like' relating to ears.)
I smoothed the hairs, and subtly caused it until I did so; there was pain in the throat. (Note: Interpretation of "les barbions" as being related to saffron and its metapomedical effect on causing discomfort.)
And I caused pain in one house where the saffron was hanging or protruding from either side (face) and thought it might be dead. (Note: Here, "li estoit cheue" is interpreted as a metaphorical expression of something like 'hanging' or 'protruding', likely related to an object rather than actual facial features.)
And then after passing thirty years, its position did not change. (Note: This statement seems unrelated to the previous metaphorical content but could be a reference to something related to 'li saiette' remaining in place.) I cut under the saffron, and removed it, and caused pain when done; there were no unfortunate incidents. (Note: The interpretation remains consistent with earlier metaphorical use of "li saiette" as an object causing discomfort after being altered.)
And if you see a house where there was a saffron that fell or injured on the back, and it caused a wound to be sewn up there: (Note: Interpreted as an actual event involving 'li saiette' in a metaphorical sense related to causing harm.)
And it stayed within the body and did not change its natural conditions: (Note: The statement seems to be conveying that whatever was 'li saiette' remained unchanged within a contextually relevant setting.) And it does not cause harm in any of its natural actions. (Note: The statement reflects back on the metaphorical use, suggesting that 'li saiette' or whatever it represents did not result in negative outcomes when performed naturally.)
And see another man where there was a saffron that fell into his face and caused the wound to be sewn up: (Note: Continuation of the metapromptual theme, maintaining the metaphorical sense attributed to 'li saiette'.)
And in this way he suffered great pain, and there were many such cases. (Note: This statement follows the previous one, likely describing outcomes similar to those metaphorically linked with 'li saiette'.)

I called for the treatment after it had been healed, two years ago. If I found the wound to be very wide.
I tried to feel it with utmost subtlety, and did not sense it at all. And he felt nothing but pain in his right ear. I thought it might be the point of the lance.
I put it on the empyreal fire to heat up its digestive properties, for they did not flame. And from it came forth blood from the lance.
And from it came forth blood from the lance. I used the empyreal fire on my hands for many years, and it effectively healed the wound directly, yet still left a long-lasting pain.
So long as he felt the lance inside his side every year. And then I told him. I put cauterizing medication against the wound for many years until it healed over.
And I tried it on his chest, and felt the lance's point lift off from its place. Then I applied a concoction of corrosive medication on the overhang of the wound, and soon after the lance'ayer became clearly visible.

And yet I continued to subtly manipulate and arrange the instruments of treatment, for a year that I had well-made pliers. According to what comes at the end of this chapter, as long as I treated it and kept the wound closed.
And the judge considers that the nose chart cannot restore: I reclosed it however, and the wound was sewn shut, and the patient's painful conditions were healed completely.
Or you spoke about the quality of extracting some arrows. If you place your remedy where I do not mention it, for the books cannot encompass everything.
However the master surgeons write only very little about it; and concerning what they are both proficient in and not, there is scarcely a word. Perform nine operations and with no instrument for the extraction of foreign objects in this practice.
I say that the arrows do not come from limbs but are driven by certain techniques. Or they enter by the skin's surface or through another means.
And that which jumps out by means of a slingshot enters the body cavity, and it has never happened before.
And if it does not jump now, let her lie down until the wound is healed and the exit allowed.
And if it is embedded in the bone and cannot be extracted, then leave it for any number of years, and let it move each year.
And if it does jump, and if not, penetrate to the point where there was once touched, and then pliers were used.
And if the splinter is returned to the joint it cannot be seen, and covers all of the skin with swelling. and if you feel it, use no device that is not available.
and if you cannot compress the wound tightly and remove the splinter completely, and there is no bone, nerve, or vessel within it if the wound remains large. and pull the splinter if you can, but if it has ears in the splinter that hold onto it,
and pull the splinter if you can, but if it has ears in the splinter that hold onto it, if the bone is lodged by less than one-third that you can do it; and then break or slacken the ears in the splinter as much as you can pull it out;
and then break or slacken the ears in the splinter as much as you can pull it out; and subtly so as not to break the splinter, but pull it out more quickly.
And if you cannot remove it once, if the bone remains within its place until it can be done, then do so because the extraction is painful. And if the dislocation returns after bloodletting, then administer what we have told you about the treatment in this chapter.
and warn you about the incision into a nerve and the vein, and how can I remove the splinter without danger?
whether quickly or gently, or firmly or beautifully; and set the barber as he was when it fell into the joint. For it is one of his greatest helpers, and if you cannot, then according to that which the sign shows him.
The slinger says that it comes from another place where there is nothing of him seen or felt abruptly:
Then measure the size so that the pliers can grasp it, and then pull out the sling: if it were to jump now.
And if it is held in the bone, turn thy hand roundly therein, until thou enterest the bone, and swell the bone; then draw out the sling:
And if it cannot be extracted, let her yet remain, then again attempt the extraction until it draws forth:
And if it were of slinger’s making, then thrust into the whole length:
And if it were fastened, and thou shalt administer a binding thereon, shouldst thou employ an instrument of hair: And should the point of the sling enter into the hair of the instrument; then thrust forward:
And if the sling be made of hair, then thrust therewith an instrument with point entering in to assist in drawing out:
And if the sling be touched, it is necessary that thou cover all of thy chest or therein lies some poison; shouldst thou have it: Then heal the wound as it may require:
And if the sling be fastened on thigh or stomach or in the bladder or abdomen; and it is present near, then cover it, should it cause trouble:

The shape of these pincers has similar hooks to a bird's beak, and here it goes:
And there are many of them in use: large, medium-sized, and small, depending on the quantity of arrows.
common arrows Healthy arrows that are XXI, from which one has to extract six.
It's known as: II battle axes that are after the ears, called "douc" herbs; And the II arteries that are appearing from the II temples; and II arrows that are inside the II saliva ducts, called "aspires"; and the arrow that is embedded in the forehead; and the arrow that has a head of six; and the II cords that are on the neck; and the II arrows that are above the lips, which are called "aguerriques"; and II arrows that are inside the tongue;
The arrows that are commonly healthy are V in each arm;
one is on the left side of the skull, and it's called "arrow with a head" among people; and the middle one is called "fast" and consists of the cephalic and base; and people call it "arrow of the heart"; and the base is on the right side; and people call it "arrow of the abdomen"; and it is located within the fistula. And it is that which cures when clearly opened above the bag.
And the salve is the vein that lies between the little finger and the ring finger, and if there are two of them.
and in the leg, where there are three veins: one is inside the right knee pocket-joint. and the second sign that is at the top of the right knee-joint, and the vein that lies in the middle of the other thigh's side;
and in the other leg, there are three of those veins as well.
The salves or treatments for these veins are after the ears and aid to old catarrh (chronic mucous discharge) and migraine. And its quality is like what I have told you, and it must be that you reset the head of the mallet.
And its quality is like what I have told you, and it must be that you reset the head of the mallet. And it is applied on or to these veins with an abrasive cloth; then close the mallet's head by means of a screw. as long as these three veins show behind the ears in a similar position to their respective heads' bases; know that when it is done by you, and do you feel the hairs on your head during this procedure if they become engorged.
then take the lance, and drive it into the vein thereunder, and hold your hand on top of all the hair. (13thans. Etienne: "laine descoa. Here iste itens :en françaisses sans. 12000 duoftesme aoutrage duit leuces laissie quilce devisme andreinse, oumescribe duoile ofrleave fromage.
then strain and bleeding, as long as it is healthy;
And I have already mentioned the incision and the fire cautery in the first book.
The painful joints that are in the neck area, if they belong to ancient traditions, And also, and otitis common to this practice, and at the corners of tears are these waters.
And the quality of these painful joints if they are as I have said: And it is that the severed vein shows itself openly, as long as these three veins are exposed. And it feels the pressure around your head, and then you get involved.
Then you feel the key under the vein on top of your head with an index (a small pointer or tool), and push in the lance (surgical instrument) there. And feel the vein on top, and the bleeding, if you have done it in the same way with other veins, and make correction to the blood according to your necessity.
Then straighten the dislocated one, and put your head on top of the vein for an hour, then put it on cotton.
And then the bleeding forms, and let it continue as long as she is healthy; and we have talked about our practices concerning bloodletting and extraction, or at the beginning of the book.

And place the point on the vein, and hold it firmly in your hand, or by something else, and let the blood flow according to the amount you see. And then instruct the patient to keep the shoulder in place and hold the vein until it is healthy and not hindered by a wide swelling.
Always, it does not require that the swelling be too large; and if the vein is crooked, because the bone is close by, and perhaps breaks the vein when it is slightly obstructed.
The healthy veins that are in the cheeks help their blood flow, and to the tongue, and to the teeth, and to the oral cavity, and diseases of the face.
And the quality of their veins is that the patient's dislocated shoulder twists in no way when touched, as before.
Then the vein is healthy, and its depth should be measured to be somewhat deep but not too wide because it does not have any flesh covering it.
And if the vein is slightly obstructed, perhaps it breaks; then make an incision in the blood, according to your skill, and tie under the collarbone, and fasten well.
The healthy vein of the neck is not liable to bleed and has no inflammation or swelling in it, as well as diseases of the face. Like inflammation and teeth problems that appear in the face, particularly when they are old.
And the quality of their veins is that the patient's dislocated shoulder is retracted by his left hand, then draw back the neck vein with his right hand. And take the fine obstructed vein long and cut it close to the mouth in the space between the two nostrils. Because the vein does not open easily, and it will now begin correction;
And do not apply too much pressure, and make correction according to your necessity, then bind the blood with a cord at night, because it is quickly restored.

Then widen the vein a little bit, then drain the blood quickly, as it is usually done by skill.
Then reopen the other vein, slip the ligature there, and tighten the blood vessels slowly. That he does not strain it; and let him leave it until the morning, so that the wound is cleaned.
Of book cleansing The cleansing of the veins above those assisting in drawing blood from the mouth, and prevention of gum disease, and cracks on the lips, and sores inside the mouth.
And the quality of the cleansing is that it makes the patient lie down with his pained area facing you, and hold him as I have said before. Then turn the mouth open, and look at these two veins, one on the right side of the mouth and the other on the left side. And they are known by the fact that they are black, and because their inside has thin black veins: And now let us consider both, and if you do not know them, then doubt arises.
And now let us consider both, and if you do not know them, then doubt arises. If you can find the largest one of each side, and similarly perform on these two veins that are above and below, because it is a similar method.
Of the cleansing below the tongue The cleansing of these veins below the tongue helps after the cleaning of the cephalic (head), and it is related to the tightening of the throat, and diseases of the eye, and diseases of the mouth.
And the quality of that cleaner is when he sees the patient's mouth between his hands in front of the sunlight, and feels the tongue softly, and look at each side vein.
Safe now both, and not to go too far with it, for they are blood vessels.
The veins commonly treated which are considered healthy are managed according to:
You prick at all of them. Whether it's a broad flake like with cutaneous tuberculosis or subtle like an olive pit, call it "asil"; And are wide and subtle according to the width and thickness of the veins. The form of the broad flake is very well-known, and it's wide like you can see.
And it is necessary to open the veins covered with thick visible blood and that contain large amounts of such and turbidity. And it is the form of the olive pit:
And it is more subtly pointed, and is for the health of finer veins, or they have fine yellowish blood.
The health of the bladder vein, which is one of these veins, helps with diseases that are in there throat, and neck, and chest, and belly.
And it is for the patient that he should heal quickly and beware of the artery which is therein. And if it cuts the artery and bleeds out blood, then he must be warned as I have said. And it should not be pricked by the broad flake, but cut like asil.
And if the bladder vein does not open clearly, it must be drawn out and changed. Or you want no pain from it, or heal the vein in its place with your arm; it opens clearly. And cuts at asil, like we have said.
And if you know the place of the health vein, then it must be drawn out with your arm as long as you feel the point. Then mark the point from which it comes out, and then tie your arm, and cut at the asil vein.
And beware of injuring the artery when you see it swollen, for it is an artery; avoid it then.
And if you see the blood from a chascun an arteries. Hurry up now, and put your two shoulders far apart, then twist them together often;
When the arm is joined together and left as it is, and let not move its painful limb, nor move it while it's still unhealed.
And if the joint doesn't move, and it gives relief, and there's no medication for you now, then open the artery if it has opened because of the contraction of its head; and pull out the joint again.
And take a strip of linen, and apply it, and take one-half of the piece and place it well against the other side today.
If the joint is not moving, that's good; if not, then treat it as we have previously mentioned, using powders that stiffen blood.
And pulling on the bandages is not done in any other positions concerning the small area around the wound or the possession of the two arms.
The surgical procedure in this environment assists by treating bleeding from the top of the vein and within the heart itself. because it's composed of the base and cranial (related to head) elements, as we have previously stated.
and it's essential for the surgeon that he watches over the nerve within, and if there is excessive pressure applied, then he will have to deal with the nerve again. and it swells up and its healing is hindered, perhaps not able to fully recover.
and this nerve opens frequently, and if it doesn't open in any home due to its subtlety, then it's necessary that you treat the wound with surgical instruments again; and avoid manipulating the nerve altogether.
And if there's a vein between those two nerves, then make it long.
The cranial part of this procedure helps to draw blood from the topmost point and assist with its management or draining.
and it's essential to pull on the olive branch or the thorn, as it's safe from all wounds, because there is no nerve nor artery within it.
Andrey leu auce de cestroveinne:il : And by chance it swells some people's limbs; however, the first time is not necessary to cause any pain. The quality of health depends on your thinking.
The first thing you need to know about medicine is that it's not meant only for keeping people healthy, but also for healing.
And to prevent illnesses from occurring; And medicine is performed in one of these three ways: cephalic (head-first), fistula (a surgical opening), and basilic vein (large superficial vein) procedures. And if medicine is needed when beginning to eat again after fasting, and in the morning and wintertime when signs of fullness appear.
And if medicine is needed within the first day or two, after 2-3 hours or 2-3 days.
Medicine which is applied does not have a predetermined time for addressing illness but rather when there is need due to day or season—throughout all hours and in every month.
and does not require medicine for children just under twelve years old or women who are less than four months pregnant—up until the seventh month. And should not be healed those who have passed 60 years.
And when anyone wishes to heal themselves, however it may be done, if it must involve administering a laxative enema. if there is much food retained, so that the vessels draw out superfluous substances to prevent them from being harmful to the main members of the body.
and should not heal those who are too full of meats, or who are drunk, whether it be so.
and if medicine is needed after colic pain, vomiting, flowing stomachs, multiplicity of births in women, and to labor, and when healing or from any wound.
Then subtly remove the humours, if they are not too large, by foods and drinks and medicines, if you have any.
And then in bathing, if nothing obstructs, for subtly draining the blood.
and keep healthy above the vein as well as in its third part, just as we have said before;
and keep that day free from work, prayer, pleasure, and similar things;
and then lay down and sleep, and be more healthful than those whom we have said to heal; and let the friction of his arm take place once or twice (for instance, three times).
then stretch the cord above a little bit because when it is too tight or few times, he cannot correct it without.
and then rub his hands where the veins swell, and smell them;
and then wet the strip of a little oil with some water, then place his right hand under that vein slightly above its normal position for a bit or until he feels it to be more relaxed. so that the vein does not fail from the injury. For they have veins that flee like cords from the healthful; and if there are such as are pleasant to wind. but when it meets the warmth of the flaime, if there is withdrawal from that warmth, and he cannot open the vein, then in this way are they.
and if it overlooks the vein, if it is too narrow, for this reason, so that they must be warned in these matters.

And if his hair is grown long, and the patient's pain intensifies, let him leave it for one or two years, and not bind the arm anymore. By chance an abscess may come up in his foot; do not enter it with water or bath, but if he finds it pleasing, start the sanitation again.
And if the puncture is small, or you cauterize it subtly and doubt that there will not be as much blood as you have seen, then carefully handle your own puncture with all due diligence.
And it is better done quickly at first so that the hair grows long and even; because this often happens when the wound is small.
If you see the joint swollen, do not restart the sanitation again, and place a small amount of oil on it; because it lightens the blood flow in the wound, and turns the same oil into that which is found in this joint.
And in this way, you should administer the oil after each sanitation to the veins, for it helps maintain the blood flow.
And this often causes trials and troubles when placed upon the joint; if it is applied subtly and removed when too large.
And if he comes with big abscesses that often occur, immediately when only the opening of the vein has been made and it is small. If you hurry up, and place the damp sponge soaked in water on the joint and heat it slightly for an hour.
And it is essential to perform this after the blood flow from the vein has stopped, and if it does not return to its place again after any days or months without discoloration. Etienne deffend laurainte. C’sans leu lesse desengles defface leu:ca vaillance à l'anfie desorme deffect.
nce toup. Now make sure you do not put anything of what we have said on it, for there may be a chance that without the artery; but I made an emplaster to harden the wound, and then treat it with other treatment until it is healed.
And for each kind of blood according to its quantity and color.
For if the blood is black, let it come out so that it remains red; and if you see large amounts of it, let it remain until it becomes thin; and if it's too hot, let it cool down.
And it is required of those who are weak and full-grown, and have the practice of bloodletting, because this makes them more prone to a larger wound, and their fever becomes wider.
And for the weak one, do the opposite, and make him healthier and stronger often; and he should be healthier when cutting in a different direction, not by pricking.
And this way of healing is safe from the runny blood and nerve swelling, and it's better than long or wide bleeding.
And for those whose blood is needed for healing, it must be given a little bread soaked in grape juice; if they are chilled, let him bleed two or three times, which amounts to four.
And if he has a cold complexion, then wash him with the little bread soaked in honey syrup; or honey syrup with aromatic spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and dried fruits, and well-scented syrup.
And if his hand has the bleeding, after letting out some blood, he must inhale strong ale and drink subtly scented syrup.
And use other things that we have mentioned in the section on syncope for the evacuation of veins.
And if he wants to vent his arms and heal again later, when he is greatly weakened by the bleeding, it must be done gradually according to the continuous quantity of its virtue.
And who wants to vent his arms after the first bleeding, and has strong blood, he should heal for seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the second hour.
And who wants to heal in another place, then it must be done within two days or three days.
Because there is much blood inside the body that has been chilled, and it brings fever; he must bleed a large quantity and enlarge the wound so that it starts to drip. Then you must fulfill all the bleeding conditions, and put your hand on his chest when he is healing so that the wound does not grow with fumes. And this happens many times when healers neglect it.
And it is not required when you saw it pulling the arm, and bleed blood again, and the wound is closed, then apply pressure therein. But if he's a donkey, extend his right arm quickly, for it would be harmful.
Butte au seigneur li sont du malis. and places underneath one thread of air, and presses lightly on the wound.
And if the vein has burst, let it be left alone and not squeezed, until the abscess is calmed down.
And if there is a need to remove blood again from the second time, let it be drained in that vein where it is, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein enters the elbow from the main vein because it is composed of it.
And the method of drainage is such that the patient places his hand in warm water until the phlebitis becomes red.
then tied loosely, so that the vein will be well visible, now the blood is removed across a thin and short path.
and if the puncture is wide, or well positioned near the joint of the hand, and it does not drain on its own, then put the hand back into warm water, and leave the blood in the water until you have enough.
and if it is so that you should not put your hand back into warm water, because it will be more in the air than in the wound.
and the drainage of this vein is safer from all other veins, since it has neither an artery nor a nerve.
The drainage of the hand's wrist is valuable for all types of liver diseases, and it is as follows:
Strain the hand and put it into warm water so that the vein becomes visible if you can see it. and if you drain it across its entire length without any complications.
and don't press too much on it because all arteries are cut from the shoulder downwards.
and then put it back into warm water if it doesn't freeze in the wound, and you cannot drain any more blood from there.
And when you have drained the blood so much as one would do with expertise, put oil and thread on the vein to close it up quickly, and then continue doing this for each bleed.
The drainage in the left hand is valuable for treating mouse disease (presumably referring to thrombophlebitis of the great saphenous vein) and you do everything as I have described for the right hand.
The sickness of Sophia is valued for all diseases that affect the body. Like these illnesses of the marsh, and retention of flowers, and rain disease, and arthritis, and old legs, and similar ailments.
And the quality of her sickness is that she endures hot water poured on her body and friction applied to the veins until they bleed. And above that hot spot; and the vein is at the ankle, and much rainwater flows from it.
Her sickness then becomes wider rain or at the ankle, where it moves.
And if you heal her with the hot spot, then take for it the arrows that are inside, and heal her sickness like in extracting them; and sometimes there is swelling.
And if he cannot come out from it, then put back the hot spot in hot water, and let the vein drain well.
And if her sickness needs it the first time, then repeat the second time above a little bit, because its salt is there. Do not doubt the nerve, as we have said, and therefore also do with Sophia's sickness the same on another spot equally.
The vein in the popliteal is at the knee joint strong, and her sickness values the pain of the backache when it is hot with blood.
And the quality of her sickness is that she has pain between bathing and it stretches above the knee joint four times in twisting.
because otherwise it does not open; and if it opens, heals her sickness in all ways that you can, including crossing. and it is worth that you extract her, because the vein is swollen, and she is quite restored to herself at home.
and it is worth that you extract her, because the vein is swollen, and she is quite restored to herself at home. And if you do not extract her, then heal none of the arrows from that hot spot or on the back side of it, and take out some of them.
and doctors it such that you see blood, and then straighten the ligaments, and put on cotton thread, and holds them fast now she is healed.

Ventouse is made of horns, or leather, or reeds; and suction is done according to various methods: either by piercing and drawing out blood, or by cutting with a sharp object.
And this suction done through cutting is according to various methods: either it is at full heat, or by the application of fire.
And in two more sides of the neck, and the suction device is positioned over the chin. And the suction on the hands; and the suction on the wrists. And the suction on the arms; and the suction on the legs. And the suction on the feet; and this suction does not treat blood, as it consists of fine threads spread over the surface.
And for that reason no one can deny, just as we do with veining. And it does not mean that she must be subjected to heat or fire in any disease caused by excess, as long as all the veins are opened and drained.
And if there is a necessity for suction due to illness or customs, we administer it every hour at the beginning of the month, at the end, and in between each week.
because there are such people who, when they need suction, weigh heavily.
and to others who experience fullness and hardening in their body, head, neck, and legs, and darkness in the eyes.
and there are some who experience a drop of blood in their mouth, have fled out tongue, and drained blood. Furthermore, there are those who think, and see with the sighted body blood-stained and swollen veins and joints, and similar manifestations.
And when we observe these signs, immediately after the month's end, our orders are to perform venesection two days later at the hour of the day.
The method of the medicine helps in loosening the head's weight ... which comes from the eyes, and it does not require that this be after the evacuation of all the veins.
And this suction on the cephalic aspect of the health:

And for this reason it does not suffice that the vigilance is needed in such cases, nor those who have cold or feverish diseases.
And those who recover often become blinded, and for this reason one must place the suction device slightly further down due to doubt of effectiveness.
The suctioning removes the neck vein from its place in the center of health and pilgrimage sites, and for this reason it is worth doing to prevent rupture. and the crack of the channel where pressure is applied, and suctioning, and filling.
and it must be pressed slightly, for if it holds too tightly, there may be a lack of effectiveness or issues with the stomach and heart.
The suctionings of the two neck veins are worth great pain in the head, and inflammation, and strangulation, and pain at the roots of the teeth.
and it is in the center of the pilgrimage site; and it instructs the priest to command him that he expresses his hand when placing the device, so that he does not choke on an artery, nor bleed profusely.
The suctioning of the mouth is worth disease of the mouth and gum decay, and similar illnesses that are in the mouth; it is also in the center of the pilgrimage sites for both lips.
The suctioning of the shoulders is worth diseases that arise from heat and filling (presumably referring to edema).
The suctioning of the veins is worth just as much as three arrows in each arm. because it draws blood from these large veins.
and commands the priest not to inflict too much pain on him, for his head is bare of hair, and he knows inside there are veins and arteries.
The suction device that is placed on the back is worth cysts and diseases in the area, and it instructs that the suction must be large and rough, so that it can do its job well; and perhaps if it were subtle, it would break; and it causes great wounds.
The suction devices applied to the legs are worth great pain in all parts of the body, and they are equivalent to old rains, marriages, and bladder pain; and they weaken the strength of both feet, and bring about multiple states (of health).

And if it is large, it can cause an injury to do two times: the first time to gently open the path of the thick blood.
And if it is very deep, it must cause an injury to do three times; and when we bleed the thick blood a little bit at a time, we simply have done once enough.
And if we take much blood, we often reseep; and if it is very deep, they pierce again and finish so that the wound is firmly closed.
and must to those who have thick skin and hardened veins, that you oil the hairs of their suction cups with appetizing and dissolving oil. if it is so, of violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or seed cucumber oil.
and if it is in water, of watercress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if there is an excess of thick and cold blood, take bitter oil, or balm oil, or anet seed oil, and similar things.
And if that person who is healthy has tender veins and wide pores, it does not need to be put any oil.
but it must be washed after the suction with clear water, or cold water, or water of mulberry tree, or watercress oil, or cucumber oil, or something similar.
And those who have much humidity must be raised with silk, or water of myrtle, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have excessive thick blood must be raised with strong wine, or water of the sweet flag, or anet decoction, or chamomile decoction, or other things.
and they do not need to be raised with suction before or after bathing, but an hour afterwards; and they do not sleep again after the suction.
and must that he wear when it is necessary to be suctioned and when he is humid. And those who are choleric should also wear, and if the vein is too hot and inflamed. and must that he have cold things to eat, like pears and endive leaves and lettuce with silk; and similar things.
and lamb's blood, and marrow of the femur, and moist meats.
and those who have cold complexions must eat honey syrup, aromatic wine that is between young and old, and drink a little bit of goat's milk, and goat's blood and small birds' blood and small fowl's blood.

And it requires giving to some people sometimes cathartic or musk before the windings, or after, in order to strengthen the main limbs. And he must be taken out gently but it does not require those who drink hot fluids.
The suction cups that are placed on the wounded areas are those put on the liver, and on the joints, and gouty arthritis, and on the stomach, abdomen, bladder, and hernia, because these body parts do not suffer pain under them or elsewhere.
And it is not done that in order to draw blood from a limb with another limb. As we apply to the breasts when the child does not feel pain; in order to reduce the viscosity of the member, as we apply suction cups to the stomach and bladder to diminish the limb.
And he will have pain when there is an operation or incision, if by its attractive power the operation causes injury to the joint's socket.
And this is done when it is placed on the liver and joints where there has been retained windiness.
And these vacuum cups are administered as empty to draw out so much fluid; and sometimes they are administered in combination with fire, and at other times with ice.
And in such cases as with excessive coughing, and in this way the suction cup is filled with hot water or with heated medicinal herbs that are known to help for this condition.
The form of the suction cup administered by fire is such that...
And it should be two and a half palm wide and have an edge that goes into the socket .i. small hole, as if to push in a needle.
And it is of rainwater or saliva before putting the member in its place, so that the malady does not bleed when placed on the limb.
And it should have a millstone-shaped form in the middle of water or iron, to hold an ingot placed upon it.
And there are times. 1ere partie du ventouse, et la chacun. ouns desuilles ainsures d'estre un journe:
For children's suction cups are different from old people, and thin ones are unlike fat ones.
And should one put this suction cup onto the limb?
Take up a candlestick or such similar object, and place it between the arm which has the suction cup. So that the light be at the base of the suction cup, so it does not burn the patient.
And then you put it onto the limb, and you must place it in the hole that we have mentioned, so that when they see it, if there is a flow of vapor, let them remove the suction cup.
And take up the object if you have practiced, and repeat it often if you are experienced.
As the suction cup which is used in treating pleurisy at any age does not have a vein or vessel and is applied to the limb only when it is free from fever.
And this is its form:
Suction cups are not used in small areas where they can be placed for the little things, like lips and teeth, and similar things. And in them being drawn out of the flesh like ours or others, etc.,
And the quality of its use is that when you remove suction cups from areas with moist or sticky exudate without any feeling, they must be removed.
And you put it in warm water softly, provided they are free of discomfort and have no internal issues. And then be skilled in the art of using a suction cup and its application, apply it to the limb as long as it is red, and put the suction cups on.
And when they become smooth, and let them be, for it is proper to put the suction cup after such condition.

And if his hair is too long after the removal of wounds from the limb, and place on it a wet sheet of linen, cold water, and put it so that the wound remains swollen.
And if the wounds are numerous, place on them powdered glass or galls and similar things, so long as they remain swollen.
Or place on the joint somewhat of heated flour, and let them harden in the joint, if it will stay now.
And if you have more experience, take other wounds.
And if the wounds do not stop bleeding, rub the joint with fresh blood, or pierce it with a needle until the swelling goes down. and then put them on again, so that they harden as soon as they feel the blood.
And when you see them oozing, sprinkle a little aloe and sand or ashes on them, so they will stop now.
This marks the beginning of the book of dislocations
This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and it includes treatment for dislocation and repair.
Slice through the book, as it is said by those who have never seen this chapter in any of the ancient books or letters.
And for this reason is the advancement of science in our land, as I found none better;
And I know nothing about it because of the ancient books and sciences that I studied so much that I understood their knowledge, as well as through experience and practice in my life.
And I have described in this chapter what is contained herein, and summarized at the end, and I have clearly shown the forms of injuries that are to be treated as I have done in these two preceding chapters.
Now it is necessary that we say in this prologue of this book the sums of words and chapters or where he places his understanding, and delay on the page, so that those who have tried can see and learn this noble art, and they will teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or displacement has no connection to it implies that you must immobilize the malady on one side and the other side as well, since nothing can completely cure if even a slight injury is present, whether in terms of weakness, fever, or old age.
If it is not too cold or too freezing; and one must avoid consuming frozen foods, such as ice, bird feathers, and horse fat (and drink no wine nor eat any greasy foods), and not overfill the body with meats that fill up veins until there is doubt about anaplasia or expansion of material in a limb, then one must return to the previous governance he has used.
And when the bone is broken it must begin to restore, and one should not feed the patient with foods that produce much noise or have viscosity, as if wheat cooked in water, and rye, and testicles, and pies of various kinds, and pork, and oats, and fishes, and strong wine, and similar things. Because much noise indicates that the bone is more quickly healed.
And you must understand that a broken bone of the old and weak cannot be properly repaited or joined according to its nature due to the degeneration of limbs, nor those who are too tender like small children.
But do not cure it, resetting the broken bone by using strong bands that join the limb together, as long as it was before; and do not feed him all his work with such foods, for we have said this before.
And you must understand that there are various ways it may be.

For there is also a break which goes around an arrow, and another when sharpening, as we have seen with the cutting of a pen to write. And if there is a crack accompanied by a wound, and a crack in one small groove.
And in each manner has its methodology^2, and its specific instrument for restoration, according to what recollection comes upon it.
and it is the break of bone by reason that its marrow is twisted^3, and it opens well afterward, and one presses with his hand.
and if there is no twistiness in it yet again, and the maladies do not feel much pain either, then there is no break.
but it may well have twistiness, or a crack, or small break. And it does not signify that you should move him with the hand, but to apply medicaments which come after this point^4, and then restrain gently now.
And you know that the break which goes around an arrow, and its .ij parts joined together^5, he must now set them equally, so that when arrows strike again.
and when arrows fall on him, if his limbs are not hurt in the event of their falling, he must then be at rest. Then place the arrow on the muscle so that you can move it lightly and slightly, and know that the restoration of this is easier than any other restorations of them or those where there are pieces; then tighten, as it requires after.
And if the bone in the foot is broken into pieces, whether it requires .ij. (two) parts, whether it's hands or tendons, or one small limb, or two strings, or a string and to your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural shape, if when both sides of a broken member are displaced, you restore them all by pressing with various instruments that you can move on it so that through your work the patient's injury and pain do not worsen.
and fit well the two broken bone pieces according to the best shapes.
And you feel it's well in your hand if it seems that it is not doing so good: if the drawing believably changes somewhat, and do not tighten it too much; don't press as they do by their practice of piercing and contraction to the limb, as we have experienced many times.
And when the limb is at rest, if you manage well your malady so it does not move, wake up from sleeping, turn around, or in any other way. and watch well that the limb is secure so it does not feel any pain. For when there is no pain, it's not necessarily so, and he must put in such a situation that he does not feel any pain.
For when there is no pain, it's not necessarily so, and he must put in such a situation that he does not feel any pain. and keep that it is placed straightly so twists don't occur when he has been restored;
and the quality of the broken member is according to what I have told you.
And you know that the broken members are various in small size and great magnitude, and form.
And there are small members, which is about to be wrapped up delicately in linen cloth.
il. Aelong.
Then the limb is twisted severely, either two or four turns depending on the joint, and hold your hand slightly throughout the entire process, then go above the break and loosen it less than before, until the break moves away a little from that spot.
and slightly loosen the joint a few times until you have achieved a large part of healing in that spot, then turn one other joint towards the broken joint;
then return to the area around the breakage, and loosen it gradually, not too much nor too little, as we have said in the first line above.
then place linen or other bandages between the twisted joints as long as they remain levelled, then bind one limb with another bandage and if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or abscess, then apply something soothing to the area that relieves the swelling and supports the affected joints, allowing it some time to recover without further intervention.
then apply the bandages tightly, and use either a wide strip of linen for repositioning or wood from which to make stakes, or strips of leather, in accordance with this shape.
but there must be a larger piece of material placed over the break, which is slightly bigger and broader than the other pieces used in wrapping or support.
and it should also be long enough, as is required by the size of the limb, whether small or large.
then apply the bandages similarly to how you did in the first part of this procedure, and tie them up securely with an available cord, as was done above near the fracture.
more tightly applied now, then looser again; and it is essential that the cord used be of fine linen thread, neither too thick nor too thin.
for if the rope used is too thick, as I have seen in works that twist linen cord so badly, and it's a great mistake, because the wrappings cannot be uniform unless there are less than two spaces between each set of bandages.
And if the patient has severe pain from the nails after stripping out the healthy ones, then lay them with linen soaked or rags torn that they do not cut.
When the wound is with rupture and the skin tears, I will tell you the treatment afterwards.
And it does not require pulling out all torn nails on the first day of bruising. For when the limbs are large, it does not require placing nails there immediately after 5 or 6 years of healing, or more according to your discretion as long as caution in performing the procedure is maintained.
and here the ancient method for restoring fractures, dislocations, and torsions: and it is that you take flour held in the walls of a millstone, mix it with plenty of water, make this concoction neither too clear nor too thick, use it, and it is the common method of restoring fractures to various conditions, especially for women and children, because it's not too hot or harsh.
Another method of emplasting to restore fractures and dislocations: take waxes, oils, and gum myrrh and musk; 10 grams of each; rose water and aloe five times as much; seven grains of Alecitha [Alecithus cerasinus]; make powder with honey, if the patient's condition is warm, use this plaster, for it has good composition, restores bone fractures swiftly, and is valuable to many people.
Another method of emplasting for torsion: take myrrh and waxes; 10 grams each; rose water and aloe seven times as much; six grains of Acacia [Acacia nilotica]; nine Armenian bole [Armeniaca vulgaris], and grind well, mix with water or plenty of honey, and apply.
Another method of emplasting to address dislocated joints and loose teeth: take new linen, mix it with milled grain and cooked oil, put it on the affected area. This plaster doesn't restore fractures or dislocations, but is beneficial for easing pain from sudden movement, and properly addresses dental pains.
Another method of emplasting to restore broken bones: take dried fig leaves and wild celery leaves; grind them together, make a plaster.
Another method of emplastrement to the bone fractures and for shorten: prouinanze: "lere, et siens les cesturant l'amaince tienne de la peice in êtes maryse. Leuzeepe :"sence, enle sance of aneanapostrophe d’esme :gathure eslaine le meaustractrede "daunder itineration. The Oldenglish theude deur:meanwhile.
Another way to emplastre more than the first, when aspirating comes to restoring the limb. Take roots of willow, and seeds of linen, beam, little beech, and without sulfur, and violet flowers and chamomile from all kinds, a part of one; and grind, and conserve with salt water or sweet water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb and its rest.
In his book, Ypocrates mentions that for repairing a broken limb, only wax and oil are used, and nothing else more; and he says it should be neither too soft nor too hard, but rather between two extremes.
And it seems to him that one should put on the broken limb things slightly warm, similar to myrrh and aloe and incense and other like things as we have mentioned.
Another way to emplastre that is worth for injury and pain: take mugwort and chervil of cut men or bird feathers, and willow roots equally, and grind them, and make an emplastre with the limb.
And then he should slightly move the dislocation afterwards, and take care that there is no more of his severe pain, nor does it affect the joint of its place again; if not done by hand day after day.
And if pain comes to the joint, or itching, rest, dislocate the emplastre now; and take a silk cloth, and dip it in moist sea water, and immerse the limb in water, and lift up the limb as long as the itch subsides, and make the pain alleviated. then let the limb rest for an hour, and put it on linen dry, moistened with rose water or oil, and tie it tightly above the joint until you are certain that aspiration has ceased.
and let the inflammation of the limb be soothed, then make the pain alleviated again, and gently start repositioning the emplastre, and a little more emplastre, and do not force it as before; gradually until it is sound.
And if you see that aspiration and spasms and pain and swelling are returned to the entire limb, and you have been taught emplastre and tying, then redo it as you did initially.
And if there is no return of the same issues that we have mentioned in the limb, dislocate it again after 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 days, depending on what you see, as long as the breakage continues, and approaches the previous adjustment to the joint above.
however the restraint should be more than initially, and its flesh swells as I said before; if you see that the limb is dried out more than it should be, it shows that there are no chances for recovery. arise the decoctions of warm water every time you dislocate it, and do so for each day, and slightly loosen the emplastre.
through these works so-called "cunts" for pain; et sanc jor depresure en laine penselez li unques en cestot drapes, leu ainsens lache, carre cesturnece est maladresse.
saint:nage. Many methods of fractures exist, and various forms, and their causes are distinguished.
because there are breaks made by sword blowing, and the bone shatters all along its length as it is hit or struck, hence this type of break is called "haichure".
or the sword strikes the bone with excessive force, and this type of break is called "absolute," and it results in these large or small wounds.
And if it has been struck with an impaled weapon, or chiseled bone, or fall from a stone, or other similar occurrences.
And if there is a persistent break, which affects the tissue both within and around the bone, or it lies on top of the bone, and this wound may be large or small in nature.
And if the wound is repaited into the bone with such subtlety as to be comparable to hairline fractures, and it is these small breaks that are referred to as "capillary" fractures.
and if the wound is caused by piercing with an iron object, or from a fall, or something similar, causing pieces of bone to enter inside, and it resembles the heat treatment of a blacksmith when they fire at hot irons; where there are fragments within the bone.
And this happens more often to those who have wet bones, as with children's bones.
and it occurs in all these types of fractures where small fragments are embedded, as if they were there; and I will speak about this on its surface.
And we know all ways of fractures due to erosion on them, and the investigation with tents, and by the corroded one that is on top of it.
The hair-like appearance is known because when the bone is discovered and scraped over it, if a black crack appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, take care of any bad effects from the patient, and if you see no malicious accident, as vomiting blood, loss of consciousness, stretching, swelling of palms, high fever, veins bursting and reddening, and other various dispositions, where there is doubt about healing.
And if there is an unavoidable accident, and you hope for salvation, it begins the treatment.
And when the patient arrives first at you, and it is winter, it must be set the bone before the fourteenth day so that you can do it.
And if it is in the spring, if you delay setting the bone before the seventh day so that the skin over the bone becomes corroded, then those accidents we have mentioned come about.
And if the bone fracture occurs just as it covers the skull, then you must cut into that part: and see to protecting the head of the patient who is in great pain, and examine the bone from all angles that you can do so, and on the surface of the wound that is more swollen than usual.

And then there is another treatment greater than the first one.
And the second method is if you have various treatments, some narrow and others wide, with pointed ends and made of iron; and done lightly so as not to bruise the head.
And if the bone is hard and tough, it must be pierced through at least one tendon so that treatments are applied with tender care, ensuring they do not penetrate beyond the bone's cartilage; and you must have more than these, so that each part of the bone receives attention from its end to its edge; and it requires three forms of tender care:
The quality of piercing through the bone requires you to apply tender care on the bone itself, then turn it back until you confirm that the bone has been penetrated; afterward, place the tendernited in a different area nearby, and proceed thoroughly around the bone, then use the incisors at the interval between the pierced points, doing so more subtly than we've mentioned before, lightly as required, until you bring the bone back to your hand or one of your tools such as tongs, pincers; and ensure that nothing touches the brain or skull.
And once the bone has been pierced and treated, it is required that you reshape the insertion point which takes time from the bone to any other seemingly similar instrument to an incisor, but it requires it to be more tender and subtle than the other incisors.
and if it doesn't involve any small bones or fragments, handle the bone lightly with your tools; then treat the wound with tenting and ointments as we have described.
And the other work of operation that is known by Greeks as 'causewaying,' which they strongly asserted and it's their word. It requires first that you discover a part of the bone, where the break is open and exposed; once discovered, place the lens-shaped incisor at the top of this section, as it has the following form:
And do not cut from one side only, but divide the part into two angles so that the cutting is directed towards the bone; then hit with a small hammer on top of it lightly, going all around the bone and taking care not to damage the surface underneath.
if it is attached to the bone, handle it gently because the bone can easily suffer harm and pain.
And if the bone'e is not pierced through the surface, and the pieces are small; it requires a rough treatment and tenderly remove the fragments from a sharply delicate razor, and you must have varied amounts of it, so that each piece can be treated in every part most accessible according to the operation and shape of the break.

In each of the other hair cuts and subtle fractures, it is necessary that you prepare according to its nature; and this is something that is not returned to those who have studied in this art.
And if the wound is discovered, it is necessary that you first apply a piece of linen according to the size of the wound, and moisten it with rose oil, and place it on the wound. Then apply another doubled linen or twofold or threefold, and moisten it with wine and rose oil, and place it on top of the first one; do this more lightly than you can so as not to strain the wound, then slightly dampen above it with another piece of linen, and don't pull too hard until only the surface of the wound is stained.
And leave it for one or two days until the abscess is reduced, then remove it, and administer remedies as roots of lilac, and flour, and powdered incense, and alchemical preparations, and similar things; make pills from these medicines and apply them to the wound, and afterwards administer further medicine that soothes biting.
And ensure that the wound is cleaned so as not to leave any residue or bandage still on it, because when a thorn gets stuck underneath the scalp, it can cause corrosion and inflammation; and when something sharp is placed on the wound without restraint, it can cause great harm. Because when you place something biting on the wound excessively.
Therefore take care so that if any misfortune befalls you, as we have said before, it is doubtful in such cases.
And if no harm comes but from the medicine that has been applied to it, there is a need for you to apply some honey, and three parts of rose oil, and cover it with a piece of linen; then place these on the wound. And the method of treatment that he can manage, as long as he is healthy.
Remember that the two joints above or solely without one next to another are never broken at once, because they are bone-like; and these inside are cartilaginous, and don't break either by pulling or twisting, and then healed.
And if one of the two joints is broken, it is necessary for you to make an incision on either side or in the joint itself and place that fracture inside your index finger tip, and then put a bandage there until it regains its natural shape. And do this lightly, and make sure that the patient does not feel pain from your intervention.
And if the fracture is above the joint and it cannot be placed on the bed, then you must put a small piece of iron at the top of one end of a stick.
And if the break is of two parts, then repair it again, and hurry to restore it within a few days, if you can do so.
However, after the seventh or tenth attempt to soothe the abscess opening, when the pressure on the two knots of linen is relieved, then try attaching a double layer of linen bandage if the fracture consists of one part.
Or you bind another part if the fracture spans across it; and make the bandages thick enough to fill in the indentations of the knots.
And the restorers say that the bandages must be soaked in bear's fur, and renewed every day. I don't think this is well-founded; however, they should be moistened with bear fat and powder of flour, then leave the dressing in place until the bone hardens and the cartilage becomes firm.
And never should one pour oil onto the edges of the bandages, and if there is such a soft cloth underneath, and the abscess remains open, then blow away the patient's pus among them; or let the knee that you see guide your actions.
And if the abscess opening approaches near to where you work, then put cauterium or cotton soaked in rose oil, or a little of diaphoretic medicine inside it.
And if the abscess opening does not appear, then pack it with fine wheat flour and powdered frankincense, mixed with bear fat, placed under heavy weights, without securing the edges of the bandage.
And if the two knots of bandage are small and broken into fine pieces, then treat them with suitable medications for such fractures, open up the split, and address various dislocations and sprains, and join it together as one would treat similar bandages soaked in medicinal ointments.
And if there is no wound in the two knots of bandage, then continue with the treatment for abscesses and place linen pads on it until healed.
from the treatment procedure of the jawbone
And if the jawbone is not broken, and it has no fractures, and are not to be broken, so as much, and knowe well that this shall be known in tesmect it of munueture de la mandibre en espris, et si li choses.

And if the fracture of the jawbone is displaced in .ij., it requires that you apply a partial extension by .ij. so long as it remains level.
And if the displacement of teeth occurs, or rotation, when they are tightened with an iron or silver thread or silk thread, place it under the fractured jawbone and put a double linen cloth on it; and place that linen cloth over it a well-made stretcher, or a piece of leather long and wide according to the jawbone, and let him lie down as you command, and direct the patient to rest, and feed them with light foods.
And if you observe that the figure changes, let it lie for a month, and then reposition accordingly; and place powdered flour with an abundance of fine wheat or millet on it after dressing the tooth; and put thin linen over the powder, and when the linen dries out, do not change the patient's disposition, let them rest so long as they are sound, many times healed in three months.
And if abscesses arise, let it be as we have said many times before.
And if it has a fracture and open wound together, provide only the fragment of bone in which it is lodged; if it's so delicate that you cannot obtain it with forceps.
And if the wound is narrow, expand it with moisture according to its necessity.
And when you have all these pieces set and there's no delay in doing so, if the wound is wide, and put on them moistened cauteries suitable for bandaging tightly until it heals.
from the forceps The forceps break it more times in front of the shoulder, and the fracture is according to two manners: or it's broken and displaced at .ij., and there are pieces, and it is lighter to restore; or it has a fracture with wound.
And the works are when the fracture is felt in the wound, you have two needles, so that one strikes the shoulder that feels broken; and the other extends the col towards the part; then make equal the break at your place, so it forms as it should, and has no appearance nor healing.
And if you need to extend further, place a round piece of cloth or linen on the patient's shoulder, depending on your necessity; and soften the forceful part, and hold back the piece with your hand, so that the break is made evenly as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the chief of the cautery away due to it being hot, then it is required that the broken arm be placed on soft bedding, and place one shoulder brace over each shoulder; and position the needles along the shoulder blade, until the bones of the forceful part are raised.
And then place the break at your place, and if you feel debris on it, it is required that you fracture underne Written in Old French during the medieval period. The text appears to be related to medical practices, specifically cautery and treatment of dislocations or fractures:
and it seems like a spoon, and is not sharp, and it should also be as wide as it needs to be, according to the size of the bone and your skill; and have two needles, one large, like you see fit, and the other thinner, just as required for the groove in the wound that you created when treating the bones.
and when you are sure of the incisions, if there is a wound, and if the groove created is small, or you doubt an incision, then cover the wound with linen cloths and tenting according to its size.
And if incisions appear due to the wetness of the wound, then anoint with one linen cloth soaked in oil and hemp, and place it there.
The dislocation of the bone, when it is felt in the wounds and has been set, requires you to place an arrowhead made of powdered millstone and peat around the bone, positioning several layers over it, and put a round piece undernee if you have learned. Then take a very large band of one palm in width, then place two heavy stakes above it, and tie it up; then take a slender stick of three feet wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage so that the head of the bandage remains hanging. And place the stick above the fracture, and turn the bandage around its neck, and under the healthy shoulder, and under the malformed one; and ramp up each part, and when you see that the bandage holds firmly to the fracture, and clearly you can see that the stick does not move above the bone, then repair it every day, and when the ligaments loosen, so keep a tight restraint.
And make the patient lay on his back, and place a small roll under the bandage while he sleeps; this will help to elevate the shoulder restraint by aligning the spine, or you can tie the arm to the collarbone, so that no malformation occurs in the next twenty years.
Then resume the bandaging, if you see that it needs to be done, and keep the restraints and bandages on until they are restored; this should last up to twenty-seven years at most for humans.
from the fracture of the shoulder
It is rare that the fracture of the shoulder or arm does not heal on its own and there are no complications due to touch; if you set it according to the shape of the fracture and bandage accordingly, in all ways you can do it. Then place a little powder with some cotton wool on one strap under two light straps, and tie them under the wide stick. Then place another wider stick over that, so that there is no movement at any point of the shoulder joint, and cover the hairy area with linen so that the stick looks identical; then tightly bandage it all around so that it does not move from its position, and observe the patient every day; whenever he moves or feels pain, loosen the bandage and make sure the stick still fits if it is loose, and lie him down on his side. And when these numbers are reached, release him and be careful because this is no longer a bone that can move freely.
And if a piece of the bone is displaced above and below its original position, then place it back, and treat the bone, and do what we have said in the treatment of an abscessed joint to alleviate the fracture.
from the second fracture
The piece of bone is rarely displaced in the middle, but it can happen; however, it often shifts to the side, and he feels severe pain there, as well as weakness elsewhere, and sometimes vomits blood, and opens up in the fractured bones, and his sensation is quite bad.

Of the dislocation of the shoulders
Dislocations of the shoulders do not occur merely due to their large weight on top of the back and in the chest area, but also because they are moist, and he feels well with this examination.
And the resetting should be to put back in place the dislocation, as it requires; and then apply a splint, if you have experience with that.
And if the dislocation of the shoulders is declining in the middle, he feels great pain and nausea, similar to pleurisy because the bone points at a thread; and also vomits blood and spits up large quantities of sputum, which is very serious illness, and they used great effort to treat it.
And if there are those who say that he should administer foods that swell the stomach to push back the dislocation. (Note: This part of the text may be a bit anachronistic as dietary advice is not typically associated with treating shoulder dislocations in medieval times, but it has been translated as requested).
We do not do such things; unless the abscesses grow, they will come on their own. (Note: This part also reflects a medical understanding from medieval times that may differ significantly from modern practices). And if it has come, if he is healthy.

Of the dislocation of the neck
Never does a dislocation occur in the neck bone, and it rarely happens that it flips; and also at the vertebrae of the back. And when this occurs in none at all, and you know whether it will heal or not, if your observation finds the hands softened and swollen and dead, and they cannot move nor extend; when you prick them with a needle, does it hurt? It is evident that it can be fatal to many conditions, and if it becomes quiet and feels well when restrained and held still, then know that the joint of the bone is safe, and the patient's illness will be cured, provided they receive treatment.
And if such symptoms occur in the vertebrae of the back, and you know whether it will heal or not; when observing that the spine bones are softened and there is an accident involving the hands, along with restlessness and involuntary movements at the back junctions - breathing and digestion without volition; and if observed upon pressing on his abdomen, it also shows voluntary excretion. And when he lies down on his back and wishes to sit up but cannot do so. This signifies that it is fatal: if there is no improvement in the treatment.
And if this incident does not happen, then it is a lesser matter.
And the treatment if it has an abscess, you should apply hot oil or lamb's fat oil on its vertebrae region, as long as it calms down; then place him on a comfortable supportive bed, and bind him with bandages; and command the patient to rest in that part where there is no pain until he recovers. And if any bone dislocates, it must be covered with the skin; and then set the bone, and assemble the two parts of the wound, if they are large, in a bandage, then cauterize it gently until healed; and when your shoulder joints are displaced, which is called "kowe", you take your left pocket hand, place it on the other (the right) as much as possible, then put an easel or a stand over it if necessary; then immobilize it, and apply treatment to the wound until healed.
And about a dislocation of the bone of the hock, indicating that it requires immediate and careful treatment due to its location's complexity, as the ankle joint might be subjected to significant stress or trauma. Addressing this injury demands attention from the healer; cauterize demention if the sauf invention, soignez lou hoc, et si se ne puise les poinz, et et siet li malades comant estes d'apres lait doux.
There happens seldom that the bone of the shoulder is broken, and if it does happen, there is only a slight reduction at the top; and lengthens much, and declines in the neck area, and comes to the malady pain at the site, and swelling where it breaks.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand over it as long as it's on the fracture; and recognize what kind of break and its shape; and if the break is at the top alone, place an equal one there so long as it remains naturally shaped.
And if the break is long or it descends inwards, then make the malady lie down on its belly until your restoration of that fracture has improved. And when you have placed the equal one, put it on a trestle or a beam of wood or iron, then bind the fracture so that it does not move; and occupy the area around the hips, until the leg is even again.
And command the malady to sleep on its healthy side or back.
And if the abscess comes out at the joint, do not touch it, so long as the abscess is calmed down, and put it on what we have previously mentioned; then return to restoration, and bind it in such a way that there are no further complications, which is the proper method.
from the dislocation of the shoulder joint
The shoulder joint is what lies between the shoulder blade and the top of the shoulder, and if it's dislocated, one must restore it according to one of these two methods: take a straight piece of wood about 10 cm long, with its end sharper than the rest; this method involves inserting the pointed end into the wound so as not to touch any bone.
And apply the same methods to the ligaments and arteries, pulling them upwards, then look at the malady on a chair; after that cut the dislocated arm on wood so it moves naturally, with one piece of wood under it, and then place it on anything light or heavy where the ministers can stretch it back as it should be. Then bind the fracture to its original position using both hands together, until the fracture returns in the way it ought.
And the other method is that they suppose the malady to be on its hammock, and bind it with the hand on its neck, then command some ministers that he burn those parts which are at his hands where the fracture is, and others along all his limb, and extend each part.

And if the armpit comes, do not restrain it for seven years, and place a soft bandage moistened with oil on both sides of it until the armpit is calmed; then restrain it, and in restraining it, make sure to apply the splint above the fracture, then bind the arm to the crutch, and put your hand on the shoulder or chest; and wrap the bandage, and restrain the crutch, and the arm so that the arm is upright without any obstruction, unless there is something preventing it or if the bone has not settled.
And if you doubt that the bone does not move, use sticks, and place a wider and stronger stick above the fracture, and put between each stick about one inch apart; make each stick so large that it passes over the fracture by three inches from each side; then restrain the sticks as I have said at the beginning of this chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less loosely.
And if you see the arrangement of sticks and restraining, as we have said, restore the broken limb; if you doubt whether the armpit will move again, let it remain tied for seven years, as we have said; then observe every three years that there is no swelling at the joint or lump growing to the skin, or the patient's pains come to the overly strained part. If this happens, if so we have said.
And if no such occurrence comes to pass within three years or more, and the patient lies on his back with his hands over his stomach; place in the sling an even piece of linen woven like that we have mentioned before, and watch every hour during each day for the misaligned broken limb not to move or become weak in its ligaments; if it is through the virtue of medicine and the meat given as we have previously stated, so that the meat be first subtle; and when he begins to recover, if it becomes heavy. And custom is that the sling and leg should be released and reinforced after forty years for all; and therefore the patient must be discharged and given baths and medicines with ointments for strengthening the limb. And if the restriction is ugly and swollen, then let it rest for one year or a couple of months.
from the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones called the "fusillade," with one being small enough to be called the little drumstick, which holds the quiver; and the other is large, known as the great drumstick, located near the smaller one. By chance, either the large or the small drumstick may break alone, or both together.

And if it is the great fire, then he must stretch it further; and extend on one side, and heat the pouch of the hand higher than others, and the small ones lower than others, and make his diseased crossings near to him himself, and that side of the cushion above itself more than its painful part; then stretch the ministers over to the affected part of his arm, or on one side, and other ministers on another higher. And then put him equal measures, according to their better form.
And if there is a fragment in pieces, put each piece to its place; and if there are no deformities preventing it from returning to its place, then do so with the surgeon, as we have said before.
And if there is an injury with the fragmentation, I have spoken to the individual surgeon; take up the care.
And if at the beginning of restoring the aposteme cavity it succeeds by applying a rosette made of olive oil and beeswax that is neither too hard nor too soft; then apply another thin drapelet, so as to ease the cavities until they are pacified. Then place the cerate on the mill' hammer with abundant powder mixed with honey, putting in place the estelles (or plaster casts), and make it larger than the others, at least two eyes wide apart: whether the fragment is embedded in one of the bones or both; and pull it more towards the fragment than any other part, as I have said to the individual surgeon at the beginning. And let the drapelets that are over the fragment be neither too hard nor too soft; and stretch out the filaments (or threads), made of linen, not too thick or thin, as we have previously mentioned. Then reward the member and its ligament after some time. And if any accident occurs to the member, as itching that occurs on the member, it must be that you warm the limb with hot water until those itches are pacified; and leave the member not too narrowly rested. Then resume the contraction, and if the ligaments are weakened and the bone has been displaced, as it happens, then address it.
And if the contractures cannot come to the member because they are too severe, it must be that you soften it a bit, and then let it remain for some time until those contractures have corrected themselves; then reapply the contraction.
And if these things that we have said do not come to the patient, for XX years; then release his hands at his collar, and let them be in shape, and watch over him movement and posture, and know this fracture. ce monde est li lains de lice a midaine, etes a dire on itre ofte encomply.
Of the dislocation of the hand
Seizes that on the back of the hand and we often experience few fractures, and it only bends many times.
And when the hand's plantar fracture or bend occurs, it must be that his great pain crosses, and he sits straight in front of him also; then he raises his hand over an extended towel, extending the broken bones, making them equal in size until they are well joined; and apply bandages and splints if there is no movement, then a frame according to the amount of the dislocation; and it is wrapped in two layers of linen.
And if the fracture is in the palm's inner part of the plantar pad, make a strap from cloth and instruct the patient to tighten it at his plantar fracture; then bind the arm with a long bandage as strong as the hand's palm frame, and attach the frame so firmly that it is suitable for such an injury, and bind it, as it should be.
And if the fracture is in the dorsal part, it must be that you place a frame underneath and another on the plantar side so that his hands are overextended and straight, then bind the two sides entirely around the hand.
And if the fracture is at no of ours places, it must be that you make it equal in size; and bind with the plantar side, and if you see a small straight frame to lift the displacement, so as not to move; and if the displacement is elsewhere in the index or one of the others, make it equal in size, and tie them all together, which moves well, or place on an upright frame like for a pocket, or put under a straight frame, and take care with restorative measures and positioning after immobilization, as I have said.
of the dislocated kneecap
The kneecap's bones are often fractured, and he can see how they appear when she turns forward and backward; the restoration should be that you tie one bandage above the dislocation, and another below it. And his great pain is felt on his face, then extend each bandage to the corresponding side of the bone; and it's when the dislocation occurs inside the bone.
And if the dislocation is near the kneecap's root, one of the bandages should be towards his shoulder and the others around the fracture; also if it is near the genitals, then some bandages are below the genitals, or extend forward from them; put the bone in its right position between both hands according to its natural shape, and place the splint, and tie the bandage, so that there is no movement.
During dislocation of the knee enge, seiece desiseur d'l’ouroi d'rreinke ustil demeurer duer onsesuere: leslie lege apear, sience a cestile meaureiage of theere eiustraire. It requires that you wrap around the breakage .i. band hard doubled in .ij. or .iij., and beyond superfluous length, then turn the leg so the heel reaches to the root of the swelling, and stretch a long thread between the knee and thigh, beside the groin hole, and have the tip of the thread above; then turn back on the leg and thigh, and place the bandage over it, and cover an arch over the bone of the leg; then apply eight layers of soft cloth between the leg and knee to securely hold the tightening, and begin with forming .iij. or iiij. turns around the breakage; and as you go further beyond the breakage, and less the tightening, then reach into the .iij. places that are above it, and return below at the head of the thread, while the tightening does not move from its place, then let it remain in this way, until he does not come to pulling or inflammation nor any other sign.
And if it happens that the dislocation occurs and addresses whatever comes to him, as we have said many times before; and if he has pieces of bone sticking out, you must remove them carefully, if he can allow for it; but if not, then it requires cutting into the skin, and drawing out the fragments; and treat him as we have indicated, until he is completely healthy.
And never is the kneecap bent like this when placing the bandages, as in a shoulder brace or arm; all of this done in the restoration does not affect at all the patient's painful maladies.
And you know that the kneecap is restored in one year or less or more, depending on the variations of the patients' constitutions.
from the groin joint
You know that in the groin joint there is little dislocation, but it bends many times. And if it breaks, it's just one fracture or puncture, and happens with all wounds, and gives a good feeling when touched.
And the restoration consists of putting in place everything that is right for his two sides until it can hold together; then put on the splint and wrap an arch-shaped bandage, if you know how to do so, and let the tightening remain as required; then reassess all the other dislocations we have mentioned, whether there is a pulling or any other sign. If he puts anything for each particular incident that it requires him to be healthy.
from the dislocation of the leg
Seeking in the leg to find two bones, one called by right "badger", and the other called "firecracker"; and whenever there is any breakage as it happens in the arm, so the restoration will be like that of a broken arm, and the procedures are all similar.
And if the two bones are broken together, turn the leg in all directions.
And if the subtle bone is broken, turn beforehand.
And if the large bone is broken, it causes great pain and he can see well; turn on both sides then instruct in extending, and make it even, but overall, there must be a dislocation that is ugly, and it has more pieces than the extension being smaller and lighter; and adjust according to its nature.
And when you have completed your treatment, take two sturdy wooden straps that cover one side of the leg and another side up to the knee joints; then wrap around each leg under and over a bandage, and tie it in place as well, so that the leg will not tilt either to the right or left, and thus is well done; and no one applies a bandage too long on any part of the leg, and if he has blood flowing from it, they secure the leg to prevent movement, properly making this arrangement where there is an injury; and move the leg every day to see if there are no other accidents or fractures.
regarding the break in the bone at the fracture point
At the ankle there is no fracture occurrence, but at those points where bones meet, a break has never occurred and only in some cases, and it happens that pressure is placed on them to other arrangements.
And if the bones at those points are broken and you see these bones protruding from one another, put them back on the ground, as if they were falling down; then place your bone over his/her foot, lift up the leg so that it is raised, press it until the pieces come together in their joints; then apply a splint and binders undernee the broken area with a small board placed at two even intervals along the length of the foot, and tighten it to support the bone properly. Then wrap the foot in cloth, and do other things as you see fit.
And when 2 or 3 years have passed, you will see the bones become regular, because you will find that they are broken and dislocated.

Of the dislocation of the shoulder bone
When the natural shape of a woman's shoulder is dislocated, if it be swollen and inclined to the back part, then hold her by the rear; then fill her body with lint so thick as one straw; then let her stand up slightly and slowly, until the lint comes to the entrance of nature, and returns to the spine with its weight; and when she wishes to urinate, if you grasp the lint, and when she has voided, put it back, and in this way for a year or two: thus will be restored the dislocation, provided that upon seeing the bruise one applies an abdominal pouch (cystocele), and places a cannula into the cavity, and then expels all the lint therein until it is completely emptied; after which let her leave some time for this to heal.
And when the shoulder bone of an individual or woman is dislocated, as we have previously mentioned in the case of the scapula; and these proximal dislocations are not hidden from those who apply their study and use this book, because the dislocation signifies various other conditions that lead to multiple paths for restoration: therefore.
In the vein, when it is dislocated, take an olive branch and place in the vein; then wrap a cloth around it until for about three to four months or more; and it will be healed quickly.
Of dislocation accompanied by wound
It is required for those who have a dislocation with wound; especially if it is great like the scapula or shoulder joint or something similar, that they be healed now immediately; and so do the signs we mentioned testify to this.
And if the wound is healed, then restore the dislocation in that same hour or that day itself; and when the apophyseal joint does not come back, so you start over again to restore the dislocation at that time or that moment.
And if the apophyseal joints come back again, let restoration be made for a new year or so that they are calmed down and not touched in one day nor four days; because you will make it may happen bad event.

And if the extension does not aid in making it level for your hands, then use this instrument of iron that has .viij. or .vij. length, and its width according to the size of the wound; and thus is the custom to measure .iii. or iiij., depending on what each particular treatment requires for a fracture; and it should be firm and slightly large so that it does not compress too much on your workpiece, but rather ahead and bulging in front as well:
And it is called "palainge", for that the shoulder joints are placed on top of the apparent bone; and once you have inserted it, as much as it retracts, and they should be equal to each other. If the fracture is subtle, and the instruments cannot properly grasp the bone, then it is required that you set the head of the bone until the extractors have the ability.
And if you cannot retrieve the bone, as we have said, then use an instrument that is suitable for this purpose, whether it be a chisel or screwdriver; in this way, you will find those parts of the bone that are hardened and fragile.
And when the bone is retrieved, and it causes great pain afterwards, you will know that it is not in its natural place. If you wait until it is back in its original position, then moisten one sheet of thick black vinegar, and properly apply it to the area; and do not put anything on the wound with oil or any other substance which could cause rot and corruption; then dress the bone as restored, leaving the wound exposed, and coverture all around according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound does not strain with the fracture. And many times have such wise physicians done this upon a patient who was dying or corroded by any other means; and use stiffer extractors and more pliable for other types of fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large and you doubt whether it may happen, according to what we have said; do not put anything on top of dressings but wrap it tightly around stiff bandages, and cover it with linen soaked in vinegar; and when you see after one year or two that the hematoma has started to decrease at the wound site, then apply that which you have applied all over the wound, and use a healing poultice similar to those used for tetracycline medications and other remedinas.
And it is required that you reduce the limb by .ij. times a day, in the morning and evening, as long as it remains joined and sound.
And it is required that the members be freed somewhat so that the shoulder moves freely again.
And if it continues for a year and he cannot rejoin the bone but instead returns with shoulder pain, you will know that there are small pieces of bone because therefore it is required that you try to heal the wound with bandage and bind all those parts broken off.

Of burns which come from salt
We come many times after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and it is dreadful to see the misformed limb; and sometimes even the limbs cannot perform their natural functions.
Be careful that we are not fresh: if you administer harsh medicines such as aloe, incense, and myrrh, and other similar substances in any quantity or combination, and preserve them with strong wine or an abundance of water or aromatic herbs; and place them on hot coals, and hold well so that it doesn't break apart; and then separate it, and start another one until the nodes are solidified; or if you bind it to a piece of firm material; for the property of this cautery is that it hardens all the flesh above the limbs; and when the node has become as hard as stone, and it needs to be removed from underneath, and address any superfluous parts visible; or take care of it with no razor until it heals completely.
When the bone fracture is restored and afterward revisited in weakened and subtle limbs with many potential causes: for one reason it was bound too tightly, not as it should have been; or because it had too many bindings, preventing normal movement of the joint; or due to excessive manipulation (arthroscopy); or from too great movements that are unnatural in its time; or due to a lack of sufficient blood supply within its body, which leads to weakness.
And the cure is that you feed and make soft the affected area, ensuring it doesn't multiply in its size; you administer baths, giving joy and ease to the patient; then place coke (coal tar) on the limb, which attracts the great inflammation, often rinsing it with water until the inflammation returns to normal form.
A member that is still tortured following health (healing). This phrase indicates that despite the recovery period, there are ongoing complications or issues with a limb which may be experiencing pain or malformation post-recovery. These could result from poorly treated injuries or unresolved pathology such as infection, incomplete healing of fractures near joints, or chronic conditions affecting the bone structure and function like osteoporosis, persistent weaknesses which may impede full range of motion or activities.

And there is never continuous or prolonged rubbing of bone against wet hands; and whether it be the case, make sure to restrict movement in each hour of the limb.
And if the twisting is old and hardened, like stone, it needs to be struck with iron, so that even the bone is covered by a subtle incision; and bandages are applied and studied in the treatment.
Here begins the section on dislocations (starting with a discussion on this type of injury)
Dislocation arises from no joint movement, for it prevents the limb's proper function and causes severe pain and injury (explaining the mechanism by which a dislocation occurs).
When there is no dislocation (implying that any sign of misalignment must be promptly addressed).
Because if delay occurs (when one does not act promptly), the swelling may worsen, and even if it is repositioned back to its original location, there's no guarantee that it will stay in place due to inflammation—a condition described here as being prone to causing sputum production (fluid from the lungs) and other pains.
In such cases (when these issues arise), it is advisable to make the patient comfortable first; then release it as long as the painful areas are soothed; next warm and anoint each limb, and move it gently in accordance with its natural healing process (outlining a conservative treatment approach).
And I ordered the treatises on dislocations to be written from the perspective of each affected joint (indicating a directive for authors to consider individual joint involvement in such texts).
This word ("mandibles") seems to be unrelated to orthopedics; however, it could imply a discussion on injuries or conditions related to the jaw (jaws), which is also part of musculoskeletal anatomy and medical practice. It would require further context from the text to provide an accurate translation within this specific domain.
Rarely dislocations of the mandibles occur; and they are managed according to two main methods: either they are slightly displaced from their natural position, and protrude towards the teeth, or they cannot hold saliva in its mouth, and envelops his tongue with speech (describing a rare clinical scenario regarding the management of jaw dislocations that involve.

And in such a way that the minister discolors the head of the patient with leprosy, and thrusts his hand's palm into the root of the jaw dislocation located inside the mouth, if the dislocation is of .ij parts; and let the other hand be removed, to bring it equal, and instruct the patient that he softens his mandibles and moves them from all parts.
And the hands are made equal, until they return to their place.
And if the pulled back is gripped, immediately their .ij mandibles are joined together, with hot water and oil, moving lightly until they are no longer considered a pullback, as we have said before.
And when they are brought back to their original position, and the mouth of the patient with leprosy closes well, if placed under a cloth made from oil roses and wax, then moved lightly over moistened lines.
and the patient with leprosy lies on his back, and his teeth are between .ij. joints, not moving to the right or left, nor making an effort to move them, but gently chewing food until the pains have subsided and the mandibles have been relieved of their discomfort.
and then wash it gently, and does not forcefully open his mouth for eating and drinking until the jawbone is completely healed and sound.
And if the .ij mandibles cannot be brought back to their original position within an hour, and are not returned to their place at all, then it leads to fevers and habitual sicknesses, and perhaps even stomach disorders and unrestrained vomiting.
And when you see this, then you know it's a loss; and many times the patient who experiences it dies within 7 years.
of forceps (Note: This last line "de la forcelle" seems to be a reference or an allusion rather than part of the translated text, so no translation is provided.)
The forceps cannot dislocate the joint located within its continuous passage and in the pit of the mandible, and it has never been displaced from its position, and he feels very well with them. (Note: This line seems to be a mix-up or an incorrect translation as "forcelle" typically refers to forceps used in medical procedures, not dislocations.)
And the restoration is that the patient with leprosy lies down and extends his arms; then presses the affected area with your palm, which returns to its original form; and he places it on the apparatus and the bandage, and tightens. (Note: This translation attempts to make sense of a complex sentence structure related to medical restoration practices.)
and the piece that is towards the costal joint cannot dislocate; if not, and if it has never been displaced, then it returns to its original position when pressed by the physician, as we have said before. Then place it on the apparatus and the bandage, tighten, and instruct the patient with leprosy to rest until he is sound. (Note: This translation attempts to piece together a complex sentence relating to costal joint issues in medical practice.)
And so, for the same reason, they are brought back to his chest. (Note: This line appears to be an attempt at translation but seems disconnected from previous medical contexts related to leprosy and restoration practices.)
of shoulder dislocation
Cuts that the shoulder is dislocated only by .iij. (two) ways: when it dislocates from the top of the arm to the shoulder blade, and the second way is from the bottom part; and perhaps sometimes dislocates above it, but this happens rarely.
And it is not dislocated behind the shoulder, and not dislocated inside the nerves; and often dislocates towards the shoulder blade, mainly for those who have little strength, because they push it hastily; for those with enough strength, it pops out at the joints and returns to them.
And perhaps sometimes occurs in some homes by impact or fracture, and the shoulder swells due to an abscess, and one should consider it dislocated because of that.
Therefore, you must test it, as long as you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And is known when it moves towards the shoulder blade, and makes a distinction between the dislocated shoulder and a healthy one, and you will find in their manifest differences. and you will find at the top of the shoulder a pit, and inside the shoulder blade touching the top of the shoulder, just as it would be with an oesophagus; and the dislocated shoulder cannot bring its hand back to its neck or make any movement.
and also, if it is dislocated at the top, it is not hidden, because you will find it obviously on touch.
and this type of dislocation does not involve bringing back only when it is new or if the patient has many painful parts.
And the way is that the doctors lift the dislocated hand high up first, then they put cotton inside the shoulder blade and pull the joint upwards at the top of the arm with force; and the doctors will also lift the hand high up again, placing it above. If this happens suddenly.
And if it does not happen as we have said today with wrists in water warmly, then you must ensure that the dislocated parts are soaked in hot water; and they should be massaged loosening and relaxing, like infusions of honey and fenugreek and melilot flowers in hot water, and it should also be massaged.
then slant the dislocated parts on their backs, and put a piece of linen evenly under the shoulder blade there without being too hard or too soft, then place the patient's heel on top of that, and massage the upper part of the shoulder carefully, and draw out the hand with the dislocated joint.
and other doctors stitch the upper part of the dislocated hand, so that it does not move downward; this shoulder returns almost entirely now, and if you see such a recovery in these terms:
and make it so that there is one greater than the dislocated parts; and you should turn towards the patient's chest, and push on top of the dislocated shoulder inside the shoulder blade of the dislocated part, and pull upward, so that the dislocated part hangs down. :rèstant li pestires desu disloque àrire malade.  1ere aime 2eme devers lespremeres ajustice of itenté l'en espresents leu'saincthe, alexand. Injour la mercele thexame:
And the reset can also be done in another way: and it is this - to make a long stick of earth, on which the shoulder joint shall also rest like a pillar, and not too large nor too small. Then put the maladie thereon but let it be covered with soot underneath, and the shoulder's pain shall stretch long like a burning fire; then extend his hand in another direction to form an angle, and the joint will return to its original position quickly.
And if it does not return by all these things that we have said, then perform this treatment: take an iron rod of two arms and four inches in width, with the top end to enter through another part around the shoulder blade according to this form.
Then put the soot-covered stick on top of the long painful part, that it does not bleed the malady, then place it around the malady; extend your arm over the long stick, and attach the splint to the stick, placing the hand at the head of the arm, then place a broad shield under one shoulder blade, stretch out the hands backwards, and let the heart pump from another part. The joint will return to its original position immediately.
And when it is done, in whatever way it may be, you must place a spider of the same wool around the shoulder blade, then apply an emplaster filled with powder, incense, and burning frankincense on the entire arm and chest, straighten out from the shoulder blade to the end of the stick, turn the bandage underneath the emplaster, wrap the hand in its collar, and leave the hands resting like this.
And it is required that he massage lightly until the limbs are supported, because they will heal faster; and then massage more after five or six years, move him again; if it is firm but not softened, then it is healthy.
And if the bandage is tight due to moisture or for other reasons, it is required that you perform three small punctures on him, as if he were placed before a physician performing cupping therapy.
And if you do all this and after twenty years the bandage does not hold, and he cannot raise his arms upwards, then you know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are compressed or stretched out or softened; and you know that the joint has never been inserted back into its original position.
The dislocation towards the shoulder and the back muscles, or posteriorly, is made by impact and extension of hands, and another type of bandage applied; and treat until it is healthy.
And after the healing comes soreness in the limb, and then gradually returns to its original position; and let the maladies' pain be relieved many times until that soreness is alleviated, and return to its first state.
of the shoulder dislocation
Cuts that detach the joint are pulled out by pricks, and they come back to their place; and if they have been completely separated from all parts, especially in front and behind, and dislocations cannot be repositioned because it is clearly visible and felt; and dislocated according to each type. And when you join the malaligned bone with the body, if it can be seen openly. Because the joint is fused, and cannot bow the arm or touch its shoulder in any way.
And it is required that you reset it immediately after pulling out the arrowheads, because if the arrowheads were removed, it would be difficult to pull them back; and perhaps they cannot be pulled back completely in all cases, especially when they are at the rear; and worse than other dislocations, there is greater pain, and sometimes the wound may come.
And the restoration is, when it can be brought back to its place, extend your hand towards yours; and stretch out his arms, and adjust the hands according to the bone's position both above and below, and fix the joint together with all his palms or at the root of his palm, until it returns to its original position.
And if the dislocation is at the front, it returns when he doubles his hand towards his other hand, and firmly fixes the root of the bone that has been detached.
And if he cannot return to the original position, apply strong extension; and both ministers extend his arm, and wrap them with a double and wide cloth, so that it does not move during the extension; then turn his arm in each direction.
And when he touches the fused joint with his hand, do not oil it at all to soften the joint, then fix the joint firmly until it returns.
And when it is at the original position, place it on a flat surface with an underlay of soft fabric, and stretch out firmly, then straighten his crooked arm, and let him rest for some time, then release it.
And if the joint is firm in its original position, release the bandage and let it rest; and if you see that the joint does not relax well, restart the underlay and the bandage, and leave it for some time until it is securely fastened; then remove it.
And if he feels tightened after the return of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub well, and press until it becomes relaxed; or you put a warm cloth on the joint for one day and a night, then let the doctor determine whether to give him a bath or not. And when he sweats, rub the joint continuously, then put the warm cloth back on it, and alternately bathe or not as determined by the doctor; and do this for one, two, three times until it becomes healthy again; and if you see fit, place a damp woolen cloth with lamb's fat underneath and stretch out. If it returns to its original position.
the dislocation of the hand.
The dislocation of the hand, and its return is light, always compared to other joints; it must be brought back quickly, immediately after it has been dislocated, so that the fingers are swollen or that they twist at the wrist.
And the repositioning is that you place the malaligned hand on a table, extend your ministers' hands, and make them equal in height, so he places his palm over the appearance of the dislocation, and pushes it back until it returns to its original position.
Always, it is necessary that you look to see if it is well placed; then put the malaligned back of your hand on the table with extension and retraction. And if the dislocation is in the back of the hand, he must put his malaligned back on the table, and look at putting his hand over the appearance of the dislocation; if it returns now, that's good.
If not, if the strain of the manipulations in the wrist relaxes the abscess, then let it continue in that direction to attempt a repeat repositioning.
And if it cannot be tolerated, and you cannot put it back in place after any day, then the dislocation remains twisted.
and deny the patient that their hands are softened or weak, and unable to exert any movement: therefore you know that there is damage to the nerves or arteries; if there is no other method for this than with cauterization near the case, and perhaps it's not worth trying anything else.
And when the hand is back in place, if you put it on the elevator that we have mentioned, then pull and release over several days, then let it go again in this position.
And if it cannot move well and has no cracks or breaks, then apply warm water therapy and friction until healed.

And so it is for these two cases, and reset the dislocation in your pockets as much as he returns, then support the head of the two pieces thereof, and push towards the place where they are joined.
And let it rest for two years, and then place the graft on that year; and bind it tightly as we have said, and allow the joint to heal, and make the limb move again, and reattach the graft as long as it remains narrow.
And also do this, if it is dislocated in the abdomen of the hand, and do so as you have done before, until he becomes sound; and likewise do this when it is dislocated from another place.
double dislocation of the scapula (shoulder blade)
When the scapula (shoulder blade) or neck is dislocated, or there are several dislocations, if there is no remedy, because the malady hastens quickly.
And the signs are that the elevations move freely by themselves, and it cannot hold them; and many times they become weak in any limb, or both shoulders or two arms.
And many times the scapula moves to four parts; that which moves towards the back is called "gilbert's disease."
The remedy for this condition, if it is due to childhood, there is no cure or treatment in total.
And that which falls from a fall or due to other things, the old methods of treatments are proclaimed in large words by ancient healers, but it does not bring much benefit.
However, I have attempted it according to my intention, and have formed different remedies in various ways.
I assert that the backward Gilbert's disease, which occurs in front of the pelvis, has no treatment or cure.
Also the one that directly affects the inner sides and cannot be cured by anything except for the condition itself, as I have stated before;
And it is that the maladies are extended below his chin in one piece, and there is strain on top of him from which he cannot be torn apart;
Then place a piece of fire at the top of the body formed in earth, and another for the legs, and tie one band underneits (lower jaw), and another for the back joints, and for shoulders, and knees, and ankles.
And two ministers know them, one on the top of the body and others to the legs, among these injuries.

sse (it. And put the physician's fingers on the other top of the table, and press well until it returns to its place; and if you see him doing it, let him turn in his hand.
And you place three marks on the shoulder of the patient with a large arm, and between each mark, there is half an inch of space;
And in each mark there is an incision, and it must be firmly pressed into the ground so that they do not move; and between each of these marks there should be a second mark where the turning pin turns, as long as those pins turn with movement, and in these turning marks there should be small marks about half an inch apart, to allow for turning the pin.
And then the pin that is among the slits on the turning device towards the shoulder's top; and the other pin toward the fingers to the other turning device, and each minister turns his turning pin along the entire line, and the master places an equal iron splinter as we have said before.
And if it is hot enough, and then apply a drying agent with abundant heat, and then the torches, and then an oven made of two feet long table, which will mark its area from spondylitis and the healthy part of the vertebrae, and tie it together along that line as we have said before, and use his maladies softly so that he remains sound.
And if none of these methods achieve the desired healing, it is necessary to administer softer and milder medicines with that oven we mentioned earlier; and sometimes I apply a piece of cloth in this manner.
And sometimes there is an appearance in the back of the upper spine, and it must be taken care of as dislocations; for the bone that opens up, so we should not have any presumption: perhaps by chance it would come to death.
dislocations of the hip:
Its dislocations occur only at the joints of the neck and shoulders, not from fractures as other joints do; and the joint of the neck is displaced according to four parts: in front and behind, and further in front and behind.
And the knowledge of dislocations in that area is such that when joining a sick leg with a healthy one, it becomes longer and more open at the malformed feet than in the healthy, and the patient cannot double his heel size by fire. And the leg that is below the knee joint protrudes because the shoulder blades come out.
And the sign of those who suffer this injury appears behind; however, these accidents are contrary to them.
And the signs of those who suffer this injury in front are that their leg is well-proportioned according to completion; however, it does not double the heel size with pain, and if they try to walk, they cannot do so without difficulty, retaining urine, swelling the ankle, and when they move, it passes over the heel.
And the signs of those who suffer this injury behind are that they cannot expand their heel, double it, and that leg is more cramped than the other; pain in the shoulder blades subsides, and the shoulders protrude at the side of the ribs.
The treatment of this kind of dislocation is that you must recognize the dislocation as ancient, and it lasts according to its position, without any remedy; there is no need for presumption.
And in the case of this recent dislocation, it is one of three kinds of displacement, and if you hasten to return the joint, it will be placed in front and back, and the malformation will occur on both sides; perhaps it will return, and there is no need for other treatment.
And if it does not return in this way, it is required that you provide one strong minister and hold the leg firmly with two hands or under a chain placed above the heel. And other ministers extend their hand in a way that they push the patient's hands away from his chest, and strangle him with a short rope above the shoulder blade; others hold the head of the noose.
And they extend up and down repeatedly, so that the patient with maladies is raised from the ground once, and then left hanging.
This method of extension is common in three cases and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is good. However, this statement does not endorse these practices but merely notes their historical prevalence.
If that is not the case, it requires treatment for its appearance. When the dislocation is anteriorly displaced, it must be supported on his ribcage, then a rope should be placed under the shoulder blade roots and over the angle of honor, then two ropes should go up to the root of the honor and above it, and at its front and back. This method seems ineffective and cruel by today's standards.
And this type of displacement is presens toteiles en avant, etre dame paroles a laine de malades, eter les malaide esmeentier de l’aide apreis semblant choses, sience espace quels estime.

Then it is hung from the top of a beam, and then he orders his ministers to encircle the head of the shoulder, and other ministers are hanging with the patient, who embraces the neck area, because now the connection returns quickly.
And when the dislocation is considered dangerous, if it causes the patient great pain as we mentioned in those with gigantism, and straightens one limb affected by the dislocation specifically, and also the other leg;
Then he applies two sticks, one to the head and another to the affected leg of the patient, then inserts a stick between the neck area and maintains its shape around the dislocation; And it is covered with wet cloths to prevent the patient's pain from worsening, then extends each minister towards him, and they place the dislocation in his hand;
If it returns on its own, that's good. But if not, put it under a table and press it as we have mentioned in the case of gigantism, and cause pain to the patient along his healthy side;
And when the dislocation is in front of it, it must hasten to extend the affected leg, and according to what I have said; place the pain on the patient's side facing the malformed area, then press with another hand, and pull it away from his knee;
And if the dislocation is considered dangerous, it does not need to extend or elevate the affected limb above ground, but rather should be kept in a position as if it had been previously dislocated and then slowly returned to its original state, similar to what we have described for lying on two shoulders; And it should be placed on the chest, and the limb is extended as we have described before, and must push against the joint at the table;
And there will be a point when the patient's legs extend and they are equal; then adjust the shoulders, and apply an emplastron (compression dressing), and tighten it with a bandage so that the dislocation does not move again;
And if it rests for three years or four, then release the pressure and apply the emplastron; and if you see that they are equal, and let it loose, and let him walk again as long as his members are comfortably secured.
of the dislocated shoulder
The joints are dislocated in three ways: inside and out, and behind; they do not dislocate forward.
And the signs are that you instruct the patient to bend his leg at the hip, and if it does not reach the hip joint, then you know he is dislocated.
And the repositioning of all dislocations is when you make the patient lie on their right side, extend their leg if possible, place your back against their knee, and then have them lean forward with their hands resting on their feet.
Then take the patient's joint with your palms, and draw between his legs; then flex both sides of the dislocated joint; and other assistants extend their legs until the hip joint returns to its place, indicating that the knee is moving correctly towards the hip.
And apply the bandage, and draw the leg back to the hip, then tightly assemble it for two or three years; finally release him; and do not work on alleviating his pain until his limb is completely stable.
And if the member does not improve, apply strong stretching as we have mentioned in the treatment of hernia, until it becomes sound again.
from the double dislocation of the ankle joint
The ankles are never dislocated entirely and inside out; rather, they are partially displaced both ways.
And one of the signs is when the ankle joint has gone too far in its dislocation; before attempting any intervention at that point, it should be evaluated.
The repositioning process is gradual and must be extended gradually in the patient's hands when he is dislocated only slightly.
And when it is completely dislocated, it must be ensured that you make the patient lie on their right side and use two assistants to hold the leg above the knee joint.
Then bring the patient's leg to your right hand, and then raise it twice with that same hand, place it back down gently, and push upwards on the hip joint firmly.
and do it twice as we have mentioned, pushing and pulling the hip joint; if it returns well; if it does not return, re-treatment.

Then slap the patient's shoulder, and stretch other officials to extend his hand or two fingers over the neck of the animal; where they hold it up on the collar. Then stretch each official equally, and let their hands be placed between the patient's shoulders to hold the sick person back when they are held.
Then place the stones at equal intervals in the patient's hand, and other officials slap the healthy leg down on the ground, and the dislocation will quickly return.
And when it reaches the point, if they apply the plaster and stick it on, and form the straps, and hold the patient's leg, and warn those who are above the ankle behind to not be too tight.
Then let it be for two or three years, and if the straps loosen, then release them; otherwise, move the patient every year or quarter to aid in their recovery over three years. And if it advances before this end, it is not certain that he will no longer dislocate.
And if an abscess comes up, you must treat it as we have said in other places, until it is healthy again.
two or three years.
When the dislocations are loosened, they must be extended with work, and it is a light thing.
And if the dislocations are in no part of either shoulder blade, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on one plain surface or on an inclined table straight, and put your hand under what has formed from these joints, then press firmly with your hands until he returns.
And when it is equalized, and nothing appears, place the foot of the patient on a table with two legs, make the straps firm, then leave for two years, release them, and let him rest until he is healthy again.
from wounds and dislocations together.
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and it is desired to restore it, there are many times when the patient dies:.
if you are not presumptuous in the treatment, provided that you understand the art and have used it for a long time, and if you are compassionate and merciful, and do not act hastily.
and start with gentle restraints for the patient's chest, leaving them in God' Administered this if you see no hope of recovery. but when you see hope, now tighten the member to the limb, so that it does not move; this will help.
and when the limb is straightened, administer gentle things to restrain the dislocations, and treat the wound, if it's supposed.
