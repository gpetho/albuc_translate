On the care of panaritium, injured nail, and incision of an extra finger, and section.
Chapter 91.
Panaritium is an abscess that forms under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and perhaps it occurs on other fingers.
When its condition is prolonged, and treatment is neglected, it becomes a warm abscess or decays and releases pus, until it corrodes the nail root; it may destroy it entirely, and sometimes the decay reaches the bone, producing a foul odor, and the tip of the finger becomes swollen and dark-colored.
When you are treating it as we described in the previous section, and your treatment is not effective, then you must cut away with an iron all the excess that remains of the nail.
Then cauterize the wound afterward.
For cauterization is very helpful.
If, however, the bone is sound and the nail is also healthy, and the empty extensions of the nail press the flesh inward, begin to prick it, and injure it, then you should place a thin stick under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh and push it upward; cut away the flesh with ease, and apply burning or corrosive medicines to what remains of the flesh until all of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
But if the decay has already affected the bone, then you must cut away that bone and remove it, for it will never heal as long as the corrupted bone remains.
If you see the corrosion and decay spreading into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, as previously described.
Then treat it until it heals.
If the nail is damaged or struck, causing intense pain, then first it is necessary to perform phlebotomy on the patient.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula in a transverse incision from above toward the visible part.
Be careful not to let the incision reach the flesh under the nail, for you would cause intense pain for the patient and lead to the growth of extra flesh in that spot.
Then treat the area with something that soothes pain.
An extra finger, which appears in some people's hands, may be entirely fleshy, or in some cases contain bones, or may even have a nail; and some grow from the root of a joint or originate at certain joints of the finger.
One that grows at certain finger joints is immobile, while one that grows near a finger joint may be mobile.
Thus, the section of those that are fleshy is easy.
That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
However, the treatment of one that originates at the root of a joint is difficult.
Therefore, refrain from incising it.
But for one that grows on the finger near the last joint, you should first cut its flesh in a circular incision down to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suited for it.
Then treat it until it heals.
Fusion of the fingers, which often occurs either by birth — that is, they are born with it — or by the healing of a wound, or by burning with fire, and similar causes.
It is necessary, therefore, to cut that fusion until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Then place linen strips or cloths soaked in rose oil between them, so they do not fuse again quickly, and keep them separated; or place a thin lead sheet between them until the area consolidates as needed.
Similarly, if some fingers are fused with the palm, then cut that fusion according to what is prepared and suited to the shape of the limb.
