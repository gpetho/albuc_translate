Chapter 97.
Leeches are not applied to many parts except to parts where it is not possible to place cups, due to the small size of those parts, such as the feet and gums and similar to them; or on parts devoid of flesh, such as the finger and the nose and similar to them.
And the quality of using those is that you have found leeches in clean freshwater ponds.
And then they should be left for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry, and no substance remains in their stomachs; and then the body should be evacuated at the beginning with bloodletting and cupping; and then rub the patient's part until it reddens; and then place them on it.
And when they are filled and fall off.
And if it is possible to suction the place with a cup, it is more beneficial afterwards.
And if not, then wash the place with vinegar and then with plenty of water; and it should be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the blood continues to flow after the leeches fall off, and this happens, then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it over it until the bleeding stops.
And if the blood is abundant, then sprinkle over it crushed vitriol, or galls and similar astringents, until the blood stops; or place on the site halves of cooked beans, and leave them until the beans adhere to the site, and the blood stops.
And if necessary, repeat the application of leeches, as often as you can replace them.
And if leeches are prohibited from being suspended, then rub the site with fresh blood or insert a needle into the sites until blood comes out; and then place them, because when they sense any blood, they will attach immediately.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little crushed aloe, or salt, or ash on them, and they will fall off immediately.
