Chapter 57.
On the cleaning of children and the treatment of what happens to them after circumcision.
Circumcision is not a break in continuity like other wounds: but since it is our procedure and our intention, and its use is mainly in children, it is necessary to assign the best operation and the easiest way to lead to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not describe circumcision in any of their books, because it was not used in their laws, and it is only because we have learned through experience, which is why I have found that most craftsmen and barbers use circumcision and cleaning with a razor and tweezers; and they use ligation with bile and incision with the nail.
And I have tried all these methods and found no better cleaning with scissors, ligation with bile than with nail cleaning, because often the upper layer escapes, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is very quickly forced into another incision and sure pain.
And with the cleaning done by wrapping, and it is digital, which cobblers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not ensured, because it very quickly goes into the hole.
But with the operation with the nail, you very quickly encounter iron and corrupt your operation.
And the childâ€™s foreskin is naturally short, and often it is born in such a way that it does not need cleaning, and I have seen this.
But from the cleaning done with scissors and ligation with bile, the quality, experience revealed to me, because the scissors are of proportional incision, because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below; and when you press with your hand, two sharp edges are proportionate, and you incise accordingly in one go; and the compression of the bile is made in a shape containing the foreskin of the penis in all parts, with which no error happens at all.
And the way of the first operation is that you make the child stand, especially if it is one who understands a little, so you only tie the bile on his penis and leave it until the next day.
Then make him happy in any way that is possible for you and that he understands.
Then make him stand between your hands properly, and not be restless; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so the child does not see them or any other instruments.
Then put your hand on his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it until the tip of the penis comes out, and then clean it from any dirt that has accumulated on it.
Then tie the marked spot with double bile, and tie a second ligature slightly lower, and then hold the spot of the lower ligature with your thumb with good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then lift the foreskin slightly and extract the tip of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, because it is better; and sprinkle powder on it and place a cloth on the powder which is spread with moss from a boiled egg mixed with fresh rose oil; and leave it until the next day; and treat it with a cure until it is healed.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning, this is the shape:
One end should be non-cutting and the other should be cutting, so that the ram does not come out of the nail, and the length of the two sharp edges should be equal to the length of the two handles.
But the error in cleaning is that the entire inner foreskin, or part of it, often escapes towards the incision.
So you need to stretch it from your time with your nail before the swelling of the area and incise it accordingly.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and the area under the penis remains swollen and festering, then leave it until the swelling subsides, and then peel it easily and incise it as you see fit.
And be careful of the tip of the penis, as this will not harm it.
And then treat it with what consolidates the wound from the powders we have mentioned in the treatise on powders.
And if the foreskin is incised beyond measure, and it reaches the upper parts, this does not harm it.
And then treat it with what we have mentioned until it is healed.
