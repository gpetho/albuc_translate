On the method of cauterizing a corroding sore or ulcer.
Chapter 54.
A corroding sore is essentially decay spreading through the flesh, eating it away like fire devours dry wood.
If you see a corroding sore in an area that can tolerate fire cautery, then apply several cauteries, both small and large, depending on the area affected by the sore.
Then cauterize it thoroughly from all sides until all the decayed tissue is eradicated, leaving no trace of it whatsoever.
Leave the area for three days, and apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil over the cauterized spots, until all the scabs and decay are removed.
Afterward, treat the area with ointments that promote new flesh growth.
If, after three days, you see healthy new flesh growing without any decay, it is a good sign.
If not, then repeat the cauterization on any remaining decayed areas.
Sometimes, corroding sores are treated with strong medicines instead of cauterization.
Such a treatment acts in place of cautery.
However, fire cautery provides faster relief; I have already described the use of strong medicines in another section. Refer to it when you need that information.
