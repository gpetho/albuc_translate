Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of a fractured sternum.
The sternum may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens. As for its edges, they are most often fractured and fragmented. Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, it inclines downwards, and severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing occur.
And perhaps he coughs up blood, and the depression in the fractured bone becomes apparent and is not hidden from feeling. Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, with a pillow placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are pressed, and the ribs are brought together by hands from both sides, gently straightening it in every possible way.
And continue until the shape of the bone returns as it should be, then apply the bandage and the dressing, and place over it a splint from a thin board of willow or heather or similar in lightness, after wrapping it in a cloth.
Then gently tie it over the fractured bone so that it does not move, and pass the bandage around to the back several times and tighten it firmly, then check the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if it becomes necessary to untie it due to itching, pain, or swelling that occurs in the area, then quickly untie it and remove the dressing and treat what has occurred with its appropriate treatment, then replace the dressing if you see fit.
and stick to tightening it until it heals.
