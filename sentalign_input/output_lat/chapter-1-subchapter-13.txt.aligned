On cauterization of persistent lachrymation.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of chronic tearing.	0.6442108
When tears are constantly in the eye and arise on account of the arteries and veins visible on the outside of the head, and you are sure that they are from cold thick phlegmatic superfluities, burn him with the very cautery that I taught for the beginning of cataract, namely, a cauterization in the middle of the head and two on the temples, and two on the back of the neck below the two bones; and, if you are compelled to add more, one cauterization on the side of the outer corner of each eye at the end of the eyebrow, with a small cautery.	When tears of the eyes are chronic, continuous, and located over the veins and arteries on the external surface of the head, it is confirmed that this is due to cold, phlegmatic excesses. Then cauterize with the same cautery I described at the beginning for descending fluid, with a cautery at the middle of the head, two cauteries over both temples, and two cauteries at the neck under the two bones. And if you need to add more, then cauterize it on each side near the eye, on the tip of the eyebrow with a small cautery.	0.9001769
