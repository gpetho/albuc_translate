The author of this book, having completed for you, my children, this book, which is a complete part of the science of medicine, and having reached the peak of clarity and explanation in it, has seen fit to complete it for you with this chapter, which is a part of practical application.
Because practical application, in our country and in our time, is utterly lacking, almost to the point of the study of its knowledge being abandoned and its effects disappearing. And only a few traces remain in the books of the ancients, which have been corrupted by hands and tainted by error and confusion, until their meanings have become obscure and their benefit has receded.
Therefore, I have seen fit to revive it and compose this chapter on the path of explanation, clarity, and brevity, and to include depictions of cauterizing irons and other instruments of practice, since this is an addition to clarity and an aid to what is needed.
The reason there are no skilled practitioners with their hands in our time is that the craft of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first diligently study the anatomy as described by Galen. Until he grasps the benefits of the organs, their structures, humors, connections, and separations, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number and exits, and the pulsating and still veins and their exit points.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the practical craft.  We have touched upon this point in the introduction to this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable about the anatomy we have mentioned will inevitably make a mistake that will kill people, as I have witnessed often in those who have imagined themselves experts in this field without knowledge or understanding.
For I have seen an ignorant physician, who incised a scrofulous tumor on a woman's neck, and severed some of the neck's arteries, causing the woman to bleed to death in his hands.
And I saw another physician, while removing a stone from an elderly man, the stone being large, acted rashly and removed it with a piece of the bladder's tissue. So the man died about three days later.  I was called to remove it, and upon seeing the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I judged it impossible.
And I saw another physician who earned his living by practicing medicine for some of the leading citizens of our town.
A dark-skinned boy had a fracture in his leg near the heel, accompanied by a wound.  The physician, in his ignorance, quickly tightened the fracture with bandages and splints very tightly, leaving no breathing room for the wound.
Then he indulged his desires, and left the boy for days, ordering him not to loosen the bandage until his leg and foot were swollen and he was close to death.
I was called to him, and quickly loosened the bandage.  He gained relief and his pain subsided, but the damage had already taken hold in the limb, and I was unable to stop it.
The damage continued to affect the limb until he died.
I saw another physician treat a cancerous tumor.  After days, it ulcerated, and the patient's condition worsened. This is because if the cancer is purely of a dark, black humor, it should not be treated with iron at all.
Unless it is in a limb that can be completely removed.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual treatment is divided into two categories: treatment accompanied by safety, and treatment often resulting in harm.
I have warned in every place in this book of work that involves risk and fear, and you should avoid and reject it.
So that the ignorant may not find a way to speak ill of you, be firm and cautious, and gentle and resolute in treating your patients.
Employ the best path leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure illnesses.
Keep yourselves free from that which you fear might bring doubt upon your religion and worldly affairs; it is more enduring for your reputation and raises your status in this world and the hereafter.
Galen said in some of his precepts: Do not treat a bad illness, and you will be known as a bad physician.
This article is divided into three chapters.
The first chapter.
In cauterization by fire and cauterization with a sharp medicine, arranged from the heel to the foot, the illustrations of instruments, cauterizing devices, and everything necessary for manual work.
And the second chapter.
In incision, lancing, venesection, cupping, surgeries, removal of arrows, and similar procedures, all arranged and illustrated with diagrams of the instruments.
And the third chapter.
In setting fractures, dislocations, and treatment of sprains, and similar procedures, arranged from the heel to the foot, and with illustrations of the instruments.
The first chapter.
In cauterization.
Before describing the procedure, it is necessary to discuss its benefits and drawbacks, and in which temperament it should be used.
I say that discussing the benefits and harms of cauterization is a lengthy and meticulous subject, a hidden secret, and many wise men have spoken upon it.
Their opinions differed, and I have summarized the essentials of their words for fear of being lengthy.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for every bad temperament, with or without matter, except for two temperaments: a hot temperament without matter and a dry temperament without matter.
Concerning a dry temperament with matter, they differed. Some said that cauterization is beneficial, while others said the opposite, that cauterization is unsuitable for an illness arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured of a hot, dry disease by a hot, dry remedy.  The one who says the opposite claims that cauterization with fire may be beneficial for a hot, dry disease that occurs in people's bodies. Because when you add the body of a person and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the person's body cold.
And I say as he says, because experience has revealed this to me many times, but this should only be considered by someone who has practiced and trained extensively in the art of cauterization. And he must understand the diverse temperaments of people, the nature of illnesses themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially cold, moist diseases. All physicians agree on this, and they do not disagree about the benefit of cauterization in these cases.
Know, my children, that the secret of cauterization with fire, and its superiority over cauterization with a burning drug, is that fire is a simple element whose effect is limited to the organ cauterized, and it does not harm a connected organ except to a slight extent.
Cauterization with a burning drug may extend its effect to other organs, and may even cause a difficult-to-treat disease in the affected organ or even death.  Fire, due to its noble and pure nature, does not do this unless it is excessive.
This has been made clear to us through experience, due to long service, careful attention to the craft, and observing the true nature of the matter.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse.  Were it not inappropriate for this book, I would have presented you with a profound secret about fire, its action on bodies, and its ability to dispel diseases using a rigorous philosophical and demonstrative argument that would be too subtle for your understanding.
Know, my children, that they have differed regarding the appropriate time for cauterization, and they consider spring the best time.
I say that cauterization may be appropriate at any time, for any harm caused by the time will be overcome by the benefit derived from cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for a strong, necessary and urgent ailment that cannot tolerate delay, for fear of a greater calamity following from it than the minor harm that arises from the time.
Do not, my children, consider the notion of the common people and ignorant physicians that a cauterization that cures a disease will never return and that you should regard it as a curse.
And the matter is not as you suppose, for cauterization is like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries the moisture that is the cause of the ailments.
However, cauterization is preferred to medicine for the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
The illness may return sometime in the future, according to the patient's temperament, the strength and severity of the disease, and the accumulation of humors in the body, and their negligence in acquiring suitable nourishment, and similar causes.
Unless the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild disease in a part of the body with few humors and moisture. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain, and similar cases, the pain may not return, and this will be the minimum.
Also, the common saying that cauterization is the last resort in medicine is correct, but not for the reason they believe, since they think that no treatment will be of benefit after cauterization, which is not the case.
The meaning of cauterization being the last resort in medicine is that, if various treatments are used for a disease and those remedies are ineffective, then cauterization, as the final measure, proves successful.  This is why cauterization is considered the last resort. Not in the sense that the common people and many ignorant physicians understand it.
The ancients stated that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron.  They said this because of gold's moderation and the nobility of its essence, and that it does not cause the cauterized area to fester.  However, this is not universally true.
For I have tested it and found that it only produces this result in some bodies, not in others.  Cauterization with gold is indeed better and superior to that with iron, as they said. However, if you heat a gold cautery in the fire, you cannot easily determine when it has reached the desired temperature for the gold's redness.
Because cold quickly affects it, and if you increase the heat, it melts in the fire and is distorted.  This results in the worker having difficulty with it. Therefore, cauterization by iron is, in our view, quicker, closer to correctness, and more suitable for practice, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization in sections, organized from the head to the foot, so that the student may easily find what he desires, God willing.
Chapter One.
Cauterization of the head: single cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for excess moisture and cold in the brain, which are the cause of headaches, frequent colds from the head down to the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and sore throat. And generally, for any illness arising from cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, stupor, and similar ailments.
The procedure for this cauterization is that the patient should first be induced to vomit using a purgative medicine appropriate for the head, for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and habits.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, then have him sit before you, squatting with his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes.  Wherever your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-oil cautery, which has this form.
If the bone is exposed to the extent of a bodkin's head or the size of a carbuncle, lift your hand; otherwise, reheat the same iron, or another, if it has cooled. Until you see the bone as I described to you, then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a piece of cotton in it.  Place it on the affected area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a piece of cotton soaked in clarified butter and leave it until the burning sensation subsides.  Then treat it with the four-part ointment until it heals, God willing.
They said that the longer a wound remains open, the more it discharges pus, and this is better and more beneficial.
Some have said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some of the bone's thickness is burned.  Then, what has been burned of the bone should be scraped away and subsequently treated.
Others said that the cauterization should be excessive, so as to affect the bone strongly, so that it falls away like a small piece of pottery or a small flake.  They claimed that this releases vapors from the head through that area and that the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals.  I do not see these two types of cauterization at all, except in certain individuals, and by way of chance.  I believe leaving it alone is better.  With respect, the head weakens once its natural connections are broken, as we have observed in other organs.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak.  The first type of cauterization is safer and better, in my opinion.  Use it, and you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
On cauterizing the head also.
If a chronic pain arises in the entirety of the head, and this affliction prolongs, and if the patient has tried applications, ointments, flogging, and dressings, and especially if the single cauterization described previously was performed, and none of these treatments worked, then consider... If the patient's head is strong constitutionally and not weak, and if they experience severe cold, cauterize again, slightly above the previous cauterization. Then cauterize a cauterization on each horn of his head until the thickness of the skin disappears, and the bone is exposed to the extent we described. And cauterize a cauterization at the back of his head, in the area known as the "axe" [or "the place of the axe"].  Be gentle in this one, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience intense pain unlike the pain of any other head cauterizations.  I will discuss this cauterization in its proper place.
The cautery used for the horns and back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used for the middle of the head.  This is its form.
Chapter Three.
In the cauterization of the non-chronic fistula.
If, in a fissure of the head, pain occurs with a headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then the patient should be purged with medications that cleanse the head.  Use all other treatments that I have mentioned in the divisions of diseases. If this does not work, cauterization in this case has two approaches. Either by cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine or by iron.
As for cauterization with the burning medicine, one takes one clove of garlic, peels it, and cuts its ends on both sides. Then, slice the site of the pain from the temple with a wide scalpel until a space under the skin forms that can accommodate the clove.
Place it under the skin until it disappears, then compress it firmly with a bandage for about fifteen hours, then remove it and take out the garlic.  Leave the wound for two or three days, then bandage it.
Place a cotton swab dipped in ghee on it until the area becomes suppurated, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. Or, if you wish, you may do this with some of the burning medicines that I have provided in the eighteenth article on burning medicines.
As for cauterizing with iron, it is done this way: heat the cauterizing iron, which is depicted as follows:
The cauterizing iron is called the nail-shaped iron because its head is shaped like a nail, with some indentations and a small protuberance in the middle.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while turning the iron a little bit at a time, the amount of skin burned should be about half its thickness. Then lift your hand so as not to burn the vein beneath, causing bleeding, then soak a cotton swab in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days. Then apply the cotton swab with oil, then treat with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this abscess with the knife-like tip of the cauterizing iron, thereby avoiding cutting the vein in this chronic abscess, especially.
Chapter Four.
Treating chronic abscesses.
If you have treated the abscess with the aforementioned treatment and what we have described in the sections on diseases, and the treatment has not been successful, and you see a cause that the first cauterization, either with medicine or fire, cannot handle. Then you should heat the knife-like cauterizing iron until it whitens, after having marked the painful area with a line about half a finger in length or so.  Release your hand once, pulling until you cut the vein and reach the bone.
However, you should be careful not to touch the jaw that moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or nerve that moves it, causing spasms.
And be cautious and careful of the bleeding from the artery you cut, for there is risk in cutting it. Especially for those who do not know what to do and have not had proven experience; leaving the work alone is better.
A description of the treatment for accidental bleeding from an artery will come later in this book, God willing, if you see a condition for which this cauterization is not sufficient.
And if you find the patient's condition tolerable, cauterize a spot in the center of the head as described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cauterization mentioned in the chapter on tying off arteries with the double-bladed cautery iron; it is a better and more effective cauterization than this.
Chapter Five.
On cauterizing ear aches.
If an earache occurs due to cold and has been treated with laxatives and other treatments mentioned in the classification, but the pain does not subside, then cauterize the ear with the cautery iron, which is shaped like a dot, as depicted here.
Then, after heating it, apply it around the entire ear, or around both of them if the pain is in both, in a circular motion. Move the cautery slightly away from the base of the ear after marking the area with ink. The cautery should be about ten dots in each ear, or approximately that amount. Then, treat the affected areas until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Six.
In cauterizing the fistula.
The fistula treated by cauterization is of the type that arises from phlegm, as mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
One should avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you have treated this type of fistula with applications, poultices, and gargles, and your treatment has been unsuccessful, then the affected area should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization should be performed with one cauterization opposite the upper part of the ear, a little below the crown of the head, and another in the temple.  Its length should be equal to the length of the thumb.
Apply the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin.  This is the image of the cautery iron, a type of knife previously shown, but slightly gentler as you see. The knife should have a slightly greater thickness, then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On cauterization of chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and you have treated it as we described, and your treatment is ineffective and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize four times. One cauterization on each temple, one in the middle of the head as previously mentioned, and one at the back of the head, as previously stated.
The cauterization method, as previously mentioned, and a cauterization may also be applied to the mouth of the stomach, which would be more effective, then treat as previously mentioned.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
The one that is from phlegm, the patient should first be given large emetics and purging grains for the brain.
Then his entire head should be shaved, and a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on dressings, should be applied to his back repeatedly, for it is a type of cauterization.
And do this in the same manner as mentioned there.  If he recovers with this, well and good; otherwise, cauterize three times at the back of his head, arranged in a row from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
Place the thickness of a finger between each cauterization.  Then treat the cauterization as previously described. If you wish to increase the treatment, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you wish to increase the treatment, cauterize at the temples, and then treat until he recovers.  The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterization for paralysis and general relaxation of the body.
One should first cleanse the head with the methods mentioned previously.  Then shave the patient's head and cauterize with one cautery in the center of the head, one on each temple, and one on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck.  If, for a case of body relaxation, more than that is needed, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is strong and entrenched, then cauterize four times on the vertebrae of his back. Cauterize deeply until most of the skin is burned, then raise your hand and treat it as previously described until it heals, God willing.  Use an olive-oil cautery.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterization for epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is from phlegm should be cauterized. First, his brain should be cleansed with large leeches, and with all the other treatments we have mentioned in the section, if the patient is large and able to take the medicines.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicine, then use gargles and mouthwashes that cleanse the brain many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then shave his head, and cauterize with one cautery in the center of the head, as previously described, and another in the back of the head. And cauterize one cautery on each temple.  If the patient is strong and able to tolerate it, cauterize with the cauteries mentioned for paralysis and weakness of the body, on the cervical and lumbar vertebrae.  The cautery should be olive-oil based, according to the method previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this way.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupted humours and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauteries we have mentioned for paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess of black bile and the patient's body is moist, purge what cleanses his brain as previously described in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of flax like a circle, then place it on the center of his head.  The patient sits upright, holding it from each side. Then take one pound of old sheep's fat.
Then heat it moderately over the fire, as much as the finger can tolerate if inserted into it. Then pour it into the circle on his head and leave it to cool. Do this to the patient once a week with the rest of his good treatment until he is healed, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small, scattered points, without holding the cautery in your hand, but rather by the smoke of it.  This type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton pad soaked in fat or chicken fat to it.
Chapter Twelve.
In the cauterization of water descending into the eye.
If you recognize the descending water in the eye by the signs mentioned in the classification, then immediately treat the patient, cleanse his head, and protect it from all moisture.  Have him sweat in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize a spot in the center of the head, and cauterize two spots on the temples if the water is descending into both eyes, or one spot on one temple if it is descending into one eye.
Then, with the cautery, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin, ensuring the cauterizations extend lengthwise and widthwise across the temples, and guard against blood loss.
If you see any of it, cut it at the site using whatever treatment is possible. We will later discuss the wisdom of clearing the arteries and cutting them while protecting against bleeding.
Two strong cauterizations may be performed at the nape of the neck, under the two bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic weeping sores.
If the weeping of the eye is chronic and persistent, and if it originates from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, externally, and you are certain that it is due to thick, cold, phlegmatic excess, then use the cauterization which I described in the beginning for the descending fluid. One cauterization in the middle of the head, two on the temples, and two at the nape of the neck, beneath the bones.  If further cauterization is needed, apply a cauterization on each side of the tear duct, at the edge of the eyebrow, with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
Concerning the cauterization of foul-smelling nasal discharge.
If the treatment mentioned in the section was not successful, then quickly apply cupping to the patient's temples for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the center with an olive oil cautery iron. Then cauterize with a nail cautery iron, two cauterizations above the eyebrows, slightly under the hair, carefully avoiding the artery; do not cut it.  This is the image of the nail cautery.
Chapter Fifteen.
Concerning the cauterization of eyelid relaxation.
If the eyelid has relaxed due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, spaced apart from the temples, and each cauterization should be the length of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the cauterization; it should only burn a third of the skin. The cautery iron should be of this shape.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its eyelashes turn inward and injure the eye, cauterization has two types. Either cauterization with fire or with a burning medicine.  If cauterizing with fire, first tell the patient to leave his eyelashes alone, if he is one who plucks them, so that they grow long and even.
If it injured it at the time of their growth, bind his eyes with a bandage so they don't move until they grow, and when they have grown and evened out, put the patient's head on your lap, then mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of a leaf.
Begin the mark near the eyelashes, then place a cotton swab dipped in egg white or the juice of the squirting cucumber under the eyelid. Then heat the cautery iron—this is its form.
Then cauterize in the shape you marked, little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin is burned, in the shape of the entire visible whole leaf of rue. A sign of successful work is to see the eyelid contracted and the hair raised from the eye's flesh.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days, then apply a cotton swab with oil until the scab comes off. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair grows back later and the eyelid relaxes.
Then repeat the cauterization at that spot as you did at first. If the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with burning medicine, tell the patient to let the eyelashes grow long and even.
Then make a shape of a rue leaf from paper, and take a weighed amount of ordinary soap and quicklime, one dirham or similar, pulverize them both thoroughly, doing this quickly so they do not dry out. Then spread it [the mixture] on the paper in the shape of a rue leaf and place it on the eyelid, one or both. Place a cotton swab soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on the medicine and gently press it while moving it, whenever the patient feels the medicine burning, because he will feel a burning sensation like fire. As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. If the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And see, if you see the eyelid has risen, as it rises with cauterization by fire or by cutting, otherwise, apply more medicine to the spot where the medicine has not yet affected it and has not darkened, until you complete your work and the eye is cauterized. Then apply cotton with oil to remove the burning sensation.
Then treat it with the date palm ointment or another, until it heals.  You should be extremely careful during the procedure to prevent any medicine from entering the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after several days and we fear something in the eye,
Then apply the medicine again to the relaxed part of the eyelid, specifically as you did at first, and treat it until it heals. This is a picture of a rue leaf.
Know that people's eyes vary in size and age, so adjust your cauterization accordingly. The correct method is not hidden from those experienced in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the nasal polyp that appears in the eye socket.
If you have treated the polyp with the methods described in the sections on diseases, and your treatment is unsuccessful, then it is necessary to cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, and have a servant hold their head firmly, preventing any movement or shaking.
Then place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or the juice of the mulberries on their eyes, and then heat the cautery iron, which is pictured here.
It should be hollow, like the shaft of a hawk's feather on one side where the cauterization will be performed, and if you wish, the other end can be pierced, or if you prefer, it can be solid like a rod. However, the hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then, if the polyp is open, squeeze it and remove the pus, and dry it; or if it is not open, open it and remove the pus, then apply the very hot cautery to it, holding it with your hand until you reach the bone.
Keep your hand slightly away from the eye, towards the nose, during the cauterization, so that you do not miss your mark or upset the patient, and the cautery does not fall on the eyelid and damage it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, then if not, repeat the cauterization another time if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton pad with oil and treat it with the drying ointment until it heals. If after forty days it does not heal, apply the corrosive, sharp medicine until the bone is exposed and remove it according to what will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing the polyp, mentioned by some earlier scholars, is to carefully open the polyp, then insert a thin tube into the opening.  This is what it looks like.
Pour in molten lead weighing a dirham, holding the tube firmly in your hand, and ensuring the patient does not move at all, so that the molten lead does not run into their eye.  You should place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
The lead will burn the polyp, curing it in a remarkable way. If the polyp heals with the cauterization and treatment described, then otherwise, the nasal perforation must be used and the polyp returned to the nasal passage as will be detailed in its dedicated section.
Chapter Eighteen.
Cauterization of cleft lip.
A cleft in the lip, often called a hairlip, frequently occurs, especially in children's lips. If the cleft is treated as described in the classification and the treatment is unsuccessful, then a small, knife-like cautery iron should be applied in this manner.
Make the interior of the cautery as thin as a knife, then apply it to the cleft while hot and quickly until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft; then treat it with qirrot (a medicinal preparation) until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
Cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
If a tumor appears at the base of the gums, or the palate, or the roots of the teeth, then ulcerates and bursts, and a fistula develops from the discharge of pus, and treatment is ineffective, then a cautery should be heated to the size that will fit into the fistula.
Then insert it, hot, into the opening of the fistula, and hold it until the heated iron reaches its bottom and end. Do this once or twice, and then treat it afterward with the treatment we mentioned until it heals, God willing.
If the matter ceases and it heals, otherwise, the place must be examined, and the corrupted bone must be removed, as will be described in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Loose teeth and gums.
If the gums have become loose due to moisture, and the teeth have moved, and treatment with medication has been ineffective, place the patient's head on your lap, then heat the cautery iron, whose image will come after this, after placing the tube on the tooth.
And quickly insert the hot cautery iron into it, and hold your hand a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then remove your hand, then repeat the cautery iron several times as desired, then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water.
And he holds it for an hour and spits it out, then the loose tooth will become firm, and the relaxed gums will become firm and the bad moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-one.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold or worms, and treatment with medication has not worked, cauterization can be done in two ways: either with oil or with fire.
For cauterization with oil, take cow's butter, boil it in an iron spoon or a shell, then take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the end of a rod, dip it into the boiled butter, and place it on the aching tooth quickly, holding it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth; if desired, dip wool or cotton into cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, then place the heated iron on top until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
For cauterization with fire, use a brass or iron tube, somewhat thick-walled so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.  Then heat the cautery iron, place it on the tooth itself, and hold it until the iron cools.  Repeat this several times.
The pain will disappear either on that same day or the next.  Following the cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  This is the shape of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you prefer, as is possible.  This is the shape of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing swine.
If the swine are affected by phlegm and cold humors, and do not respond to maturation with medications, and you desire rapid maturation, then heat the hollow cautery, which has this shape, its ends perforated.
To allow smoke to emerge from the other end during cauterization, place it on the same tumor, once and again if necessary, until reaching the depth of the tumor.  If the tumor is small, adjust the cautery to the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days, and apply a cotton swab soaked in clarified butter to remove what was burned by the fire.  Then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If humidity predominates in the trachea, especially if accompanied by a cold temperament, the patient should first be purged with laxative remedies, then cauterized with a cautery on the notch of the neck, at the base of the throat, in the lowest position.
Take care not to reach the throat with the cautery, and burn only half the skin. Then cauterize again at the joint of the neck, at the last bead of it, intensely.  Use a nail-shaped cautery, as described previously.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned previously until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterizing lung disease and coughs.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the illness is chronic, cauterize twice above the collarbones, in the soft, hollow, depressed areas, and once more in the center of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be in the form of a nail, as previously described.  If you prefer, the cauterization can be done by dripping with a cautery called the "point," whose form was previously described in treating earaches.  The points should be from about thirty to around that number.
Then treat him according to what was previously mentioned, until he is healed.  You can also use a cautery with three prongs, like this, and use it quickly, because you cauterize three times in a single application.  This is the shape of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery moisture, or if it was not fixed when the dislocation was reduced so that it becomes a habit to relocate and then dislocate at the slightest movement as we have observed, then the joint must first be reduced. Then the patient lies on their back or on their right side, and the skin inside the armpit is pulled upward with the fingers of your left hand if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then the double-pointed cautery, whose image is this, is heated.
Then the skin is cauterized with it until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization is four cauterizations.  Sometimes it is cauterized with a three-pointed cautery, in which case the shape of the cauterization is six cauterizations, and the points are on the thinness of the tissue.
And this is the image of the three-pointed cautery.
And one more may be added to this number, making eight cauterizations. Then the crushed balls with salt are applied to the cauterization. The patient should remain at rest and not move the limb for a period of time until it strengthens. If the dislocation was upwards, this is rare.
Cauterize above the shoulder blade with one good nail-like cauterization, or many small cauterizations.  The joint will strengthen, the moisture will disappear, and the patient will recover.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If the stomach is affected by excessive cold and moisture, disrupting its balance, and frequent ailments occur despite various treatments, the patient should lie on their back, with legs and arms extended, and then be cauterized three times. Cauterize under the breastbone with a nail-shaped cautery to the extent of a finger.  Two additional cauteries should be placed below, one on each side, forming a triangular shape.  The cauteries should be spaced far enough apart so as not to coalesce if they become infected.  The depth of the cauterization should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.  The shape of the cauteries should be [as described].
In this manner and to this extent, and no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cautery in the center of the stomach, in this manner.
The cautery used for this single cauterization should be circular in shape, in this manner.
The stomach can also be cauterized by puncturing.  For those who fear this cauterization, mark the stomach with dots of the desired size using ink, then cauterize them with a pointed cautery, and then treat them with the previously described remedies until they heal.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If a cold, damp, or excessively hot-wind affliction affects the liver, causing it to depart from its natural state, and the remedies described in the preceding classifications have failed. The patient should lie on their back, and three cauteries of this shape and size must be marked on the liver, situated below the clavicles, where the human forearm ends.
Each cautery should be about the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization should be applied along the body in a straight line. Do not press the cautery iron tightly.
The depth of the burn should be no more than half the thickness of the skin.  The patient should stand on their feet, or if unable, lie down with their legs extended and arms raised. This is the form of the cautery iron.
You may perform these cauteries with a sharp-pointed cautery iron, if you have skill and dexterity in the craft, taking care not to over-cauterize and burn all the skin, thus reaching the abdomen and the intestines, for the skin there is thin.  Be aware of this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
Cauterization of a liver tumor.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you want to determine whether the swelling is in the liver's flesh or its membrane, if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient will experience heaviness and pain, but without intensity.
If it is in the liver's membrane, the pain will be intense and severe.  If the physicians have exhausted their treatment attempts, the patient should lie on their back, and the swollen area should be marked with ink.
Then, heat the cautery iron in the fire; it is a cautery iron resembling a plowshare, and this is its image. Cauterize it with a single cautery, until all the skin is burned and the cautery reaches the membrane, so that all the matter is expelled.  Then treat it as an abscess until it heals.
This type of cautery should only be performed by someone who has extensive experience in medicine and has treated these illnesses repeatedly by experience.  Only then should one undertake such a procedure; to avoid it is better.
Chapter Twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients recommended cauterizing cold fistulas with the roots of the zarawand plant.  Take one long, dry root of the zarawand, as thick as a finger.  Dip it in oil and then hold it in the fire. Then cauterize once between the collarbone and the neck, and two small cauterizations a little below the veins, sloping towards the area under the chin.  And two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backwards.  Another cauterization in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. Three cauterizations on the back, one between the shoulders, and two on the sides of the groin, below the cauterization between the collarbones.
One should not make the cauterization deep, but rather on the surface of the skin, lightly. Some of the ancients have mentioned that some people used an iron cautery, similar to a spatula, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reaches the affected area.
The pus will drain as described for liver tumors, and in this case, cauterizing the abscess carries the risk of the patient dying immediately, or of a persistent fistula forming at the site.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If treatment of splenic disease, as described in the previous section, proves ineffective, cauterization is appropriate in three ways, all correct: one is to cauterize the spleen three or four times, in a line along its length.
In the same manner as cauterizing the liver, described previously, and with the same cauterizing instrument; the distance between each cauterization should be the thickness of a finger, or slightly more; the patient should lie on their back.
The other method is at the elbow; elevate the skin opposite the spleen, where the patient's left elbow ends, raising the skin the width of the body, so the cauterizations run along the body's length.
Then, very carefully insert the cauterizing probes, so they pierce the skin on the opposite side; remove the cautery.  The cauterizations will thus be four.  If desired, a three-pronged cautery may be used.
Then treat the cauterized area after allowing the pus to drain for many days; this is more effective than any other prior treatment.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is beneficial specifically in ascites. If, after treating the person with dropsy using the methods we have described in the sections, your treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize four times around the navel and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen, and two behind his back—one opposite his chest and the other opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then leave the cauterization open to drain pus for a long time.
Do not neglect the patient's treatment after cauterization, providing the necessary care to bring the affected areas together, so that healing occurs quickly.  The cautery iron used for the back is pointed, as previously described, and the one for the other areas is olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If the feet and legs swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot at the point between the little and ring fingers.
Hold your hand with the cautery iron straight, do not bend it. Then lift your hand and do not put it back down, for the yellow water will drain out, and the cautery iron will be in this shape.
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg. The cauterization should be with the sharp end of the cautery iron, along the length of the leg: one below the knee, the other lower down towards the middle of the leg.  And two cauterizations on each thigh.
Leave the cauterizations open without treatment for a long time, allowing the water to drain.  Then treat them with the rest of the methods we have mentioned.
The thirty-third chapter.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and moisture, weakening the digestive and binding forces in the stomach and intestines, and other treatments have failed to cure it, and you see the patient is strong enough to withstand cauterization, then cauterize a large area on his stomach. As previously described, cauterize the stomach with a circular cautery iron.  Then apply four cauterizations around the navel using a fine, pointed cautery iron.  Apply one or two large cauterizations to the lower back, above the coccyx.
If you see abundant moisture and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize a spot on the pubic area and a spot on each hip.  Perhaps add two small cauterizations near the large one on the stomach; this is a successful and unfailing treatment, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are many chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, or a single one, and they are composed of thick, cold humors or putrid moisture, and treatment as described in the section did not succeed, then cauterize the patient with three cauterizations on the lower part of the sacral spine, slightly below the table, in a triangular shape.
And cauterize a spot below the navel the size of two fingers.  If you judge that the patient's stomach is cold, and their food is not digesting, and you see their face swollen, then cauterize the stomach with a large cauterization as previously described, and cauterize the liver. And another on the spleen with a nail-shaped cautery. Leave the cauterization open for a time, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery that resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart and press firmly until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood is flowing. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal.  If a large cauterization is applied to the cotton, it will be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula in the perineum and its surrounding areas.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and procedure we described in its place, and avoids it, he may heal by cauterization.  If a fistula occurs and has persisted, discharging pus and corrupted humors, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then determine the depth of its penetration with the probe.  Then heat the cauterizing iron, which resembles a blade.  Insert it hot into the same fistula, aligning it with the depth of the fistula and the extent the probe entered. Repeat the cauterization until all the corrupt matter is burned, once, twice, or three times, as needed.
And be careful not to burn a nerve if there is one, or a large vein, if the fistula opens into the bladder or the intestines.
And be cautious of all these locations.  You should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area, and you assess that it is not perforating. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area seals shut, and the discharges stop, and it remains like this for a time, know that it has healed completely.
If the discharges do not stop, know that it is perforating, or there is a corrupted bone in its depth, or something similar, which will be discussed in its proper place.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On the cauterization of the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or thick wind, and the patient's sexual activity is diminished as a result, it is necessary to cauterize the kidneys on the buttocks, one cauterization on each kidney, using the nail-shaped cautery mentioned previously.  One might cauterize a third time on the same spot, resulting in three cauterizations aligned, which will be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot control urination, cauterize once below the navel, on the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and another cauterization to the right of the navel and one to the left.
After cauterization on each side, the size should be like the width of a thumb's ring. Cauterize once, or twice if necessary, on the lower back.  The cautery should be the nail-shaped one, as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If the uterus has a buildup of cold and dampness, causing infertility, or makes childbirth difficult, or if pain occurs during childbirth, then three cauterizations should be applied around the navel, as we described for cauterizing the bladder. One cauterization on the lumbar region below the back, or two, using a nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Erroneous humidity may build up in the hip joint, causing dislocation.  A sign is that one leg is longer than the other when compared; and if the dislocated area is examined, a gap is found.  It is necessary to cauterize the affected area on the hip joint itself with a roughly circular cauterization.
After applying the cautery around the joint so that the joint itself lies in the center of the circle, and using the cautery pictured in the stomach cauterization section. If that cautery is not available, perform three cauterizations with the large olive cautery.
Make the cauterization deep to the thickness of the entire skin, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-one.
In cauterizing the sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint caused by cold and dampness, and you have treated the patient as described in the classification, but the treatment is ineffective and the condition persists, then the patient should be relieved of the thick humors by taking  rotten fruit or prickly pear fruit, or similar remedies.
Then cauterize.  The cauterization has two forms: either with burning medications, or with fire.  Cauterization with fire can be done in various ways, one of which is to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
This produces a suitable depth.  The distance between each cauterization should be about the thickness of a finger. The cautery should be olive-colored.  A cauterization can also be made in the center, on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations in total. If desired, cauterize with the circular method previously mentioned for dislocated hip, using a single cauterization.
So that the circle surrounds the entire hip and burns the entire thickness of the skin. This is the method of cauterization for sciatica, if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize with two cauterizations on the thigh in the location where the patient indicates pain, and a cauterization above the heel, about four fingers to the outer side.  The cautery should be bladed, and the depth of the cauterization should only be the thickness of the skin.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize there with the pointed cautery three, four, or more times, if needed.  If the pain is indicated below the knee, towards the leg, cauterize there with a single bladed cauterization.
In all your cauterizations, be careful not to reach a nerve or major artery, lest you inflict a grave injury or ailment upon the patient.
I have observed one and another who cauterized above the heel and overdid the cauterization, resulting in gangrene of the leg, reaching down to the foot and its complete ulceration, ruining the entire leg.  Subsequently, diarrhea and death ensued. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize them in precisely the same manner.
Some scholars among the wise have described a hip cauterization with these characteristics: a cup-like instrument is made of iron, with a diameter of half a span.  Its opening is the thickness of a date pit, or slightly less.  Inside this cup is another cup, and a third cup.
The distance between each cup is the width of a thumb.  All the cups are open on both sides and their height is approximately one or two thumbs.  A handle is fitted to the cups, made of iron. This is its form.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and sparks fly.  It is then placed upon the affected hip, with the patient resting on the healthy side.  Three circular cauterizations are performed at once.  Then, the patient is left for three days, bandaged with clarified butter, and the wound is left open for several days.
Then it is treated with ointment until healed. The author of this book said that this type of cauterization is rarely used because of its unpleasantness and frightening appearance, and few can endure it.  However, it is a good cauterization for those who can endure it and are afflicted in that location.
As for cauterization with burning medications, it is done by creating two cups resembling the throat where the latch of the door goes, made of copper or iron.
There will be a height of about two thumbs on each side of them, and the distance between them will be the thickness of a finger.  The bottom and top of the cups are open, and they are joined together in this manner.
Then, place them on the affected hip, with the patient lying on their healthy side.  Hold your hand gently, then pour a little heated, sharp water between the two circles.  Hold it for about the duration of an hour glass.  The patient must endure the sting and burn, as it will feel like fire.
Until the sting subsides. Then remove the instrument and wipe the affected hip with fresh water, completely removing the sharp water. Leave it for three days, applying grease, until the blackness of the burn disappears.  Leave it for some days, allowing pus to drain; it is most beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.  If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold that holds the water, in the same way as you did for the hip.  This is a description of sharp water.  It has been proven in my treatise on the preparation of remedies.
Take one part of caustic soda and one part of quicklime. Grind them together and place them in a new pot with a single small hole at the bottom, large enough for a pestle to enter. Place another glazed pot underneath the bottom of the first pot.
Pour fresh water over the soda and lime, enough to cover them by a finger's breadth, after pressing them well with your hand.  Let the pot stand until the sharp water descends into the glazed pot below. Then collect all that water and pour it over fresh lime and fresh soda.
Then it will be extremely sharp and effective in many medical procedures and cauterization of other parts of the body, as it acts like fire itself.  There are also other medicines that can cauterize the hip, such as thafsīya, balaḏir honey, and lime mixed with soap, all ground up.
Galen recounted a story about an ancient physician's treatment for hip pain and sciatica, greatly praising it, claiming that it needed no other treatment and cured the condition in a single application.
Even, perhaps, a patient would be carried into a bath and emerge cured.  One takes fresh green shiṭraj, or if no green is available, fresh dried shiṭraj, grinds it with some fat, and applies it to the hip where it hurts, or to the leg or thigh.
Apply the compress and leave it on for three hours, or until the patient feels the burning subside.  Then, bathe the patient.  If the body is sweating, place them in a basin.  The pain will disappear and the patient will recover, God willing. If not, reapply the dressing after ten days.
Then the patient will recover, God willing.  Know that no one should use these medicines for cauterization unless the body is emptied.  Dioscorides has mentioned that goat's dung, when used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization is performed as follows:  Take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep area between the thumb and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat dung.
Set it ablaze with fire until it becomes ember, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes.  Repeat this until sensation reaches from the middle of the upper arm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing.  This type of cauterization is called cauterization with dung.
Chapter Forty-two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Pain in the back may arise from many causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like.  It may result from the accumulation of a cold, moist substance.  Cauterization is only effective in this particular type of pain.
After the patient has vomited, and after applying a rotten herb or similar remedies, one should cauterize the back where the pain is located in three rows, each the width of the table.  Mark the area with ink, and apply five cauterizations (or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength) to each row.
Use a pinpoint cautery iron, or if preferred, use a medium-sized nail-shaped cautery iron for three or four cauterizations, following this method.
Chapter Forty-three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a swelling.
This ailment frequently affects young children.  A sign of its initial stage in a child is shortness of breath when standing or moving, and at the end of the spine's vertebrae, a prominent swelling will appear, protruding beyond the other vertebrae.
If you see this and wish to stop its progress, cauterize it with a circular cautery iron, shaped like this. Apply the cauterization evenly to each side of the vertebra.  If you prefer, cauterize around the vertebra with a pinpoint cautery iron, in rows of two or three, keeping the points close together.  Then treat the area until it heals as described.
Beware that cauterization should not be used on a swelling caused by nerve tension.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are caused by cold dampness affecting any part of the body, if the pain occurs in the legs, physicians customarily call it gout, particularly.
If cold gout, the cause, is treated with the methods we have mentioned in the classification and the pains do not subside, then cauterization will alleviate them.  Cauterize around the joints of the legs with many cauteries after vomiting. The cautery should be olive-oil based, of medium heat, in this manner.
And if you need to cauterize on the face of the leg, use a point cautery.  If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, as often happens, cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries on each side using the same olive-oil based cautery.
If you need more cauterization, cauterize, but do not dig deeply with the cautery; it should only penetrate the thickness of the skin.  If the pain ascends to the hips or back, use the cauterization described in its appropriate section.
If the pain is only in the hands, cauterize around the wrists in a circular fashion, forming two lines. If the pain remains in the fingers, cauterize each knuckle and the palm of the hand with a single point. If the pain ascends to the elbows or shoulders after a few days,
Cauterize both of them [the elbows or shoulders] from every side.  The patient must also take good care and use medicine; if he has a good diet and eliminates phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some intestines and bowel contents descend to the testicle, and this is a recent onset, then the patient should be instructed to avoid food that day and use laxatives to evacuate the bowels.
Then, have the patient lie on their back before you, instructing them to hold themselves until the bowel contents or intestines emerge.  Then, push them back using your finger.  Then, mark the area under the hernia on the pubic bone with ink, a mark resembling a semicircle, its ends extending towards the upper body.
Then, heat a cautery iron, its image being like this.
Until it becomes white, throwing off sparks. Then, push the bowel or contents back into the abdomen.  Then, a servant should place their hand on the area to prevent the bowel from protruding.  The patient's legs should be spread apart, and a cushion placed underneath them. Another servant should tie their legs together.
Another servant should hold the patient's hands on their chest. Then, place the cautery iron on the same mark, your hand holding the cautery iron straight, until it reaches the bone, or repeat the process again if it does not reach the bone on the first attempt.
Maintain your effort to prevent the bowel from protruding while cauterizing, so as not to burn the patient, causing either death or a great calamity.  Know that if your cauterization does not reach the bone, your work will not be successful.  The cautery iron should be gentle for children, according to their size, and for adults, according to their size.
Then, treat the cauterized area with ghee after three days, to remove the harshness of the burn.  Then treat it with other ointments until it heals.  Let the patient lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is closed.
His food during his treatment should be soft, to prevent the bowel from protruding during bowel movements.  Then, if he wishes to stand up after forty days, a firm bandage should be used and kept on for another forty days.  Reduce the strain and fullness from food, drink, and loud noises.
If this treatment is applied as described, he will heal completely, God willing. I will discuss the treatment of hernias by incision in its appropriate section, God willing.  As for a hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is recent, if you want it not to worsen, cauterize the hernia with a circular cautery, to the extent of its size. Let the amount of skin burned be about a third of it, then treat it as described.  It will not worsen, God willing. Some earlier physicians mentioned that the hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery iron in this manner.
After marking the hernia with ink, make a line across the top of the hernia, and another line down below it.  Then, use a single, nail-like cautery in the middle. The initial cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-six.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If a part of the body suffers from a fall or blow, causing pain that persists for a long time and is not relieved by medication, it should be cauterized with a pinpoint cautery. The cauterization of each body part should be in accordance with its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
This will relieve the pain and the fistula. If the patient is cured by the first cauterization, then it is good. Otherwise, the cauterization should be repeated, because it is the nature of these ailments to spread from the affected part to those nearby. Therefore, cauterization should be applied until the patient is cured.
Chapter Forty-seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for those with leprosy, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that results from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize him, examine him.  If the leprosy is in its early stages and you have treated it as described in the classification, and it has not declined or stopped, and you fear that the corruption will spread to the patient's entire temperament, cauterize the head five times. One in the usual center of the head, a second below it, towards the forehead near the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one from behind on the nape of the neck.  Apply the cautery somewhat firmly until it affects the bone slightly.
Scales will peel away, making it easier for thick vapors to escape.  Cauterize the spleen with a cauterization as previously described.  However, if the leprosy has persisted and become clearly evident, it is appropriate to cauterize the head in the manner described above. One cauterization on the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the thoracic vertebrae, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the spine and another above it on the same surface, and two on each thigh, one on each hip. Two on each knee, one on each, two on each shoulder, two on each elbow, two on the ribs of the chest, and a cauterization on each joint of his fingers and toes, and on each heel of his feet and on each wrist.
Preserve the nerve behind the heels so as not to burn them.  A cauterization may be applied to the pubic bone, another to the stomach opening, and another to the liver.  Know that the more cauterizations you apply, the more effective and beneficial they will be.
Know that the patient feels less pain from the cauterization than a healthy person, because his body has become numb.  The cauterizing tools should vary in size according to the organs and joints, as previously described regarding the properties of the instruments.
Then treat the cauterization with fine crushed cumin seeds, honey, and other remedies until he is healed, God willing.
The forty-eighth chapter.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness. When a part of the body has become numb and has been treated with medicines, ointments, and bandages, but has not healed, cauterize the same numb part with cauterizations according to the size of the affected body part, and let your cauterizations be slightly deeper in thicker skin.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals.  Cauterization may be used for some numbness that affects the hand or foot, in the spinal vertebrae at the exit point of the nerve that moves that limb, to relieve the numbness.
Only those who are knowledgeable about the anatomy of organs and the exits of the nerves that move the body should undertake this.
The forty-ninth chapter.
Concerning the cauterization of leprosy.
If leprosy persists and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it with a moderate depth, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil, and the leaves of the horsetail plant, and dove's blood or the blood of vultures (each in equal parts). Mix them together, apply to a cloth, and keep the area covered until it heals.
The fiftieth chapter.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular iron around it, as it revolves. Some scholars have suggested a severe cauterization in the middle, but I do not agree with this, as I anticipate that it will ulcerate, and I have witnessed this several times.
Therefore, the correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we stated, or with many small cauterizations.
The fifty-first chapter.
Concerning the cauterization of boils.
If a boil has occurred and is slow to mature, either due to the agent that caused it, or because of the patient's age (if the patient is elderly and anemic), or due to time, and you wish to hasten its maturation, then cauterize around it with many small, puncturing cauterizations.
Then leave it, for this will hasten its maturation.  If you wish to further cauterize it, heat the cautery iron, which is depicted in this image.
And place it in the center of the boil until the skin is pierced.  Let the cauterization be on the underside, so that the pus may drain easily.  Then treat it as appropriate until healed.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
On cauterizing ulcers.
Ulcers are nothing but corruption that consumes the tissue, just as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place where cauterization with fire is appropriate, heat a cautery iron with many small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains. Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scab and corruption are removed.
Then treat it with healing ointments. If you see that after three days the flesh grows healthy and without corruption, then leave it be; otherwise, repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas. Ulcers can also be treated with strong medication.
For it is faster and more effective than using fire, and I have already mentioned the treatment of ulcers with strong medication in the classification, so refer to it there when needed.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This affliction, a rough sore that causes pain to the foot, often occurs in the soles of the feet.  The cauterization can be performed in two ways: either by fire or by a strong caustic liquid.
As for cauterization by fire, heat a hollowed-out cautery iron, resembling an eagle's beak, made of iron, that is sized to encompass the nail on all sides and thin at the edges. Then, bring the hot cautery down onto the nail and turn your hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the nail's depth.
Leave it for three days, allowing pus to form, then bandage it with crushed wild barley mixed with salt, leaving the dressing on overnight. It will detach from its roots. Then, treat the wound with a healing ointment until it is healed, if the nails are not inverted.
It often occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet.  A tube of copper, iron, or eagle's beak should be used to press onto the nail or wart.  Then, a small amount of strong caustic liquid is poured into the tube.
Hold the tube with your hand, gently rotating it to ensure that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail and the strong caustic liquid penetrates to the root of the nail. The patient should endure the stinging of the strong caustic liquid for a while.
Then, leave it; the nail will detach from its roots.  Do this with each one until you have dealt with all of them on the body.  Then treat the sites where they detached with ointments that promote healing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On cauterization.
If a person has a painful condition due to cold in the nerve, or fever, or other causes, one should cauterize four or five times on the back of the spine, one cauterization between each bead, and one on the chest. And on his stomach, one cauterization with the olive oil cautery, for the painful condition will subside and quickly mature the cold disease.
Chapter Fifty-five.
On cauterizing a wound occurring on the body.
Ugly boils may arise on the body from thick, corrupt cold matter.  Upon their first appearance, a gentle cauterization should be applied to the head of each boil with a heated stick, having its end ignited with fire, or with a long piece of willow, or with a lens cautery.
Boils may be cauterized in their initial stages in this manner.  The beneficial effect will not increase, and the illness will not subside unless the patient has been bled beforehand.
Chapter Fifty-six.
On cauterizing bleeding that occurs when an artery is cut.
Bleeding frequently occurs from an artery severed during an external wound, or when incising a tumor, or cauterizing a limb, or similar procedures, and it is difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly apply your index finger to the mouth of the artery, pressing firmly until the blood is contained beneath your finger and nothing escapes. Then, place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and heat them until they are extremely hot.
Then, take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery ruptured, and apply the cautery to the same vein after quickly removing your finger, holding the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If, when you remove your finger from the artery's opening and extinguish the cautery, the blood spurts out again, quickly take another cautery from the prepared fire and continue this process with one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve, lest another affliction befall the patient. Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially a large one, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by amputation if it has not already been severed. If it is severed, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop. Or, it can be tightly tied with threads, or the drugs that stop the flow and bind it tightly can be applied.
As for those who attempt to stop it with a bandage, or by tightening with cloths, or by applying burning substances, and the like, it will not stop in this way, except rarely.  If someone experiences this and is not attended by a physician or by medicine, then let him immediately place the index finger over the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
He should press it firmly until the blood is contained and flows from above the wound and onto the artery and finger.  The finger should not be removed from there with constantly very cold water until the blood solidifies and thickens and stops.  Meanwhile, consider what cauterization or medicine is needed.
Chapter Two.
Concerning incisions, punctures, bloodletting, and wounds, and similar things.
Khalaf said: We have already discussed in the first chapter all diseases treatable by cauterization with fire and burning medications, and their causes, reasons, and instruments, and the different kinds of cauteries, arranging this from the front to the back as chapters.
And I will follow the same path in this chapter so that the student may readily grasp what they seek.
Before I begin with that, you children, it is necessary to know that this chapter contains more uncertainties than the first chapter on cauterization.
For this reason, the warnings in this chapter must be more severe, because in this chapter, the practice often involves expelling the blood, on which life depends, when opening a vein or cutting a tumor, puncturing an abscess, treating a wound, extracting an arrow, cutting a stone, and similar situations, all of which are accompanied by uncertainty and fear, and in most of them, death occurs.
And I advise you to avoid what is questionable.  For in this craft, there may come before you people of various kinds with many illnesses. Among them, some will have grown weary of their disease, and consider death as light.
Because of the severity of their illness and the prolonged suffering, and because of the signs of death present in their illness, some will offer you their wealth, hoping for health.  Their illness is deadly.  Therefore, you should absolutely not accept help from those who exhibit these characteristics.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness. Do not undertake anything like that unless you have certain knowledge of a favorable outcome. In all your treatment of patients, use the knowledge and forewarning of what will become of their health.
For in that, you will gain praise, glory, remembrance, and thanks. May God inspire you, my children, with wisdom, and not deprive you of correctness and success.  For it is in His power; there is no god but Him.
I have arranged the chapters of this section, following on from the previous section on cauterization, from the head to the foot, so that you may find what you seek, God willing.
Chapter One.
On treating the water that collects in the heads of children.
This ailment frequently affects children at birth if the midwife presses the child's head roughly.  It may also arise from a hidden, unknown cause.
I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than children, and all those I have seen have died quickly. Therefore, I have decided to abandon treatment for it. I have seen a child whose head filled with water and the head grew larger each day. Until the child could not sit up due to the enlargement of their head, and the moisture increased until they perished.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone or under the bone on the peritoneum.  If the moisture is between the skin and bone and the swelling is small, then a single horizontal incision should be made in the center of the head, about two finger-widths long, to allow the moisture to drain. This is the image of the scalpel.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling larger, make two intersecting incisions in this manner.
If the moisture is under the bone, and the sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and the water sinks if you press it with your hand inward (this should be clear to you), then three incisions should be made in the center of the head in this manner.
After the incision, all the moisture will come out. Then the incisions should be tightened with bandages and splints.  Afterwards, apply poultices of herbs and oil to the area, up to five days.  Then, the bandages are removed, and the wound is treated with ointments.  Do not allow the head to be too tight. The patient should eat a diet of dry foods, low in moisture.
Until the affected area is strong and healed. Another method of incision is to look at where the bone of the swelling and the accumulation of water is visible, as it may be more prominent in the back of the head, the front, or on the right or left side.
Aim the incision where the swelling and accumulation of water are evident.  Make the incision as you can, taking care not to cut an artery, causing bleeding, which would lead to the patient's death from that bleeding while expelling the moisture.
The Second Chapter.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears, known as the "hissers".
If someone experiences a severe affliction in the eyes or chest, and treatment with medicine is ineffective, the best treatment is to cut these two arteries.
If you wish to cut them, you must first shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the artery.  Then, hold the patient's neck by his/her garment.  Then look where the pulse beats, at the two sunken locations behind the ears. They are rarely hidden, except in some individuals.
Then mark them with ink.  Then cut them with a blunt dissecting knife, down to the bone, cutting across the breadth of the head. Or, if you wish, you insert the dissecting knife under the artery and draw it upwards in a cut, the length of the cut being about two clenched fingers.
When the artery is cut, the blood will flow in a pulsating manner, spurting forward in a continuous stream.  If the artery is not visible to the touch, you should measure from the ear by about three fingers, then mark with ink and cut to the bone.  What is necessary...
Approximately six ounces of blood will likely flow immediately.  Sometimes more or less, depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries. Then, observe the wound. If any part of the peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it off.
So that a hot swelling does not occur.  Then, bind the wound with a linen thread, and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
The arteries in the temples.
If a person experiences chronic headaches or acute ailments caused by sharp moisture and heat in the temple muscles, or severe, chronic headaches, and the usual medical treatments have been unsuccessful, then we have tried, in these cases, to cauterize or cut the arteries of the temples, as we have described.
The procedure for cutting them is that the patient's hair in the temples should be shaved, and the visible artery in the temple should be located.  Its pulse will make it evident; it is rarely hidden, except in certain individuals.
Or, in cases of severe cold, if it is not visible, the patient should tighten their neck with their clothing.  Then, you should rub the area with a cloth or apply hot water until the artery clearly and distinctly appears. Then take the lancet, which is depicted in this way. Then, gently slice the skin with the lancet until you reach the artery.  Then, insert a hook and pull it upwards, bringing it out from the skin and freeing it from the membranes beneath on all sides. If the artery is thin, twist it with the hook's end. Then, cut off a portion where its ends are separated and contracted, and no bleeding occurs. If it is not severed and not cut, the blood will not be quelled at all.  Then, drain from six to three ounces of blood.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong doubled thread, whether of silk or bowstrings, so that the wound will not fester before healing, causing bleeding.
Then cut off the excess between the ligatures; do this at that time or later, if you wish to cauterize to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery, so that its ends are severed, this will accomplish the same work or even better, as we have said.
However, if the patient has a fever or a heated temperament, since cauterization helps to consume moisture, it will be even more beneficial.  After dissecting the arteries, the area should be packed with old cotton and firm bandages applied.  After healing, treat with dry medicines that promote flesh growth and with dressings until healed, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your procedure, immediately cauterize it, or fill the area with alum and hold your hand firmly until the bleeding stops. If nothing of that sort is available, place your finger over the site to cause clotting.
Apply intensely cold water to the area until the inflammation subsides and it is properly tightened.  A simpler and easier alternative to dissecting the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the two places with ink.
Heat it intensely until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed at two points so that the ends are separated.  It will not heal with this cauterization.  This is a picture of the cautery.
The double-bladed cautery should be sharp, resembling small knives, but significantly less sharp than a knife.  If they were as sharp as a knife, the cold would reach it quickly and the flesh would not separate quickly.  If there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire will adhere to it.
It quickly cuts through the flesh. This method is superior, easier, and simpler than any other method.  The distance between the blades should be the thickness of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
In the treatment of persistent hot weeping from the eyes.
If the weeping is constant and originates from the veins on the skull's exterior, and if no medicinal treatment provides any benefit, and you see the patient's face reddened... He feels a creeping sensation in his forehead, like an ant's crawl, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their edges eroded, and their eyelids stuck together due to the intensity of the tears.  Early practitioners of treatment resorted to this procedure, and they call it "treatment by the sword." It involves instructing the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made on the forehead, lengthwise, each incision approximately two fingers long, parallel to the nose's length in the center of the forehead, the second slightly offset from the temporal muscle action, and the third on the opposite side.
Care must be taken to avoid cutting the arteries on either side, and keep your hand away from the jaw's contact.  After each incision, leave a space of three fingers' width.  Have with you sponges or many dry cloths to absorb the blood.
Then, insert the sharp, double-ended scalpel, which has this form. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, use it to detach all the skin and periosteum between the incisions. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, and then remove the scalpel. And insert into the first incision another instrument, called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth/blunt on the other, which has this form.
Place the sharp side of the scalpel upward, toward the flesh attached to the skin, and the smooth side toward the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle incision, and sever all the vessels that run from the head to the eyes, without cutting the surface skin.
Then do the same in the middle incision to the other incision. After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, compress the areas of clotted blood.  Then, in each incision, place a cotton wick, and apply a dressing soaked in a mixture of syrup, oil, or vinegar and oil.
So that a hot swelling does not occur. On the third day, dissolve the ligaments, and apply a lot of lukewarm water. Then treat with basil ointment and rose oil, and other remedies used for wounds, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of tears and discharges from the inside of the head to the eyes.
When someone has frequent, severe, persistent discharges, and the eyes appear sunken and small, and vision is weak, and the eyelids are ulcerated, and eyelashes are falling out. And there will be a severe, painful ache deep within the head, and repeated sneezing.  Know from these symptoms that these fluids and discharges come from many deep veins.  The best treatment for this is to have the patient shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the center of the forehead.
And there will be a severe, painful ache deep within the head, and repeated sneezing.  Know from these symptoms that these fluids and discharges come from many deep veins.  The best treatment for this is to have the patient shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the center of the forehead. Or raise it slightly in width, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple. The incision should be into the bone, keeping your hand away from the movable masseter muscles when chewing.  Once the bone is exposed and all the blood has been wiped away with a sponge...
Then separate the edges of the incision with used cotton or linen thread, and secure it from above with sutures.  Soak the sutures with medicine and oil so as not to cause a hot swelling.  When you have resolved it and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should rub the bone so that flesh begins to grow there.
Then treat it with a dried preparation that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts of a substance called *qalfuniya* and preparing a salve from them, which is used to stimulate flesh growth in wounds like these.
Chapter Six.
On treating what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic or semi-metallic stone, like iron or glass; or a plant seed, like chickpeas or nuts, and the like; or a liquid, such as water or vinegar, and similar things.
Or it is an animal.  If a stone or something similar that does not grow within the ear has fallen in, expose the ear to the sun.  If you see the stone, place some violet or ceruce oil in it, then try to remove it by moving the head or by inducing sneezing with a stick. And close the nostrils when sneezing occurs, after placing a bandage of linen or wool around the ear and extending the ear upward. Often, this treatment removes the object. If it does not, try removing it with gentle gauze, which has this form.
If it comes out with the gauze, otherwise, try to remove it with a gentle, slightly bent, blind hook.  If it doesn't come out with that either, make a brass tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal.
Seal the area around the tube with softened pitch mixed with oil so that the wind has no passage except through the tube. Then pull it out with a strong pull.  This often removes it. If it does not come out with the methods described, take a small piece of Nabataean gum or a bird-catching gum and place it on the end of the tube.
After wrapping it tightly with a piece of cotton, gently insert it into the ear canal after the ear has dried from moisture.  If none of the described methods remove it, proceed to incision before a severe abscess or inflammation occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient from the temples, drawing blood according to the patient's strength. Then, place the patient before you and turn their ear upward. Make a small incision at the base of the ear, near the cartilage, in the lower portion of the ear.
Make the incision in a crescent shape until you reach the stone. Then remove it with whatever instruments are available. Then stitch the incision immediately and treat it until it heals.
If the object lodged in the ear is one of the types that swells and increases in size, try to remove it with the methods described. If this does not work, take a thin, delicate probe of this type.
Try to cut that type of fallen ear bean with it, but only do so if you are certain that the bean has become moistened by ear vapor, forming numerous small pieces. Then remove them with a blind probe, a gentle cloth, or suction.
As we mentioned, it is easier to remove [the object].  Regarding water entering the ear, the patient should first try sneezing with the kunds or, lying on the affected ear, filling it with old cotton. If this works.
Otherwise, take several small, smooth stones, warm them slightly by fire, and have the patient insert one into the ear canal. The patient should then place their foot on the affected side and strike another stone against the stone in the ear.
He should continue doing this with stone after stone until all the water is expelled. Water may also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and burning the other end until it is mostly consumed. Then use another feather.
Repeat this process until all the water is removed, or extract it using the tube, as previously described for stones. As for removing an animal that has entered the ear, if it is small, such as a flea or similar, treat it as described in the section [earlier].  As for...
If it is large enough to be felt, try removing it with swabs and hooks.  This is easier than all the other things that can occur in the ear.  As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if you have treated them as described in the section on worms and your treatment is ineffective.
You should look into the ear in the sunlight. If you see any worms, remove them with swabs or delicate hooks. If you do not see any, take a tube—this is its form.
It is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. Insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate, then apply strong suction. Repeat this several times until all the worms are expelled. If this does not work, seal around the tube with wax, as I described for stones.
If it is not expelled by the methods described, use the ear drops as previously mentioned, which the ancients used to kill worms.  You will find this in the section on ear drops.  Use this instrument to instill ointments and medications into the ear. This is its image.
As you see, it is made of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top.  If you prefer, the projectile within the tube can be made of secure copper.  Alternatively, you can take a cord and tightly wrap cotton around one end.
Then place the ointment, juice, or any medication you desire into the tube, while it is in the ear.  Then, using the cord with cotton, press gently with your hand until the ointment enters the ear canal and the patient feels it.
Administer it to the patient internally.  Ensure that whatever you instill into the ear is warmed slightly in the fire. Be careful that the substance is neither excessively cold nor excessively hot, as the ear cannot tolerate such extremes.
Chapter Seven.
In treating ear obstructions.
Some children may be born with their ear canals unpierced.
Some people may also suffer from obstructions in the ear canal, caused by wounds or growths. This obstruction may be located deep within the ear canal, and therefore unseen.
Occasionally, it may be slightly exposed outside the ear canal, and thus visible.  Those obstructions deep within the ear, invisible to the eye, are most often difficult to cure, while those visible to the eye should be placed in the sun. And examine it.  If you see the obstruction externally, open it with a gentle scalpel, with this image in mind:
Its tip should have a small, limited projection, and the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides to avoid harming the ear. If the obstruction is due to a growth within the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate forceps and cut it gently until all of the growth is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a smooth, gentle probe, heat it slightly in the fire, and insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction, along with the patient's experience of a hearing impairment, gently remove it.
Be careful not to injure the eardrum.  Then, place a wick within the ear, sized appropriately to the width of the canal, and apply a coating of Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days until you are sure the wound has healed. Alternatively, take a wick, soak it in water, and dust it with powdered zea.
Use it.  If you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot tumor, you should remove the wick and replace it with another soaked in ointment made with rose oil, to reduce the hot swelling.  Then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear.  Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the section on cauterization.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts appearing on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  One should grasp them with a forceps or a hook and cut them off at their roots with a scalpel.  Then apply powdered antimony to the area.
If bleeding occurs, cauterize it with a gentle lentil-shaped cautery iron.  Cauterization is better after the cutting, as it frequently returns if any part of the roots remains.  If cauterized with fire, the roots are burned and it will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of colds affecting the eyelids.
A condition resembling a cold in its severity and hardness often appears on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called a cold, which is the gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.  If the cold is protruding on the surface of the eyelid and moves in every direction, the treatment is simple; make a lengthwise incision across it.
Then gently remove it from all sides until it is separated.  Then suspend it with forceps and cut it, and if you cannot cut it without penetrating the eyelid, this will not harm the patient.  If the incision is large, stitch it up and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it, as the ointment will mend and knit it together.  If the cold is inclined towards the inner surface of the eyelid, turn the eyelid inside out, and suspend the cold with forceps without needing to make an incision, and remove it from all sides.
If it penetrates the eyelid with the incision, this will not harm it.  Then wash the eye with salt water after cutting the cold, and treat the area with something that will knit it together until the patient heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of the sty that appears in the eyelid.
A sty is a swelling that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it most often appears in children. It weighs down their eyes, and they experience colds in the early morning hours, and they are unable to look at sunlight. Because tears rush to them.
Therefore, you see them leaning on their faces constantly and sleeping on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, possibly swollen. The sty is clearly visible. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the sty between them. The procedure is that the patient should place his head on your lap.
Then, take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick, encompassing the sty on all sides. Then place it on the sty and press with your fingers on all sides to gather the sty in the middle of the circle.
Then, with the lancet, slit the middle of that moisture, creating a slit across it.  The slit should not be larger than a phlebotomy incision.  As for depth, you should cut all the skin until you reach the sty.
In most cases, the sty will emerge from the slit as a white piece of fat.  Pull it outward with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, moving your hand back and forth until it heals. Be careful not to enlarge the slit, lest the lancet injure the eye.
If the sty does not appear when you first slit it, gently increase the slit slightly until the sty emerges. Then pull it out as we described.  Then, dip a cloth in vinegar and water, place it on the area and secure it with a bandage. Some people crush salt.
Place it in the wound to dissolve any remaining moisture.  Then treat it until it heals.  If a hot inflammation develops at the site, treat it with cooling compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of eye dressings.
If superfluous eyelashes grow on the eyelid, exceeding the natural course and emerging under the normal lashes, they harm the eye and cause various ailments, such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, and opacity and thickness, to the point that this can cause blindness.
Eye dressings are of four types: either by cauterization with fire, or by a sharp medicine, as previously described in the chapter on cauterization; or the dressing may involve cutting and stitching, or using a splint, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it turns, then proceed, otherwise, insert a needle with a thread from beneath the eyelid and pierce the needle with the thread from above, near the hair itself. Pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
Turn it with a rod, then cut the inner surface of the eyelid, away from the excess hair, with a lancet, from the larger to the smaller incision, then pull out the thread and place a small cotton or cloth pad beneath the eyelid, and then attach the eyelid with a bandage.
The shape should resemble a basil leaf, but the shape must be tailored to how much you want to lift the eyelid, because this may vary between individuals. Some require a certain amount of the eyelid to be cut, proportionate to how much the eyelid has relaxed.
Some require a smaller cut, all of this depending on the relaxation of the eyelid. Then, using a lancet, make incisions along the lines you marked, beginning from the larger to the smaller incision. Each incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a rod.
Then, insert a hook into one corner of the skin, then peel it all off.  Then, use stitches with a needle and fine wool thread to bring the two edges together. Wipe away the blood, and attach any remaining threads to the eyebrows with a sticky substance.
You may wish to do this, or not bother.  The stitches and thread remain for about three or four days, then treat it.  If you wish, you can leave the wound un-stitched and treat it with something that dries and contracts it.  The eyelid will lift when the wound is closed and brought together; however, stitching is better.
This method of lifting the eyelid, described by the ancients, is laborious for the patient, yet a good method with no danger.  Another method of lifting the eyelid is to shape it like a basil leaf, as we described. Then, lift the eyelid with three hooks, which may be separate or grouped in this way:.
Then, cut away any excess eyelid with a small pair of scissors, in this way, cutting evenly.
If you cannot hold the hooks in place and the shape is not right, take a needle with thread, insert it into the center of the shape, insert another thread near the larger incision, and a third near the smaller incision.  Hold the threads evenly between your fingers, then lift your hand steadily with them.
Raise the entire marked skin as we described, then stitch the edges of the wound together and treat it until healed.  If a hot swelling appears after your cutting or incision, relieve the swelling with opobalsamum or similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also turn inside out.  In this case, use the cutting, stitching, and cauterization with fire or sharp medicine described earlier. Cauterization with fire or sharp medicine is less severe on the patient than cutting and stitching; cutting and stitching are more involved in these instances.
Cauterization with reeds is performed as follows: turn the eyelid inside out, and make the incision from the inside as described; then make two thin reeds or sticks, their length equal to the eyelid's length, and their width less than the scalpel's width.
Nibble at the ends of each of the two sides where the threads attach, then gently bring them together on the remaining eyelid and firmly pull the reeds from both sides. Leave it for several days; the stretched skin will die, turn black, and fester.
Until it falls off by itself.  If it is slow to fall off, nibble it away with pliers, then treat it until healed.  When it has healed, the eyelid will rise and the eyelashes will not prick the eye.  This is the shape of the two reeds, made with the exact length and width shown here.
Chapter Twelve.
For removing irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
If a hair or two are irritating, take a thin needle, thread it with a smooth, thin silk thread, tie the ends in a very delicate knot, and make the thread approximately a span long.
Then, thread another thin thread of shorter length into a tweezers, and tie its ends if desired.  Have the patient place their head on your lap, near the light to see the work clearly.  This is precise work.  Then, use the needle and tweezers to grasp the base of the extra hair.
And carefully pull it out through the eyelid, above the natural hair, then pull the thread upwards out of the tweezers and remove the hair(s) (one, two, or three, but no more) from the tweezers.
Then pull the tweezers outward, so that the hair is extracted from the eyelid along with the natural hair. If the tweezers are pulled but the hair does not come out with them, pull the tweezers downwards using the thread you have attached, to remove the tweezers from the upper opening.
Then, reinsert the hair into the tweezers and pull them out. Repeat this until the hair is pulled up through the opening, and you can see it clearly. At that point, release the tweezers and thread, remove them, and bandage the eye. Leave the bandage on for two or three days, until the hair is securely in place and the flesh grows around it.
If the hair is short, either add a longer piece of natural hair to it so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a while, and then lift it out.
Chapter Thirteen.
On treating the stye that occurs in the upper eyelid.
This stye, which is called "arniyyah," may be either natural or accidental.  An accidental stye results from an abscess, wound, cut, or burn.
The procedure is to cut open the abscess, separate its edges, and place a linen thread between them and tie it, until it heals.  One should not use things that dry and constrict in treating it.
If you do that, the stye will return worse. Instead, use things that soften it, such as fenugreek, a decoction of thyme root, linseed, and diachylon ointment mixed with some oils.  Apply this mixture to the thread and treat with it.
The aim of treatment is to prevent it from adhering to its original state in every way possible.  This method we have described is only part of the treatment for the stye, and it does not restore the area to its original form.
Fourteenth Chapter.
On treating the stye that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This stye, which occurs from below, is the true stye and is natural.  The accidental styes result from wounds, cuts, burns, and the like.
The method is to take a needle with a doubled thread, pierce the flesh, passing it from the inner to the outer canthus until the thread is on both sides of the flesh.  Then, pull the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good.  Otherwise, take a thread and place it on the site of the cut, then turn the eyelid, cutting two incisions on the inside of the eyelid, making the ends of the incisions meet at the angle of the previous cut. So that when they meet, the shape will resemble this form.
Then, remove the flesh so that the sharp side is below the eyelid, and gather the separated pieces with two stitches using a wool thread. Then treat with the relaxing and drawing remedies mentioned previously until healed.
If the scar resulted from a cut, stitch, or cauterization, a small incision should be made, also without affecting the eyelashes, as previously described.  Then separate the lips with a thread, as mentioned before.
In short, for treating a scar, whether above or below, perform the procedure according to the scar's appearance.  For scars vary greatly in appearance, and the skilled surgeon devises the best possible method.
Until the shape returns to or nearly resembles its natural form; the nature of the illness itself indicates the appropriate procedure and instruments in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion can affect many people, causing the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, preventing its free movement and hindering its natural functions.  Therefore, a slender instrument should be inserted beneath the eyelid.
And lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not as sharp as other scalpels, but rather somewhat blunt, so that the patient is not distressed during the procedure and the scalpel does not slip, hurting the eye with its sharpness.  Your incision should be like peeling away the adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its normal position and the entire adhesion heals.  Then, instill a saline solution into the eye to wash it, or drop a solution of zinjari (possibly a type of mineral) in water from a dropper onto the eye.  Then separate the eyelid and eye with a linen thread.
And place moistened egg white on top of the eye. After three days, use softened dressings until healed.
Chapter Sixteen.
In the cutting of the nail and deep flesh growths.
The nail is of two types: either nervous, resembling a tough, thin membrane, or non-nervous, resembling a stiff, white moisture; if touched with iron or attempted to be grasped with a hook, it will break.
No hook will hold it. Both types begin from the larger root and slowly spread to cover the eye and block light and eye movement. The procedure for cutting it involves the patient placing their head on your knee.
Then, open their eyes and raise the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail with a slightly bent hook and pull it upwards.  Then take a needle, thread it with a horse or ox hair and strong thread, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and pierce the center of the nail.
Pierce it with the needle, tie the nail with the thread, pull it upwards, and remove the side of the nail next to the pupil with the hair, as if spreading it with the hair to its end.  Then cut the rest at the root of the nail with a gentle scalpel or small scissors, leaving the natural nail bed flesh.
So that a constant flow of tears will not result from its cutting.  The nail may be pulled out with the hook alone, or with the thread, as we have said, then the smooth side, which is depicted in this image, is removed with the scalpel.
And be careful not to touch the cornea with the scalpel, causing a rupture and damaging the pupil.  Then, after the cut, apply some powdered salt or a zinc-based preparation to the eye. Leave it for another day, then treat it appropriately until it heals.
If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle or secure a hook, this type of nail is often treated with medication and heals as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, blunt scalpel, like this image. Carefully scrape the nail from above with it, gently.  If you see that it is crumbling and only the scraping is affecting it, apply some zinc-based preparation, or red preparation, or powdered salt to the eye from your container.  Apply pressure to the eye until the next day.
Then, continue the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot abscess appears in the eye. Leave it alone, treat the abscess until it heals, then resume scraping until it heals.  And for the protruding flesh of the eye...
If the protrusion is causing the eye significant pain, attach the protrusion with a hook and cut away some of it, but do not cut excessively to avoid tearing the eye. Then apply red or zinc-based preparation to the depth until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting the protruding growths and excess flesh in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red, layered flesh may grow, completely covering the pupil, almost completely covering or overflowing onto the eyelids, and possibly causing the eyelids to turn outward, resembling a rose.
The procedure is for the patient to place their head on your lap, then open their eyes, and to pick out all the red flesh with the appropriate hooks.
Or to grasp it with a scalpel or a forceps, and then to cut the flesh piece by piece until all of it is removed, safeguarding the eye so as not to injure it during the procedure.  Your cutting can be done using the scalpel that we described in the cutting of the toenail, or with small scissors. Like the ones used to pick out thorns, as their image will appear in the following chapter.
Once the cutting is complete and all the flesh is gone, fill the eye with ground salt or drop in red, or similar, corrosive medicines.  Apply a white of egg poultice externally to the eye to relieve any burning inflammation.
If any flesh remains and bleeding occurs, and you fear a burning inflammation, leave the eye alone and treat it with something that relieves the swelling, then return to the procedure until it heals.  Likewise, treat any excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye, either by nature or by appearance, through surgical procedure with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the organ is able to tolerate such an operation.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the extraction of objects from the eye.
The threads are red veins that intertwine on the eye, preventing sight and weakening the eye over time.  Therefore, you should first look to see if the eye containing the threads is strong and has no other ailment besides the threads.
Then, the extraction is done by instructing the patient to place their head on your lap.  Then, grasp those veins with one or two delicate hooks, shaped like this:
Or, two hooks may be joined together as one, like this:
Then, gently extract those veins with a fine pair of scissors.  Wipe away the blood periodically until you see the eye is free of those veins and the blood has ceased.  Be careful not to injure the eye with the scissors' edges.  Work during the middle of the day in the sun's light.
Be very diligent in your work, so as not to cut anything besides the veins.  When you are finished, apply green or red henna to the eye, so that its sharpness will consume what remains of the threads.  If you cannot extract all of it at that time, bandage the eye to relieve any pain.
Leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and the inflammation is gone. Then repeat the procedure exactly as described until it is healed. This is the method for extracting the veins without harming the eye.
Leave it [with the patient's head resting on the student's lap, and another student wiping away tears and examining the front and back of the eye].  The essential part of the procedure is to open the eye with fixed or triangular openers held by a student.
Observe carefully, and the patient's head should rest on the student's lap.  Another student should wipe away the tears and examine the front and back of the eye.  You have the choice of starting the extraction from the top or bottom of the eye.  The preferable method is to first wipe away two spots on the upper side; one at the end of the eyebrow and the other at the beginning.
Hold it between the middle and index fingers.  Then, place hooks beneath them.  Then, hold it between the ring and pinky fingers.  Gently remove your hand so that you see all the threads have risen.  Cut them, if you wish, with small scissors, or with a gentle scalpel.
Thread a needle with the instrument, and carefully separate all the threads until they rise above the conjunctiva.  Do not cut the threads too harshly, for tears and blood will mix with the substance (become liquid) on you.
Then, cut with scissors any excess thread above and below the eyebrow, so that only the thread on the cornea remains exposed. If possible, lift the threads from the cornea with the instrument; this is better, and it may be possible for some individuals.
If you cut it, the wound will be sore for several days.  It will reduce the pain and swelling.  Then repeat the procedure.
Chapter Nineteen.
In returning the quill to the nose.
Doctors call the quill a polypus if, after treating it with cauterization or a sharp burning medicine, as previously described, it does not heal.  Then the only remedy is to incise the tumor when it is ripe and remove all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, remove it with a tool of this shape:
The scraper-head, made of Indian iron, is round like a button.  It is engraved with fine grooves like a file or a scraper.  Place it on the corrupted area of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while slightly clenching your hand until you are certain that the corruption has been removed.
And do this several times. Then bind the area with desiccated, astringent medicines.  If the area is sealed, flesh grows there, the flow of the illness stops, and forty days pass without recurrence, discharge, or any other incident.
Know then that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no other remedy except to return the polypus to the nasal cavity in this manner: expose the bone again with iron or a sharp medicine.  Once the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The tip of the iron should be triangular and its shaft tapered to a point, as you see.  Then place it on the bone itself, near the nasal opening, keeping your hand a little away from the eye.  Then rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
If he feels air escaping from it when he holds his hand over his nose, then bind the area with desiccated, astringent medicines, as I have taught you.  When flesh grows and the area hardens, the material that was protruding outward returns to the nose, making it easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On the repositioning of the eye protrusion.
If the entire eye has protruded and there is no impairment or loss of vision, the patient should be made comfortable, then be restrained in a cradle, then a compress should be placed on the back of the neck, without any specific condition, and gently suctioned.
Then apply a compress made of acacia, licorice root, frankincense, and henna to the eye.  The eye should then be tightly bound over the dressing with many bandages.  The bandages should be made by taking many soft strips of cloth and folding each into four layers, and making many of these.
Then place them one over another as needed for the eye, then tightly bind them with a strong cloth, and reapply the compress by suctioning, without any specific condition. Then remove the compress and leave the eye bound for a day and a night.
If the ligament relaxes during this time, it should be tightened again. Then remove the bandage after one day and one night, as we said. If you see the eye has returned, then that's good. Otherwise, repeat the dressing, bandages, tightening, and compress until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On the cutting of the conjunctiva.
If a rupture occurs in the conjunctiva, then it protrudes and appears outside the eyelids like a conjunctiva, disfiguring the person's appearance, and you wish to cut it, then the procedure is as described.
Insert a needle into the base of the conjunctiva from below to above. Then, insert another needle carrying a doubled thread from the [medial] side and pass it through [the conjunctiva]. Leave the first needle in place.
Then, cut the point where the doubled thread bends and tie some of the conjunctiva around the needle and tighten it firmly.  Then, remove the needle and apply wool soaked in egg white to the eye.  Leave it until the threads fall away with the conjunctiva.  Then treat the eye with a strengthening remedy.
Until the wound heals.  The conjunctiva may be tightened from all sides with a circular bandage, so that the eye protrudes more firmly.  Then, apply a thin scalpel to the recessed part of the eye, so that the white moisture drains and the eye descends, wilting in its position.  Then, tighten it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
Concerning the treatment of the abscess.
This affliction, called the abscess, is a collection in the eye resembling descending water but without it.  The method of treatment is that the patient sits upright on a chair, and then you take their head in your hands from both sides.
Move it, so that you see the collection descend before your eyes, then stop and don't move it.  Light will be released, and the patient will see objects as they used to. If it doesn't descend, we know it is water. If the collection does not descend as described.
Otherwise, seat the patient before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision on the cornea, near where the abscess meets the cornea in the limbus, until the material is expelled.
If it is expelled, instill warm water into the eye, with honey added, or boiled water with licorice and honey, and then treat with other remedies until healed.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have described the types of water in the classification and which are suitable for instillation, with detailed explanations.  Follow that for accuracy.  Then, the patient should sit before you, in a squat position, facing the light near the sun.
Tie and firmly hold the healthy eye, then lift the eyelid with your left hand if the affected eye is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the tip of the cup near the limbus, with the thickness of a date seed, in the white of the eye on the side of the smaller conjunctiva, and push the cup firmly, turning it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel the cup has reached an empty space.
The cup should penetrate to a depth equal to the distance from the edge of the pupil to the edge of the iris (limbus).  The brass cup will be seen by the observer within the eye, due to the clarity of the cornea. Then move the cup upwards to the location of the water.
Then press it downwards repeatedly.  If the water descends at once, the patient will see what has been revealed to his sight at once, the cup in his eye, and then rest a while.  If the water rises, lower it again without removing the cup.
If it settles and does not rise, gently remove the cup, twisting your hand a little at a time.  Then dissolve some clear, fine salt in water, wash the inside of the eye with it, and apply a moistened cloth or wool to the entire outside of the eye.
Apply rose ointment and egg white and bandage the good eye.  As for us and people of our time, we apply ground cumin with egg white. If the cup does not enter the eye due to its hardness (for some people have very hard eyes), One should take the lancet called the *bayrid*, which is depicted thus:
Pierce only the adhered tissue with it; do not go deep into the puncture.  Rather, make a gentle incision for the cup, then insert the cup as previously described.  When your work is complete, prepare a secure, lying position for the patient, with him sleeping on his back in a dark room.
He should refrain from all movement and coughing.  His food should be easily digestible, and he should not move his head to either side at all.  The bandage remains in place for three days.  Then, in that dark room, remove the bandage and test his eyesight.
Show him objects, then replace the bandage for seven days.  You should not do this during treatment or after the cup has been applied, but you should avoid doing it before the water quickly rises due to excessive staring.
If a hot swelling appears, then you should remove the eye patch before the seventh day and treat it with whatever relieves the swelling. Once the swelling subsides, then release his sight and place a veil over his face, training his vision from underneath it for several days while he remains in the dark room.
He gradually leaves the room and attends to his affairs. Know that the learner cannot dispense with observing the process multiple times before performing the procedure. I have heard from some Iraqis that they make a cupping device in Iraq that sucks out water.
I have not seen anyone in our country do this, nor have I read of it in any book by the ancients.  It may be a recent innovation.  Here are pictures of various types of cupping devices, so he can familiarize himself with them.
It is made of copper, specifically, and its tip has precisely this slender, triangular, sharp point.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Various superfluous fleshy growths may appear in the nose, some resembling scorpions with many legs, others cancerous, hard, and dark-colored, and still others soft and not dark-colored.
For those fleshy growths that are soft, not malignant or cancerous, the patient should sit facing the sun, their nostril opened, and a forceps applied to the growths.  Then, draw them out, and cut off any remaining part with a gentle, sharp scalpel on a single stroke.
Ensure all the flesh is removed. If any part remains uncut, gently scrape it away with a delicate instrument until nothing is left, lest bleeding or a hot swelling ensue.
If it is a malignant tumor, cauterize it immediately until the bleeding stops and all the flesh disappears.  Then, after the excision, apply vinegar and water or a drink to the nose.  If the nose opens and moisture runs down to the throat, it is well.
Know that it is healed if the moisture flows properly. If not, know that there is a fleshy growth within the spongy bone, unreachable by the cutting instrument.  In that case, a thick linen thread should be taken.
Tie many knots in it, spacing each knot a finger's breadth or less.  The patient should maneuver one end of the thread into the nostril with a probe or any suitable tool, fashioned like a button, and pull gently until it reaches the turbinates.
It will emerge at the throat.  Children often do this in school, and it is easy for anyone willing.  Then, gather the two ends of the thread—the one that came out of the mouth and the one that remained in the nose.
Then, use the knots in the thread to dissect the flesh, continuing until you know that the flesh has been severed by the knots of the thread.  Then remove the thread.  The nose, after cleansing the blood, should be treated with a bandage soaked in Egyptian ointment for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all remaining flesh.  Finally, a lead tube is placed in the nostril for several days until healed. If further drying is needed, use this treatment.
This is an image of the instrument used to instill ointments and medicines into the nose.
A small, open-mouthed, ointment-filled lamp-like vessel of silver or copper is placed.
If you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the instrument's applicator flat.
It has a handle at the end, as you see, to hold it when heated with ointment or whatever liquid substances you desire.
Chapter Twenty-five.
Concerning warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Warts often grow on the tip of the nose, increasing and enlarging over time until their appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance, removing it completely, and then apply either cauterization or a burning medicine that acts as a cauterant.  If it has been missed until it has grown large, examine it. If it is hard, stony, dark-colored, and insensitive, ...
Do not cut it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor. I have often seen that cutting this tumor has brought about great misfortune for the sufferer. If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and I see that it can be completely removed by cutting, ... Then remove the affected tissue and cut it without hesitation or delay. Treat the area with something that dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If its connection is separated by a wound or the like, know that if the connection of any of these cartilages is separated, rarely will treatment be effective, except in some individuals.
Therefore, if any of this occurs to someone, examine if the wound is fresh and bloody.  If so, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and then treat it until it heals.  If the separation has occurred and each side of the separation is intact, then carefully peel back each side of the separation to the extent of its visible skin until bleeding results.
Then bring the edges together with sutures, tighten them, and sprinkle powdered  cinnamon and frankincense on them.  Apply a plaster of palm tree ointment or another adhesive ointment on top of that. Leave it tight for two or three days, then remove it.
Then change the medication and leave it until the stitches come out on their own.  Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The method of suturing is to bring together the separated connection either with needles, as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread, as I explained there.
The Twenty-seventh Chapter.
On removing knots that appear in the lips.
Small, hard tumors, resembling some carbuncles and others smaller or larger, may appear inside the lips of many people.  It is necessary to turn back the lip and cut open each knot, and remove it with forceps.
Cut it from every side, then fill the area after cutting with powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt.  Treat the areas with what contracts until the wounds heal.
The Twenty-eighth Chapter.
On cutting excess flesh in the gums.
Excess flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called *abolus*.  It should be lifted with forceps or held with a scalpel and cut at its base, allowing the blood to drain, then apply powdered alum to the area.
Or one of the astringent, dried powders.  If that flesh returns after treatment, it often does; cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
The Twenty-ninth Chapter.
On scraping the teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums.  They may turn black, yellow, or green, causing decay to spread to the gums and disfigure the teeth.
The patient should be seated before you, head resting on your lap.  Clean the tooth or teeth showing scales and sand-like material until nothing remains.  Do the same for black, green, or yellow discoloration, and so on, until clean.
If the first scraping removes all the material, then it is done. Otherwise, repeat the scraping another day, and a second, and a third, until you achieve your goal.  Know that teeth require a variety of scraping tools, many shapes, according to what is needed for your task.
Because the scraper used for cleaning the inside of a tooth is different from the scraper for the outside, and the scraper for between the teeth has a different shape.  These are various types of scrapers that should all be prepared.
Chapter Thirty.
On the extraction of teeth.
One should treat the tooth's pain with every possible method, and avoid extracting it if possible.  For there is no remedy after extraction, as it is a precious substance, even if extraction becomes necessary.
If the patient is determined to have the tooth extracted, one should be certain that the tooth is properly located and the pain is well-defined. Often, the patient is deceived by the pain, believing it is in the healthy tooth and extracting it, then the pain does not cease until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have seen this happen repeatedly with the actions of the barbers.
If you are certain of the precise location of the painful tooth, then you should use a forceful scalpel to cut around the tooth, separating the gum from all sides, then move it gently with your fingers or fine forceps, little by little, until it loosens.
Then, firmly grasp the tooth with large forceps, while the patient's head is securely held between your knees.  Pull the tooth straight to avoid fracturing it.  If it does not come out, take one of those instruments and insert it beneath it from all sides gently, moving it as you did before.
If the tooth is hollow or decayed, you should fill the hole with a cloth and seal it firmly with a thin, smooth instrument so that it does not break apart when you pull on it with forceps.  You should carefully cut around the gum from all sides.
Use caution to avoid breaking the tooth, for any remaining portion will become a greater affliction for the patient than the initial pain.  Do not do as the ignorant barbers do in their haste and attempts to extract it without using the methods we have described.
Often they inflict great calamities on people, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving the roots, either all or some of them. Or, they may pull out parts of the jawbone, as we have seen repeatedly.  After extraction, the patient should rinse with a drink or vinegar and salt.  If bleeding occurs at the site, which often happens, then crush some alum and apply it to the area.
Otherwise, if alum is ineffective, use forceps.  The delicate forceps used to first move the tooth should have long tips and short handles, thick enough not to bend when gripping the tooth.  Here is a picture of the larger forceps.
They should be, as you see, thick in the handles, so that when grasped, they do not yield or bend; short in the tips.  They should be made of Indian iron or tempered steel, with firmly joined tips, and teeth on the tip that fit together, to grip tightly.
The tips can also be shaped like a file, making them very strong and precise.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On extracting the roots of teeth and removing fractured jawbones.
If, in extracting a tooth, a root has broken off, you should place a piece of cotton soaked in oil on the area for a day or two, to allow the area to relax. Then you should use a forceps or pliers. Which resemble the beak of a bird called a *balrajah*, and this is an illustration of the pliers.
If it is made like a file from the inside or like a scraper, then if these pliers do not cause it to come out, you should drill into the root, and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert the instrument, which resembles a small lever, which is shown here.
Short, slightly thick at the tip, and not tapered so as not to break. If the root comes out with this, then use these other instruments, whose illustration is this. The first is triangular, with some thickness.
Another delicate triangular image.
We may also use this two-pronged instrument, whose image is also this.
And with other instruments and iron tools mentioned in the description of the teeth, we may also use this instrument which resembles a large fishhook, whose image is this.
Triangular, bent at the tip, with a little thickness to avoid breakage, and not tapered. And know that dental instruments are numerous, and likewise the other instruments are almost countless, and the skillful craftsman, through his craft, may invent instruments according to what work and illnesses themselves indicate.
For there are diseases for which the ancients did not describe instruments, due to the variety of their types. If a bone of the jaw or of one of the bones of the mouth breaks or decays, search for it in its place with whatever is suitable from among these instruments and tweezers mentioned in the extraction of the roots.
And we use a forceps, whose image is this.
It should have some slight thickness to grip the bone and prevent it from slipping until the bone is extracted, and we treat the area with appropriate medicines. If the bone has a slight decay, remove its decay and blackness until it is clean, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter Thirty-two.
In the spreading of the teeth that grow over others.
Teeth that grow out of their natural course disfigure the appearance, particularly in women and slaves.  If a tooth has grown behind another tooth, one should observe.
If it cannot be spread or straightened, extract it.  If it is stuck to another tooth, cut it off with this instrument, whose image is this.
It resembles a small beak, made of very sharp Indian steel. Cut it in several days due to the tooth's hardness and so as not to loosen other teeth. If it is protruding and firmly in place, cool it with an Indian file, whose image is this.
It should be entirely of Indian steel, with very delicate engravings, like the file used to make needles.  Cool the tooth gradually over many days, gently, to avoid dislodging it and causing it to fall out. Then smooth it afterward and scrape it with some scrapers.
If a tooth has broken off, causing the tongue pain when speaking, it should also be cooled until the roughness of the break disappears, it becomes smooth, and it no longer hurts the tongue or disrupts speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In fastening loose teeth with silver or gold thread.
If old teeth become loose and shift due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot eat anything for fear of losing them, and binding medicines have not helped.
The remedy is to tie them with gold or silver thread. Gold is preferable because silver tarnishes and rots after a few days, while gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of medium thickness and thinness, appropriate for the space between the teeth.
The method of tying is to take the thread, thread its bend between the sound teeth, and then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, one or more, until the weaving reaches the sound tooth on the other side.
Then repeat the weaving from the side you began on, gently and skillfully tightening your grip so that nothing moves.  Tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth so it does not come loose.  Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, bring them together, twist them with a knife, and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
To prevent injury to the tongue.  Then leave it tied like this for as long as it remains. If it comes undone or breaks, tie it again with another thread.  He will enjoy it like this for his whole life. This is the image of the teeth and the method of tying in two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
A single or two teeth may be returned to their place after falling out, and fastened as we have described, and remain.  A skilled artisan does this.  He may carve bone from an ox, shaping it like a tooth, and place it in the position from which the tooth has gone. And ties it as we said, so it remains, and he enjoys it.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the ligament that appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament that appears under the tongue may be either natural, present from birth, or accidental, resulting from a healed wound.
The procedure is to open the patient's mouth, holding their head in your lap, and lift their tongue.  Then, cut the nerve ligament transversely so the tongue is released from its restraint. If it shows some stiffness and complexity, if it's from a healed wound, then insert a small hook and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots are loosened.
Beware that the cut does not penetrate deeply into the flesh and sever an artery, causing bleeding.  Then, rinse the area after the cut with rose water or vinegar and cold water.  Place a linen wick under the tongue for the patient to hold each night.
To prevent re-adhesion. If bleeding occurs, apply powdered zea to the area. If the bleeding is excessive, cauterize the area with a suitable, lens-shaped cautery. Then treat it with further remedies until healed.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On removing a toad that has developed under the tongue.
A swelling resembling a small toad may develop under the tongue, hindering the tongue's normal function, and possibly enlarging to fill the mouth.  The procedure is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the swelling.
If it appears dark-colored or black and hard, causing no sensation to the patient, do not attempt to treat it, for it is cancer. If it is whitish with moisture, then use a forceps to open it, and dissect it gently with a sharp scalpel, removing it from all sides.
If bleeding occurs during the procedure, apply powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then resume the procedure until the swelling is completely removed.  Then, the patient should rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with whatever further treatment is appropriate until healed.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On the treatment of tonsil tumors.
Any tumors that grow in the throat may present glands inside the throat resembling those that appear outside, called tonsils. If these are treated as described in the division but do not heal.
If the tumor is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive, do not use the iron on it.  If it is red and thick, do not use iron either, for fear of bloodletting. Instead, let it mature, either by applying a poultice or until it bursts on its own.
If it is white, round, and its origin thin, this is what should be cut. Before doing so, observe if the hot swelling has subsided completely or if some of the swelling has decreased.
Then, have the patient sit facing the sun, head in your lap, mouth open.  Take an assistant, and have them press the tongue downwards with an instrument, which looks like this:
Made of silver or copper, it is as thin as a knife. When the tongue is pressed down and you can clearly see the tumor, take a hook, and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it outward as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes along with it.
Then, cut it with an instrument, which resembles scissors, but its ends are curved, with each of their ends sharply pointed.  It is made from Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this instrument is unavailable, then cut it with a scalpel, which looks like this:
Sharp on one side, blunt on the other.  After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner. Then, after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate rind or mugwort leaves, or similar astringents, have been boiled until the bleeding stops. Then treat it until it heals.  Other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils, and these are cut in the same way as the tonsils.
I treated a woman for a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a small, somewhat insensitive swelling.  It had nearly blocked her throat, and she was breathing through a narrow passageway. It had prevented her from eating and drinking.
She had been close to death if she had lived another day or two. Two branches had grown from the tumor and protruded from her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserting a hook into one and pulling it out, and a piece suitable for removal was extracted.
Then I cut it where it emerged from the nostril.  I did the same with the other nostril.  Then, I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut off a piece of it.  Only a small amount of blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened up, and she immediately drank water and then ate. We continued to cut away from that tumor repeatedly over a long period, and it kept regrowing after each removal.  This went on for a long time, affecting both of us.
I devised a method of cauterizing the tumor within her throat, which stopped its growth. Then I left the area, and I do not know what happened to her after I departed.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
In the excision of a tumor of the larynx.
If a tumor, known as a "bunch" [or "cluster" or "grape"], descends to the larynx and swells, it is called a "column" if it is white and oblong, and a "bunch" if it is thick at the bottom and rounded.  If treated as described in the division, and the treatment does not succeed, ...
If the inflammatory tumor has subsided and is thin, it should be excised.  However, if the tumor is a compact, rounded mass without length and is reddish, or dark-colored, or black, or without sensation, it should not be excised.
For in this condition there is risk to the patient. Therefore, if you see it with the characteristics I mentioned – its whiteness and length – the patient should sit facing the sun, and the tongue should be pressed down with the instrument described earlier, and then the snare should be inserted into the bunch.
Pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments that I described for the removal of tonsils. Only the portion exceeding the natural size should be excised; for if more is removed, it will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after excision, use the treatment described for the removal of the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is reluctant to have it excised, you should use cauterization without fear or caution. The method of cauterization is with a sharp medicament, placing the patient's head on your lap.
Then, press down the tongue with the instrument we mentioned, take the sharp water described in the chapter on cauterization, mix it with quicklime that is not extinguished, form a paste that is neither thick nor thin, fill the concavity of this instrument, which has this form:
The end of the instrument where you place the medicament should have a concavity like the bowl of a spoon. Place the instrument with the medicament on the uvula itself, with the patient lying on their side, so that saliva flows from their mouth from inside their throat, so nothing goes down to their throat and causes harm.
Then, hold the instrument with the medicament and press it against the uvula for about half an hour, until you see it blackened and the burning from the medicament has subsided.  If you wish, you can take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the cotton in the medicament.
Insert the spoon with the cotton into the tube from above so that the cotton adheres to the uvula.  Do this repeatedly until you have achieved the desired cauterization of the uvula.  Then leave it; it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to re-apply the medicament, do so.
After the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in clarified butter, removing any remaining medicament. Then, have them rinse their mouth with cold water, and treat externally with lotions and internally with gargles until healed. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and avoids fear.
The uvula can also be treated with something milder than cauterization or cutting.  Treatment with incense is done in this way:  Take frankincense, saffron, sage, fumitory, wormwood, chamomile, and other herbs, gather them all or some of them in a pot, and soak them in vinegar.
Bring it to a boil while the pot is covered with clay of wisdom.  A hole is made in the center of the cover through which the hollow instrument is fitted, made of silver or copper.
Insert the end with the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube.  Cauterize the uvula repeatedly until it withers.  Avoid using this treatment when the swelling first occurs.
For it often increases the swelling.  Instead, it should be done when the hot swelling subsides. If you don't have this instrument, take a reed and fit an egg shell to one end, so that the patient's mouth is not burned.
Because the egg shell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth.  This is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other foreign objects from the throat.
Thorns, fish bones, or other foreign objects often lodge in the throat.  It is necessary to remove any that are visible, after depressing the tongue with the instrument in the light.
To reveal what is in the throat. If something is hidden and not visible in the throat, the patient must vomit before his food is digested in his stomach.  Perhaps the object lodged will come out with the vomit, or the patient will swallow a piece of cloth or a stalk of lettuce.
Or he swallows a piece of dry bread. Or, a piece of soft sea sponge is taken, tied to a string, and swallowed. When it reaches the position of the thorn, the string is pulled quickly, repeating this several times.
Often, the thorn or bone adheres to it and comes out. If it does not come out by these methods, use a lead instrument in this manner:
It should be slightly thicker than a lead rod.  At its tip is a bend. The patient, raising their head, gently inserts it into their throat, being careful not to touch their larynx to avoid coughing, and using it to push out the bone or thorn, or the physician inserts it with his hand.
Having the patient insert it is better, as they know the location of the lodged object. They push downwards or pull upwards with the instrument, doing so as best they can until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
Removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If, having treated the leech as described in the section on medicinal treatment, it proves ineffective, then examine the patient's throat in the light of the sun after pressing their tongue with the instrument I described to you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a gentle, firm forceps.  If you cannot do this, take a hollow tube, insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, and then insert a heated, protected iron into the tube.
Do this several times. The patient should abstain from water all day.  Then, they should take a jar filled with cold water, open their mouth over it, rinse their mouth with it, but not swallow a drop.  The patient should move the water back and forth with their hand from time to time.
If the leech feels the water, it will fall off. If it does not come out with the methods described, fumigate the throat with urine and hellebore using the instrument described for inhaling fumigation.  Do this several times, and it will fall off.
The procedure for fumigation is to take a vessel containing embers heated by fire. The vessel is covered with a lid that has a hole in the middle. The instrument's tip is placed in this hole.  Then, the fumigant is placed inside, and the patient places their mouth over the end of the tube, closing their mouth so that the fumes enter their throat.
If the leech falls off at this point, good.  If it does not, the fumigation is repeated multiple times.  The patient endures thirst and eats salty foods and garlic, but does not drink water.  The leech must come out with this treatment.  This is an image of the instrument used to pull the leech from the throat once it is spotted.
It resembles tongs, as you see, except that it has this curve that enters the throat.  Its tips resemble a bird's beak, rough like a file; if it grasps something, it does not let go.
Another instrument is used to press the tongue.  It is a wide ring of iron, sized to fit the mouth over the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth upright on its side, keeping the mouth open against the patient's will.  The patient cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument that opens the mouth in this exact manner.
Chapter Forty.
It deals with the lancing and incision of tumors.
Tumors are of many diverse types, as will be described one by one in this book.  They differ in lancing and incision in two ways: one is the nature of the tumor itself and the humors it contains.
And the second type is by the locations in the body where they occur, for the tumor arising in the head is different from the tumor arising in the buttocks, and a tumor arising in fleshy tissue is different from one in a joint. Each has its own treatment.
Some tumors should not be lanced until the pus is fully matured.  Others should be lanced while still fresh and not fully matured, like tumors near the joints.
Because if a tumor near a joint grows to the point of causing gangrene around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing dysfunction of that limb, or the tumor may be near a vital organ.
Because if you delay lancing it until it ripens, you harm that vital organ, or if it is near the buttocks, lance it while fresh.  It is necessary to lance a fresh, incompletely ripened tumor near the buttocks to prevent gangrene from spreading to the inside of the buttocks and forming a fistula.
And it becomes incurable to some extent.  You should know when to lance fully ripened tumors, which is when the tumor pain subsides, the fever is gone, the redness and pulsation decrease, the head of the tumor is softened, and other symptoms improve.
The incision should be made at the lowest part of the tumor, if possible, to allow the discharge to flow downward more easily, or at the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor.  If the tumors are on the arms or legs, the incision should follow the length of the limb.
The incision should be made over the muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and in general, over all flat, non-flexing areas.  For flexing areas, the incision should follow the contour of the area.  If the tumor is in a fleshy area, it is better to leave it unlanced.
Until its ripening is complete, as we said. If you lance it before that, the discharge of pus will be prolonged, causing much harm and dirtiness, and perhaps its edges and depths will harden.  Some tumors may be lanced across the body, if necessary, or according to the needs of the limb.
Small tumors should be lanced with a single incision, while large tumors should be lanced with a wide incision or many incisions, depending on the size of the tumor.  Some tumors may require the skin to be incised and cut if it has become like a torn fabric.
The tumor has, to some extent, died, similar to what occurs in many abscesses and hidden tumors.  Some are incised with a three-sided incision, while others are incised in the shape of a rue leaf, like the tumor of the groin.
Some tumors require a circular or crescent-shaped incision, or similar incisions.  Tumors without a head, such as smooth, flat tumors, should only be lanced with a simple incision.  If the tumor is large, has accumulated for a long time, and has been lanced, one should not rush to drain all the pus at once.
Rather, drain some of it, then compress the tumor for another day, then drain some more pus.  Do this repeatedly, gradually, until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a young child, or an elderly person, the animal spirit often weakens with the sudden draining of pus.  The patient might die, and you would not be aware. Therefore, be extremely careful in this matter.
After lancing these tumors, you should clean the wound and examine it.  If the tumor wound is small or the incision is simple, use a bandage of flax or old cotton.  If the tumor is large and the incisions are numerous,
You should insert a thread into each incision until some of them connect. If the tumor has damaged or broken the skin, you should fill it with old cotton or flax lint, without moisture, and compress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.  If bleeding occurs while you are working, use cold water and vinegar, after having soaked a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding area repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the methods and treatments and cauterization techniques described in many places in this book and in the classification.  If it is winter and the tumor site has many nerves, you should soak the dressings with warm drink and warm oil.
And place it on the affected area.  If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply the dressings soaked in water and oil, or in cool drink and oil, until the third day, as we have said.  Then you should loosen the tumor and clean it.
And use similar treatments until it heals.  This is what you need to know about treating tumors in general.  As for detailed methods, each tumor is described with its specific treatment, summarized and categorized.
Chapter Forty-one.
Concerning the treatment of tumors that appear on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp, which are a type of swelling enclosed in membranes.  They have characteristics similar to a hen's egg sac, and their types are numerous.  Some are fatty, and others contain moisture resembling mud.
Some contain moisture like broth and soup, and the like.  Some are hard and stony.  All of them are without danger to incise and remove, unless an artery is encountered during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument whose image will follow, called the "midas," so that you know what they contain. If it contains moisture, incise it longitudinally with a simple incision, like this:
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~. If the moisture has drained, dissect the sac that contained the moisture and cut it entirely; do not leave any part of it, for it often recurs if any remains.
Then, dip a cotton swab in the astringent ointment, if available, or in salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it until the next day, for it will consume any remaining sac. Then, reapply the cotton swab with the astringent a second and third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that no part of the sac remains.  Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains fatty tissue, incise it like this:
Make a crosswise incision, and insert forceps into the edges of the wound. Dissect it from all sides and exert yourself to remove the peritoneum that contains it.  If an artery obstructs you, do as described previously. Similarly, if the swelling is hardened, do this from the incision.
The treatment is as described, and the incision on the hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture.  Some of these swellings in the head, in some people, have absolutely no moisture.  I incised a swelling in...
the head of an elderly woman, and found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone. It could not be broken, even if someone threw it, it would only chip.  The other swellings that occur on the head, such as those that appear on the heads of children, were different.
At the roots of the ears, make a simple incision all around.  Make a flap from the bottom so that the matter flows downwards.  Then treat it with appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-Two.
Concerning the incision on swine that frequently appear on the neck.  These swellings often appear on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin. They may appear on other parts of the body.  One may appear on the neck, or many. Some develop from others.
Each cyst has its own membrane, like the swellings and tumors of the head we have described. There are many types of these cysts, some are hard, some contain moisture, and some are malignant and unresponsive to treatment.
Of those that I saw, the ones that felt good and appeared close to the skin color, moving in all directions, were not adhered to any neck nerve, vein or artery, and were not embedded deep. It is necessary to make a simple incision from top to bottom of the body, along this line, from line ~J~ to line ~B~.
Peel it from all sides and spread the edges of the skin with a hook or two, or many if needed, as we described for tumors of the head.  Remove it little by little, taking care not to cut a nerve or artery. The scalpel should not be excessively sharp.
So that your hand does not cut too much or the patient is disturbed, cutting what is not needed. If you cut an artery or vein and this hinders your work, place powdered alum or some of the styptic agents that stop bleeding in the wound.
Tighten the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides, the wound relaxes, and it is about to fester. Then the bleeding will stop, so return to your work until it is finished. Then, with your index finger, check if there are any remaining small ones. If there are, cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the cyst, then it is not necessary to cut the cyst from its base, but rather to tie it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls out on its own without harm. Then fill the wound with used cotton, soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
If you have cut the entire cyst, you should bring the edges of the wound together and stitch it immediately, after ensuring that there is absolutely no remaining piece. If you see that a piece of the cyst remains due to its size,
Then you should aim to cut at the base and root, and use the stitching and what we have mentioned. For those cysts containing moisture, apply a simple dressing where the ripening spot appears.  Place the dressing on the lower part, as we said.
Then, after the dressing, use application of Egyptian ointment or similar to consume any remaining corruption.  Once you see the wound is clean, treat it with ointments that promote healing until it is healed.
Chapter Forty-three.
On the incision of the throat for a tumor occurring inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision of the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is in agreement with their words.  However, those with quinsy should avoid incisions of the throat, as they will not benefit from it.
For all tumors and diseases of the lung to be considered sick, and those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no problem in the trachea, then the incision of the throat must be used to escape the harm of suffocation.
Therefore, if we wish to do this, we should incise the throat below three circles of the trachea, or four small transverse incisions between two circles, to the same extent as an incision in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This location is appropriate for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant, if the surgeon is cowardly, then he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook, then cut the skin until, when he reaches the trachea, he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the peritoneum that we described, and ascertain the incision of the trachea from the phlegm that comes out of it along with what is punctured, and from the cessation of sound. He should leave the wound open for a time. When the period of fear of suffocation is over, he should bring together the edges of the wound from the skin.
And its incision is alone, without the cartilage. Then the medicines that promote flesh growth are used until it heals. Said the author of this book: The interpretation of this statement that we have related is that if they see the patient's throat blocked by one of these tumors that we mentioned.
And when the patient was close to death and despaired of life, they went to cut the throat so that the patient might breathe through the wound site and be saved from death.  But they were instructed to leave the wound open until the course of the disease was completed, and the course is typically three days or similar.
At that point, they instructed them to stitch the wound and treat it until it healed.  What I witnessed myself was that a servant took a knife and stabbed her throat, cutting part of her lung's trachea.  I was called to treat her. I found her weakening like a slaughtered animal, so I examined the wound.
I found little blood coming from the wound, and thus I was certain that she had not severed a vein or artery.  Air was escaping from the wound.  I quickly stitched and treated the wound until it healed. The servant suffered nothing, except for a hoarse voice.
And after a few days, she returned to her best condition.  Therefore, we say that cutting the throat poses no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the incision of the tumor appearing on the larynx from the outside, called the laryngeal tumor.
This tumor, called a laryngeal tumor, is a large tumor the color of the body, common in women, and of two types.
Either it is natural or accidental; the natural one has no remedy, while the accidental one is of two kinds: one resembling fatty tumors, and the other resembling a tumor arising from arterial occlusion; cutting it is dangerous. Therefore, one should not use the knife at all, unless it is small; if you probe and examine it with a probe and find it resembles a fatty tumor and is not connected to any blood vessels, cut it as you would cut a tumor. And remove it with the sac it is contained in, if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove it completely, and then treat the area with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter forty-five.
On cutting various tumors.
Tumors are of many types, and all their types were mentioned in the classification. Here, it is necessary to explain the difference between a tumor and an abscess, as this is problematic. I say that an abscess is accompanied by fever, heat, and terrifying pains until the boiling of the abscess subsides. And when the pus is complete, the fever and severity subside.  A tumor is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain.  It is contained within a sac-like covering, specific to it, and is the same color as the surrounding body.  Its initial appearance is like a boil, and it grows to be like a fig and larger or smaller.
Tumors are of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture.  The colors of moisture are numerous, as mentioned in the classification.  Therefore, when treating a tumor, one should first probe and examine it using the instrument called the 'medas', as its image will appear in the following chapter.
Assess the size of the tumor, then withdraw the probe and observe what comes out afterward. If a flowing moisture of any color comes out, make a small incision, as described in other tumors. If no moisture comes out after probing, know that it is fatty.
Incise it with a sharp incision in this manner, as I have instructed you, and suspend it with hooks. Carefully dissect the skin from every side. If possible, remove the sac containing the tumor intact.
If the sac ruptures during the procedure and you cannot remove it intact, which often happens, remove it in pieces, until nothing remains.  If any part remains, however small, the tumor will likely return.
If you are unsuccessful and a small portion remains, cauterize the wound thoroughly with sharp cautery irons.  Afterward, compress the wound and apply something to relieve the hot tumor. Treat it with other appropriate remedies until it heals. If the tumor is large, suture the edges and treat it with a healing agent.
If a bleeding vein, whether pulsating or not, obstructs you, immediately apply powdered alum to the affected area. Leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound suppurates and the blood flow subsides. Then proceed to remove any remaining part of the tumor.
Chapter Forty-six.
On the types of instruments.
The various types of instruments used in incision and excision, including probes, come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
Made of tempered steel, with square ends, to facilitate easy entry into tumors. These are the types of probes, also called "bards," and come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
It is suitable for exploring tumors, wounds, sinuses, and cavities for the bones and other contents within.  It is made round, polished, and smooth like a whetstone, from Chinese brass, or from bronze, or from copper, or from iron, or from silver; and the best is that made from bronze.
Probes may also be made of black lead, suitable for probing sinuses that have a winding path, as it will bend easily with the winding.  These are also three types: long, medium, and short.
To the extent required by the depth of each sinus, and make their thickness commensurate with the width or narrowness of the sinus.  Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks, which are numerous types: some are simple, meaning those with one hook, and these are three types: large, medium, and small; then there are blind hooks, which are three types; and then there are hooks with two hooks, which are three types; and then there are curved hooks with two hooks. And there are three types; and among them are hooks with three hooks, which are three types.  All of these types require their specific location.  Image of a large simple fishing rod. Image of a medium-sized simple fishing rod. Image of a small simple fishing rod.
Image of a large blind fishing hook. Image of a medium-sized blind fishing hook.
Image of a small blind fishing hook.
Image of a large fishing hook with two barbs. Image of a medium-sized fishing hook with two barbs. Image of a small fishing hook with two barbs.
Image of a large fishing hook with three barbs.
Image of a medium-sized fishing hook with three barbs. Image of a small fishing hook with three barbs.
And these are the images of the scalpels with which goods and tumors are cut and scraped, and they are three types, because some are large, some are medium, and some are small. Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium-sized scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its cutting edges, which are used for cutting, are limited, and the other ends are not limited, but they were made like this so that they can be used to scrape the tissue when there is a fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may be comforted and find some relief from the burning sensation experienced when the tumor is scraped.
And these are the images of the retractors, and they are three types, because some are large, some are medium, and some are small.  Image of a large retractor.
It is made of polished brass, the kind used for eye treatment, and on one end is a wide, spoon-like object of two layers.  Within its head, a scalpel blade is hidden, resembling a bird's tongue, which moves in and out as desired, as you see.
Images of the scalpels that are held between the fingers when removing tumors, so the patient does not feel them.  They are three types, some large, some medium, and some small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Images of the cupping vessels used to cut off blood flow.  There are three types, some large, some medium, and some small.  Image of the large cupping vessel.
Made of copper or bronze, slightly elongated and rounded, as you see.  They must be thin.  You should have these types of cupping vessels, large and small, to cut off blood quickly when necessary and when medicine is unavailable.
But they are not used to cut blood in every part of the body.  They are used in fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, abdomen, groin, and similar moist, fleshy organs.
Other small instruments may be made from it, resembling pistachio shells, in this manner.
Blood is cut with them if it flows from the vein-cutting site or when a vein or artery is cut.  A rounded one may be made in this fashion.
Chapter Forty-seven.
In the treatment of the male breast.
The breast of some people, resembling that of women, may swell at the age of puberty, becoming swollen and unsightly. Whoever dislikes this should have the breast incised with a crescent-shaped incision, like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with the medicated ointment, then bring the edges of the wound together with stitches, and treat it until it heals.  If the breast sags and loosens from its bone, as happens with women.
Then an incision should be made on its upper sides, with two incisions resembling a crescent shape, each connecting to the other at their ends, so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one in this way. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then the skin between the incisions is peeled away, the fat removed, and the aforementioned sutures and cauterization, and any necessary treatment, are used until it heals.
If the incision does not encompass all that should be cut because of the patient's anxiety or bleeding, then the wound should be packed with cotton dipped in the corrosive ointment and left until it consumes the remaining fat, and then treated until healed.
Chapter Forty-eight.
On the treatment of tumors appearing under the armpit.
These tumors appearing under the armpit are of the pig-like, hard, sac-containing type; some contain moisture.  Those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, like this.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~.  If all the moisture in the tumor has been drained, pack it with used cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat with the appropriate ointment until healed. If the tumor is of the pig-like lump type, incise it as we described in the incision for pig-like tumors. If the wound becomes suppurative, apply cauterization as previously mentioned.
Chapter Forty-nine.
Incising the tumor that appears near the artery or vein, called an aneurism.
If an artery is wounded and the skin above it is adhered, a tumor often appears.  Similarly, a vein may also develop a swelling and tumor.
The signs by which one can know if the swelling and puffiness are from an artery or a vein are:  If it's from an artery, the swelling is oblong, situated deep within the body, and when you press it with your finger, you feel a crackling sensation.
And that which is from the vein is a round swelling on the surface of the body.  Incising these tumors is dangerous, especially in the armpit, groin, neck, and many other parts of the body, and if they are very large, one should avoid treating them with iron.
Also, those in the extremities or head should be avoided.  For those that are swellings of the artery's mouth, make a longitudinal incision in the skin, then open the incision with forceps, then dissect and free the artery from its sheaths.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I instructed you in tying the arteries of the temples, then pierce with a lancet the area between the ligaments until all the blood therein is expelled.
The swelling will resolve, and then use the treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall away, then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from a vein rupture, you should grasp as much of the swelling with the skin as possible, then insert a needle below the area you grasped, and pass it through, with a double thread, until it comes out from the other side. Then tie the swelling firmly, as I described to you in tying the veins on both sides with the ends of the thread.  If you fear the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling at the point where the first needle crosses.
Tie your threads in four places, then slit the swelling in the middle until whatever is inside is expelled. Cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied. Then place a dressing on it that has been soaked in a potion and oil. Then use the treatment that involves twisting and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
In the swelling caused by nerve twisting.
Just as swelling occurs in the artery and vein, swelling also occurs in the nerve if a blow is inflicted or if excessive fatigue or the like happens. This is more common in the wrists and ankles.
And in every place where joints move, it is a hard swelling similar in color to the rest of the body.  Most often it is painless, but if pressed forcefully, the patient feels a sensation like numbness.  The swelling is not concentrated deep within the body.
Rather, it is beneath the skin and moves in every direction, not forward or backward.  If it is in the joints, it should not be treated with iron, as it may cause a wound.  What is in the head or forehead...
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the swelling is small, grasp it with a dissector and cut it from the root. If it is large, suspend it with a hook, and peel it away, then remove it. Close the wound with stitches and treat it until healed.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On the excision of warts appearing on the abdomen.
Warts, called fungous because of their resemblance to mushrooms, frequently appear on the abdomens and other parts of the body of some people.  Their base is thin, and their head is thick. Sometimes their lips have fused, and they vary in size, some being very large.
I observed a man with two warts on his abdomen, resembling mushrooms in appearance.  Their thin, whitish bases had fused, and their lips were cracked.  Moisture constantly dripped from them.  I cut them away.  One weighed approximately eighteen ounces, and the other about six ounces.
When cutting them, observe.  If the growth is moist, the wart is white, moist, and thin-based, then cut it with a broad scalpel.  Have a cautery iron heated nearby, as significant bleeding frequently occurs during excision.
If profuse bleeding occurs, cauterize it immediately.  If the growth is tender and recoils from being cut with a tool, take a tightly wound lead thread and bind it to the wart of this description.  Leave it for two days, then gradually tighten the lead.
As the lead tightens on the wart, it will eventually detach and fall off on its own, without further intervention.  If the wart has a thick base, cutting it presents some danger and uncertainty, especially when located on the abdomen.  However, it may be possible to remove half or part of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat the wound until it heals.  Beware of cutting a wart that is dark-colored, insensitive, and discolored, for it is a cancerous tumor. We will discuss cancer after this.

In treating umbilical protrusions.
Umbilical protrusions arise from various causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum on the abdomen, causing the bowel or omentum to protrude, as seen in other hernias; or from blood emanating from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from accumulated gas.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of the omentum, the tumor will have a color similar to the body, be soft without pain, and appear with various shapes. If it is due to the bowel protruding, its appearance will differ more significantly from the description given.  If you press it with your fingers, it disappears then returns, and there may be rumbling sounds; it will enlarge considerably during a bath or heavy exertion. If caused by moisture, it will be soft.
If it does not disappear when pressed by hand and does not increase or decrease in size, it is likely due to blood.  In this case, the tumor will show a dark discoloration. If it is due to a growing piece of flesh, the tumor will be firm, solid, and of consistent size.
If it is due to gas, its touch will be soft. The procedure in such cases is to observe carefully. If the umbilical protrusion is caused by arterial or venous blood, or gas, one should refrain from treatment, as there is danger and deception involved, as I have informed you in the section where I discussed tumors arising from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to the intestines or omentum, instruct the patient to hold themselves still and stand upright, fully extended.  Then, make markings around the entire navel. Then, instruct them to lie on their back before you.  Cut around the navel using a wide scalpel, along the marked area.  Then, pull the center of the tumor upward with a large forceps. Finally, tie the incision with strong thread or silk thread securely.
The knot of the bandage should be a figure-of-eight.  Then, open the center of the tightened tumor above the bandage, and insert your index finger.  If you find the intestines have been grasped by the bandage, loosen the figure-of-eight knot and push the intestines back into the abdomen. If you find omentum, stretch it using forceps.
And cut off the excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, tie it off firmly.  Return to your task, and take two needles.  Thread strong threads through them.  Insert the two needles into the incision you made around the tumor, piercing it firmly.  Then, tighten the tumor at four points on the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the tightened flesh decays and falls off on its own, or cut it if it becomes thin and decayed.  Then, treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical protrusion is from flesh that has grown there.
Or if it is from moisture, you should cauterize the tumor as we have said, and remove the blood or moisture you find there.  Then treat it with whatever will heal the area.
The fifty-third chapter.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines, and cautioned against treating it with iron to avoid ulceration.  We have also mentioned cancer originating in the uterus and cautioned against its treatment.
The ancients stated that when the cancer is in a location where it can be completely excised, like cancer in the breast or the thigh, and similar excisable organs, especially if it is small and early, one should remove it completely.  However, if it is advanced and large, it should not be approached.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve this.  If the cancer is, as we said, widespread, one should proceed to draw out the black fluid repeatedly, and then cut it out if it is in the veins with clear fullness.
Then, apply a bandage to hold the cancer firmly, and then insert the appropriate hooks into the cancer.  Remove it from every direction along with the skin, thoroughly, until no part of its roots remains.  Allow the blood to flow, do not stop it quickly.
Instead, squeeze the affected areas and extract all the thick blood with your hands or with any suitable tools.  If during the procedure a significant bleed occurs from a severed artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with further methods until healed.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the treatment of ulcers.
We have informed you about the different types of dropsy, how water accumulates, the signs of each type, and its treatment with medication.  Only the 'thick' type of dropsy is treated with iron.  The 'thin' or 'fleshy' types should not be treated with iron at all.
If you have treated this 'thick' type of ulcer with medication and it has not been effective, check if the patient has become extremely weak or has another illness besides the ulcer, such as...
If the patient has a cough, diarrhea, or similar ailments, do not treat with iron, for that is dangerous. If you see that the patient is strong, has no illness other than the ulcer, and is neither a child nor an old person, then the procedure is to have the patient stand before you. and a servant behind him to press his abdomen with his hands, pushing the water downwards towards the pubic area.  Then take a pointed scalpel, like this:
It should be narrow at both ends, long, and pointed, like a scalpel, but with a slight curve to prevent it from going too far into the intestines and harming them. Then, examine if the ulcer originated from the intestines.
If the ulcer originated from a liver ailment, the incision should be three fingers below the navel, aligned with the pubic bone.  If the ulcer originated from a spleen ailment, the incision should be three fingers to the right of the navel.
Also, the incision should not be on the side the patient intends to lie on, to prevent discharge from flowing to that weakened area.  Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument, and insert the instrument into the incision, and lift your hand.
With the scalpel, separate the skin from the peritoneum as if you were peeling it, to the extent of a fingernail or similar. Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, the location of the fluid, then remove the fluid and insert the instrument of this shape into the opening.
It is like a thin tube made of silver, copper, or smooth polished leather.  It has a small hole at the bottom and three holes on the sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
A small needle-like tip may be placed on the end, like the nib of a pen, in this form.
At its upper end is a ring.  When the instrument reaches the fluid, it will drain onto the instrument, draining a moderate amount of fluid at a time.  If you drain more than is necessary at once, the patient might die from the dissolution of their animal spirit.
Or he may experience a near-fatal faint. But drain it according to his strength, guided by the patient's pulse and complexion.  Then remove the instrument and retain the fluid, as it will collect at once.
Because of the skin that holds the perforation in the peritoneum, which you were instructed to apply to in that manner, and then repeat the procedure another day, if you find the patient able to tolerate it.
Also remove a small amount of fluid, doing this for several days while staying vigilant and avoiding mistakes, so that only a little fluid remains.  If you fear for the patient and leave too much fluid, treat him by burying him in hot sand.
Excessive sweating in the bath and sun, enduring thirst, treating with dried medications until he recovers, and cauterizing the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the fluid as described previously.
Chapter Fifty-five.
In treating children born with unperforated or narrow or misplaced urinary openings.
Some boys may be born with an unperforated scrotum; it is necessary to perforate it from the moment of birth.
With a very thin scalpel in this manner.
Then a thin lead nail is placed in the opening, tied, and held for three or four days.  When urination is desired, it is removed, and the area is cleaned, then the nail is replaced. If no lead is used, it is possible that the urine flowing to the area will prevent it from closing.
And as for those with a narrow opening, it is treated with lead, as we said, for many days until it widens.  And those whose opening is in the wrong place, meaning some are born with the opening at the end of the scrotum so that they cannot urinate forward.
Until he raises the urethra upward with his hand.  It is not born before the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line, which is a very ugly condition.  The method of treatment in this case is for the patient to lie on his back.
Then, with your left hand, stretch his scrotum forcefully, and trim the head of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel, like a pen's nib, or as if carving something so that its center protrudes like a scrotum, and the opening will be in the middle, as it should be.
Be careful of bleeding during your work, as it often occurs.  Stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-six.
In the ulcer that appears in the sheath, scrotum, blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the sheath to the scrotum.
This ulcer often occurs in the urethra, being a fleshy, dark growth, which may be malignant or not.  The non-malignant one should be pulled out with a gentle snare.
Cut it completely clean, then apply a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment.  Afterwards, treat it with palm ointment until it heals.  If the ulcer is malignant, dark-colored, cauterization should be applied after cutting and cleaning it.
If the ulcer is in the sheath of an uncircumcised male, and some of the ulcer is inside the sheath and some outside, one should remove the ulcer from inside first, and when it has healed, then treat the outside.
Because if you treat them together, you cannot be sure that the sheath will not perforate.  It can also appear in women, and in the sheath, blackness and corruption can appear; therefore, all blackened areas that threaten or have already become corrupt should be cauterized.
Then apply honey mixed with crushed and sifted pomegranate rind and carsonna to it. Then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use a crescent-shaped cautery iron in this manner.
Cauterization is beneficial in both cases, namely, bleeding and ulceration of the wound. If the foreskin is completely destroyed at any time, a lead pipe should be inserted into the urethra for the patient to urinate through. As for the adhesion of the sheath to the glans...
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin was healthy and who were not circumcised.  Adhesion can also result from a wound or tumor.  It is necessary to dissect it with a sharp scalpel until the ligament is loosened and the glans is free on all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them upon examination, then some of the glans and foreskin should be dissected. The foreskin is thin, and it might tear easily due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin and glans with a thin linen cloth that has been dipped in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat with a styptic drink until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-seven.
In the purification of boys and the treatment of their errors.
Circumcision is nothing more than separating a connection, like other surgical procedures, but since it is something we do intentionally, and is used particularly in boys, we must establish the best course of action.
The easiest path to safety, I say, is that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is something we have adopted.
By experience, for I have found the majority of craftsmen and barbers using purification with a knife and scissors, and using a bandage with thread, and cutting with a nail.  I have tried all these methods.
So I have found nothing better than purification with scissors and bandaging with thread, because purification with a knife often causes the skin to tear, since the foreskin has two layers; it might cut the upper layer and leave the lower layer.
He may be forced to make another cut, and further pain; purification with a cupping tool does not provide protection against cutting the end of the urethra because it might enter its opening, and purification with a nail might cause the skin to tear and spoil your work, or the boy's skin might naturally be too short.
Often, they are born in such a way that they do not need purification; and I have seen this.  As for purification with scissors and bandaging with thread, experience has shown me its superiority because scissors have a proportionate cut, as the blade above is the same as the blade below.
When you squeeze your hand with the blades in proportion, the cut is uniform and in one time.  This makes the thread's grip similar to a wall against the urethra's skin on all sides; there will be no mistake.  First, you must calm the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little, that you are only tying the thread to his urethra and leaving it until another day, then, make him happy and pleased in every way that you can do so, and what his mind accepts.  Then, make him stand before you, upright.
Do not have him sit, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot.  Do not let the boy's eyes see them, nor any of the instruments. Then, insert your hand into his urethra, inflate the skin, and lift it upwards until the head of the urethra emerges.
Then, clean it of any accumulated dirt.  Then tie the marked area with a doubled thread. Then, tie a second bandage slightly below that.  Then, using your thumb and index finger, hold the lower bandage firmly, and cut between the two bandages. Then quickly lift the skin upwards and remove the head of the urethra.  Then allow the blood to flow a little; this is better and lessens swelling of the urethra.  Then dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle over it the ashes of burnt dry gourd (pumpkin), which is the best I have tried, or the powder of dried hawthorn; that is also excellent.
Then quickly lift the skin upwards and remove the head of the urethra.  Then allow the blood to flow a little; this is better and lessens swelling of the urethra.  Then dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle over it the ashes of burnt dry gourd (pumpkin), which is the best I have tried, or the powder of dried hawthorn; that is also excellent. Then apply to the affected area, from above, a cloth containing a beaten hard-boiled egg in rosewater mixed with soft, good rose oil. Leave it on for another day, then continue with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
This is a suitable scissors design for the procedure.
The scissors should have straight, sharp blades, like a nail clipper.  The length of the blades should be equal to the length of the handles.  A mistake in the procedure might involve the inversion of some or all of the inner skin during cutting; therefore, you should stretch it with your fingernail as soon as possible before the affected area swells.
Cut it [the skin] evenly.  If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with tweezers and cut it. If three days pass and the area beneath the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, let the acute swelling subside, then gently dissect it.
Cut it as best you can, being careful around the head of the urethra.  If a bit of the urethral head is cut, it will not harm; treat the wound with the cauterants described in the chapter on cauterants.
If more skin is cut than necessary and it retracts, this is also not very harmful. Treat it as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-eight.
On treating urine retention in the bladder.
Obstructed urine in the bladder occurs due to blockage by a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or a growing mass, and the like. If you treat it with the various treatments described in the classification, this will help.
If the urine does not flow and you suspect the obstruction is due to a stone damaging the neck of the bladder, the patient should be placed on their knees, then a person should sit on their back, stretching their abdomen toward the back, and the patient should hold on as much as possible.
This will force the neck of the bladder to push the stone backward, allowing the urine to flow. If the urine does not flow with this method and the patient's condition worsens, then the removal of the obstruction should be attempted with the instrument called a catheter, whose image is shown here.
It is made of silver, thin and smooth, hollow like a bird's feather tube, about one and a half spans long, with a gentle funnel at its head.  The method for drawing the urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie a piece of wool or cotton securely to one end.
The thread end is inserted into the lower part of the catheter, and any excess wool is trimmed with pliers so that it fits snugly inside the tube, like a button.  Then, the catheter is lubricated with oil, butter, or egg white, and the patient sits on a chair.
The bladder and urethra are softened with moist ointments or warm oil and water.  The catheter is then gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra.  Then, the urethra is pulled upward towards the navel, and the catheter is pushed inside.
Once the urethra is pulled, the catheter is pushed inward until it nears the anus.  The penis is then tilted downward, while the catheter is inside, and pushed further until it reaches the bladder, where the patient will feel it has reached an empty space.
This is done in this way because the urinary passage has curves.  Then, the thread with the wool is pulled gently, so the urine follows the wool.  It is then removed, and the urine is drained, and the catheter is withdrawn.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Images of the instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or ivory, hollowed out, with a long tube thin like pus.  Water and medicines are to be dripped into it using an instrument called a syringe.  This is its image.
Made of silver or ivory, hollowed out, with a long tube, thin like a reed, hollowed out entirely except for the tip, which is solid.  There are three holes in it: two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
The hollow space where the nozzle is will be just enough to hold it without any extra space.  Thus, when you pull it, any moisture will be pulled, and if you push it, it will be pushed far away, as the oil-thrower used in naval warfare does.
If you want to expel moisture from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull up with the nozzle.  The moisture will be drawn into the syringe.  Then, insert the tip into the urethra, as described for catheters.  Then, push the moisture out with the nozzle.
Then, that moisture will reach the bladder in the appropriate amount, until the patient feels it.  This is also an image of a gentle syringe used to irrigate the bladder.
It is made of silver or lead, its upper head resembling a small funnel.  Below it is a groove where the cord fits.  Then, a camel's bladder is taken, and the moisture to be injected into the bladder is placed inside.  Then, it is firmly tied between the two parts with a doubled thread.
Warm that moisture slightly over the fire. Then, insert the tip of the irrigator into the urethra.  Then, firmly press on the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment, make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around.  Then, insert a strong thread into those holes in a circular manner.  Then, gather the circle like a napkin is gathered, after putting into it what you want of moistures, oils, and water.
Then tie it to the instrument and use it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On removing stones.
We have previously discussed the types of stones, their treatment with medications, and the differences between kidney stones and bladder stones, along with the signs of each.  We have also mentioned the stones that require manual removal and incision.
These are the stones originating in the bladder, specifically those that form in the urethra. I will describe this clearly and concisely.
I say that bladder stones are most often found in young boys.  A sign of this is that the urine passes from the bladder, thin like water.
Sand appears in the urine, and he rubs and fiddles with his penis.  Often the penis hangs down, and the anus prolapses in many of them.  Young boys recover easily from this up to the age of fourteen, while it is harder in the elderly; young men lie in between these two extremes.
Those with larger stones have easier treatment, and the opposite is true for smaller ones.  Thus, regarding treatment, first the patient should be given an enema to remove all the waste from his bowels, as this can hinder the examination for stones.
Then the patient is taken by the legs and shaken downward to bring the stone to the neck of the bladder, or he is made to jump repeatedly from a high place.  Then, he is seated upright before you, with his hands under his thighs, so that the entire bladder tilts downwards, and then he is examined.
Feel for the stone from the outside.  If you feel a stone in the space, immediately begin to cut into it.  If it does not come into contact with your touch at all, then you should smear the index finger (if the patient is a boy) or the middle finger with grease from your left hand.
If it is a fully grown boy, insert it into his anus and search for the stone. Once it is under your finger, move it little by little toward the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it out toward the location you intend to cut.
And order a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and order another servant to stretch his right hand towards the upper part of the vulva and, with his other hand, stretch the skin below the vulva toward the location of the incision. Then take the lancet, which has this shape:
Incise between the anus and the vulva, not in the middle, but to the side of the left groin. The incision should be on the same spot as the stone, and your finger should be in the anus, pushing it outward obliquely, so that the incision is wide from the outside and narrow from the inside, to the extent that the stone can be removed from it.
Do not make it too large; perhaps the finger in the anus will push the stone out during the incision without difficulty.  Know that some stones may have angles and edges, making their removal difficult.
Some are smooth, like acorns, and rounded, making removal easier; those with angles and edges should have the incision enlarged a little.  If it still does not come out, then a clever method should be employed, such as grasping it with a firm forceps, its tip like a file.
To grip the stone so it does not slip; or, introduce a delicate, curved instrument underneath it. If that fails, widen the incision a little. If you encounter significant bleeding, stop it with a cautery.
If there is more than one stone, first push the largest into the bladder opening, then incise on it.  Then push out the smaller one(s).  Do likewise if there are more than two. If the stones are very large, it is foolish to make a large incision on them, because the patient will suffer one of two things.
Either he will die, or he will suffer constant dribbling of urine, as the area will never heal properly.  However, try pushing it out; or, devise a method to break it with forceps until it is removed completely.
Once your work is finished, treat the wound with kandar, sabr, sheyan, and a tight bandage.  Place a soaked cloth in oil and drink or rose oil and cold water over it to relieve the inflammation.  The patient should then lie on their back.  Do not remove the bandage until the third day.
Once the swelling subsides, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with the palm ointment and basil ointment until it heals. If a further inflammatory swelling, ulceration, or similar problem develops in the wound, such as clotting of blood within the bladder, which prevents urination, and this is evident by blood in the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove the blood, for if it remains, it will lead to bladder corruption and festering. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of issue with a corresponding remedy until it heals.
During all treatments, the thighs should be bound together to secure the medications applied to the area.  If the stone is small and located in the urethra, causing inflammation and preventing urination, treat it with the methods I've described before it reaches a rupture.
I have often avoided incision with this treatment.  I have tested using a lancet made of hardened steel, with a shape like this:
The tip of the lancet is sharp, pointed, and fixed to a stick.  Then, take a thread and tie it around the penis beneath the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder.  Then, carefully insert the lancet into the urethra until the lancet reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the lancet slightly within the stone, aiming to pierce it until it exits from the other side.  Urine will then flow immediately.  Then, press on the remaining portion of the stone outside the penis; it will break up and be expelled with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not possible due to an obstacle, tie a thread below the stone and another above the stone.  Then, make an incision on the stone within the penis between the two threads, and remove it.
Then, loosen the threads and clean the congealed blood in the wound.  The thread was tied below the stone so that it would not return to the bladder, and the other thread was tied above it so that when the thread is loosened after the stone is removed, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when tying the upper thread, you should lift the skin upward so that it returns and covers the wound as we have said.
Chapter Sixty-one.
In removing stones in women.
Stones rarely form in women. If one of them has a stone, it is difficult to treat and is often impossible for many reasons, one of which is that the woman might be a virgin, and another is that you will not find a woman who allows herself to the physician.
If she is chaste or from those with restrictions, and a third, that you will not find a woman who excels in this craft, especially working by hand, and a fourth, that the incision site on the stone in women is far from the stone's location, requiring a deep incision.
And in this, there is danger. If necessity demands it, one should seek a skilled female physician, which is rare. If you cannot find one, seek a reputable, chaste physician or bring a skilled female midwife or a woman knowledgeable in this craft.
You should bring her in and instruct her to perform all examinations of the stone first.  If the woman is a virgin, you should insert a finger into her vagina to search for the stone. If found, press it down under her finger.
Then instruct her to make the incision. If she is not a virgin but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it firmly.
If she finds it, she should guide it from the opening of the bladder downwards as far as possible, until it reaches the root of the thigh, and then make the incision on the side of the vagina's midpoint, at the root of the thigh, from whichever side feels the stone in that area.
Her finger should not leave the stone, pressing it underneath.  The incision should initially be small.  Then, a probe should be inserted into that small opening. If she feels the stone, she should widen the cut as much as necessary to remove the stone.  Know that there are many types of stones.
There are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and branched stones.  Know their types so you can understand what you are dealing with.  If blood flows excessively, sprinkle the crushed za'aj on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your work.
Until the stone is removed.  Prepare the instruments mentioned in the removal of stones for men to assist you in your work. If excessive bleeding occurs, and you know the bleeding is from a severed artery, place a cauterization tool on the area.
Apply a tight bandage with the dressings and leave it; do not reapply. Leave the stone; do not remove it.  The patient might die.  Then treat the wound.  When the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area is infected, return to your work until the stone is removed.
Chapter Sixty-two.
In the opening of the hydrocele.
Hydrocele is the accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum that is beneath the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle.  It may also be in a special membrane that nature has prepared for it on one side of the testicle.
So that one might think it another testicle, and it is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum that we mentioned. This only happens rarely. This hydrocele arises from weakness, which is common to females, and this material is deposited there; a blow to the scrotum may also cause it.
This moisture may have various colors; it may be yellow, or blood-red, or dark-grey, or whitish like water, and the latter is the most frequent.  The signs by which it is recognized are...
Where the water collects, if it is in the white peritoneum that we mentioned, the swelling is somewhat oblong, like an egg, and the testicle is not visible, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a membrane specific to it, the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle.
For this reason, one might imagine it to be another testicle. If the moisture is between the scrotum and the white peritoneum, it is palpable.  To determine the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe, as its image was previously shown.  Judge the color by what emerges from beneath the probe.
If we proceed to treatment with iron, the patient should be bled if possible, and if you see that their body is full, then the patient should lie on their back on something slightly elevated, with many cloths placed underneath.  Then you sit on their left side.
And instruct a servant to sit on his right side, extending the patient's penis to one side of the scrotum and towards the groin.  Then, take a wide scalpel and incise the scrotum lengthwise from the middle to near the pubic area.
The incision should be straight, parallel to the line dividing the scrotum in half, until you reach the white peritoneum.  Carefully dissect it, taking care not to cut it.  Your dissection should be primarily along the side that adheres to the testicle, and continue as far as possible.
Then, make a wide incision into the water-filled peritoneum and remove all the water.  Then, separate the edges of the incision with forceps, and lift the peritoneum upward, avoiding touching the scrotal skin.  Cut the peritoneum as much as possible, either in one piece or in sections.
Especially the thin part, for if you do not completely cut it, you cannot be sure the water will not return.  If the testicle protrudes from the skin during your work, replace it and then stitch together the edges of the scrotal skin.
Then treat it as you would any other surgical wound until it heals.  If the testicle has been damaged by another illness, you should tie off the vessels in the sac to prevent bleeding, and then remove the testicle from the sac and take out the testicle.  Then treat it as previously described.
If the accumulated water is in both sides, know that they are two separate sacs.  Incise the other side in the same manner as the first, or if you prefer to work in a single procedure, do so.  Then wipe away the blood.
Insert wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions.  Place another layer of wool soaked in a mixture of syrup and oil over the testicles and the abdominal area.  Put folded bandages (the *rafayd*) over that. Tie it down from above with a bandage having six ends, in this manner.
Then take two bandages, sew them together, and fill them with fluffy wool, in this manner.  Make the ends for tying from cotton or damp wool.  Secure the bandages with a belt tightened around the waist, one end extending up toward the back on the buttocks.
The second end extends toward the pubic area, and the other two ends go down the thighs.  The remaining two ends go to the upper thighs.  Tighten the whole thing with a belt around the waist.  This dressing can also be made using cautery instead of incision with an iron.
This involves using a gentle, heated scalpel to incise the scrotum, until the white membrane containing water is exposed. Take another cautery iron, in this manner:
It resembles a Greek eye.  Then use it to cauterize the membrane, while it is hot, until all the moisture is removed.  Then pull the membrane with hooks, and cauterize and cut the surrounding layer as much as possible to remove all of it, avoiding the egg, so that the fire does not touch it.
Know that this method is safer and prevents bleeding, and is better than using incision. If during the incision or cauterization, a hot swelling, or bleeding, or something else arises, it is necessary to treat whatever arises with the appropriate treatment as previously described.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot tolerate this procedure because of its unpleasantness, then let him use the cauterization as I have described, if it is suitable to him according to what has been presented before as evidence.
If the discharge is watery, the patient should be seated on a raised chair. Then, cauterize the swelling at its base with a wide spatula. Make the cauterization along the body, and make the opening wide enough for all the water to drain. Then, place cotton on the area and bandage it.
Leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not come out during the cauterization, it is because the white membrane is obstructing the opening of the wound, preventing the water from draining.
In that case, you should insert a goose feather, or the instrument used to extract water from abscesses, whose image was previously presented, or enlarge the wound slightly.
Know that the water may return and collect after six months or so. If it collects, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient should endure the days.
Chapter Sixty-three.
On the incision of fleshy sores and their treatment.
Know that incisions on these fleshy sores are fraught with danger, leading to death in most cases. Therefore, we recommend leaving them alone and avoiding them.  I will now describe the treatments and various types of tumors.
I say that many tumors can arise in the bodies where the female organs are located.  This may be due to various causes, either from a sharp fluid discharge into the female organs or a blow.  The color of the tumor is the same as the body's color, and there is no water [in it].
The tumor is hard, and it may be a hardened mass, dark in color and without sensation. It may also arise from the twisting and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from the swelling of the veins.  If from the swelling of the arteries, this is recognized by the tumor's dispersion.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be incised at all.  However, if from the swelling of the veins, nothing disperses when pressed with the fingers.  This type can be incised, as well as other fleshy tissues.
This involves incising the scrotum, then lifting the testicle upward and removing it from the white peritoneum.  The adhesion is separated from the vessels, the vessels are tied off, and the adhesion is cut after being freed from every part of the testicle.  This is if the testicle is adhered to those growing tissues.
Therefore, the testicle should be removed and cut if there is an adhesion between parts of the peritoneum or between the vessels.  In that case, all such adhesions must be freed and cut in a circular fashion.
If the fleshy growth is in the area of adhesion behind, all of it must be cut and the testicle removed, as we said.  Once your work is complete, treat the wound with wet wool soaked in rose-scented oil and drink, then continue treatment until healed.
Chapter Sixty-four.
On treating dropsy associated with dropsy.
Dropsy is a swollen, somewhat twisted lump, resembling a cluster, with relaxation of the thighs, making movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the afflicted person.  In treating this affliction, the method is similar to that previously described.
However, it is necessary to mention the method used by our predecessors. I say that the afflicted person should sit on a raised chair, then pull the thighs downward, and then hold the scrotum with your fingers, along with the vessels close to the penis.
A servant of yours should hold it and stretch it forcefully.  Then, using a broad, sharp scalpel, make a slanted incision next to the vessels until they are exposed.  Then, dissect from every side, as I described for the dissection of the arteries in the temples, and insert a needle with a doubled thread into them.
Tie the threads at the initial points where the dropsy appeared and also at the end of it.  Then, cut it open in the middle, vertically along the body, and remove the accumulated foul, corrupted moisture.
Then treat the wound like any other surgical wound that needs time to heal.  Removing the vessels that nourish one thigh is acceptable. If the dropsy affects all the vessels, then one thigh should be removed along with the vessels so that the egg does not lack nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, it will wilt and be of no use.
Chapter Sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal dropsy.
This dropsy occurs when a rupture appears in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen, near the groin area of the abdominal walls, causing the intestines to protrude into one of the thighs.
This hernia may be either from a rupture in the peritoneum or from its extension.  These two types occur from many causes, such as a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting a heavy object, and the like.  If it is from an extension of the peritoneum, the hernia will develop gradually over a long time.
It does not appear suddenly. The swelling is flat and roughly deep, as the peritoneum compresses the intestines.  If the hernia is from a rupture in the peritoneum, it will initially cause great pain immediately and the swelling will be noticeably different, appearing under the skin nearby.
This is due to the intestines protruding outward from the peritoneum.  Pus may also exit with the intestines, in which case the dropsy is described as intestinal and purulent.  It may also be accompanied by gas, or the intestines may contain fecal matter that becomes trapped, leading to the patient's demise.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially when compressed.  Treating these types of illnesses with iron is dangerous, so one should avoid it.  The method is to instruct the patient to push the intestines back into the abdominal cavity with their hand if they can be returned.
Then, the patient lies supine with you at their side, raising their legs.  Then, you pull up the skin near the groin and make a lengthwise incision through the entire scrotal skin.  Then, you insert hooks into the edges of the incision, as much as necessary to open the cut further.
The incision should be as wide as possible to allow the testicle to emerge.  Then, peel back the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin until the white, hard peritoneum is exposed on all sides.  Then, insert your index finger behind the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum beneath the testicle's skin and the second peritoneum, separate the adhesions behind the testicle.  Then, with your right hand, pull inward on the scrotal skin.  Simultaneously, with your left hand, pull the white peritoneum upward, lifting the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision.
You instruct the attendant to pull the testicle upward.  You completely detach the adhesions behind it.  Use your finger to check for any twisted intestines within the tough white peritoneum.  If you find any, push them back into the abdominal cavity below.
Then, take a needle with a thick thread, twisted from ten strands, and insert it at the edge of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin near the incision.  Then, cut the ends of the thread so that four strands remain. Then, join some of the strands together in a knotted fashion and tie the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin firmly on both sides.  Then also wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that no blood vessels feeding it can reach it. So that a hot swelling does not result.  Also make a second ligature outside the first, at least two finger-widths away.  After these two ligatures, leave a portion of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a fingertip.
So that a hot swelling does not result.  Also make a second ligature outside the first, at least two finger-widths away.  After these two ligatures, leave a portion of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a fingertip. Cut the rest completely around and remove the testicle. Then, make an incision below the scrotal skin that bleeds and drains as described previously.  Then, use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and use the ligature we described.
The white peritoneum, which we mentioned after cutting it, may require cauterization to prevent bleeding, as this often occurs.  Leave the ligature until it falls off on its own. If it falls off slowly, apply hot water and something that will make it sweat to cause it to fall off.
Then treat the wound with the standard treatment for surgical wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-six.
In this type of wind colic, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron.  The ancients mentioned making it as described in the colic with a dhalia, meaning to tie the vessels gently below the incision.
Then cut through the middle and treat the swelling to open it, until the vessels fall out. Then treat the wound as previously described until healed.
Chapter Seventy-six.
In the hernia that occurs in the groin.
The hernia in the groin may appear, as we said, but nothing from the intestines descends into the groin.  If it does descend, it is slight and returns at all times.
However, if it lasts a long time, the tear in the peritoneum increases so that the intestines and the testicles descend into the scrotum.  This appears from the extension of the peritoneum in the groin, as we said. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and protrudes the area, and its treatment is with cauterization, as I previously described.
And it may be treated with an iron in this manner: The patient lies on their back before you, then you make a transverse incision in the swollen, protruding hernia site, about the width of three fingers, and then cauterize the peritoneum beneath the skin.
Until the underlying white peritoneum is exposed. Then take a thread and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum, pressing it towards the depth of the abdomen, and then stitch the two protruding areas on the thread end of the peritoneum, fastening one to the other with the stitches.
Then pull the thread, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I informed you in the treatment of intestinal protrusions. Then treat it with surgical treatment.
When the threads are cut, clean and close the wound until it heals, then the peritoneum contracts, and the hernia protrusion does not increase.
And this is the best method in this case, because it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the scrotum.
The scrotum often relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, which makes it unsightly.  Therefore, whoever desires to treat this should have the patient lie on their back.
Cut all the relaxed skin from the thick skin, then bring the edges together.  If you wish, first stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, secure the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other surgical wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
The sixty-ninth chapter.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
For this reason, I should not mention it in this book of mine. However, I have mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that it may be part of the physician's knowledge when questioned about it, and so that the afflicted may be treated, and the other that we frequently need to castrate certain animals for our own benefit.
Like sheep, oxen, and cats, and animals of that sort, I say that castration comes in two forms: either by crushing or by cutting and severing.  For that which is done by crushing, the method is that we place the animal in hot water until its testicles relax and soften and hang down.
Then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer discernible to the touch.  As for castration by cutting and severing, it is necessary to hold the animal and compress the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the cords and make a single cut on each testicle.
Until the testicles emerge, then cut them after peeling them, leaving nothing of the membranes except the thin membrane that covers the vessels. This method of castration is better than that which is done by crushing.
Because crushing might leave some of the testicles, and the animal might desire mating, then treat the wound until it heals.
Seventieth Chapter.
On the treatment of hermaphrodites.
Hermaphrodites in men occur in two types. One type appears in the area near the testicles, between the testicles, resembling a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from the area within the scrotal skin.
In women, there is one type, located above the vulva on the pubis, like small, protruding male testicles.  One of them resembles a male penis, and both resemble female genitalia.  And the treatment for these three types.
The two types of men and the single type of women, the excess flesh must be cut away until the effects are gone, then treated with the usual surgical procedures until healed. As for the second type of men from whom urine emerges from the scrotal skin, no treatment is necessary and no improvement will result.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On the cutting of the clitoris and the protruding flesh of women's vulvas.
The clitoris may increase beyond its natural size, becoming unsightly and inflamed. In some women, it may enlarge to the extent of resembling a penis, interfering with sexual intercourse.
One should hold the excess clitoris with one's hand or forceps and cut it off, but not excessively or deeply into the root, so as to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical remedies until it heals.  As for the proliferating flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the uterus, filling it.
And sometimes it protrudes outward, like a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients called it the "tail-like disease," and it should be cut off, just like the clitoris, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On the treatment of ruptures.
Rupture is when a woman's vagina is not perforated, or the perforation is small, and it may be either natural, present at birth, or accidental.  The accidental rupture is due to a prior cause, and it may arise from excess, growing flesh.
Or from thin or thick peritoneum, and may be located deep within the uterus, or on its sides, or at the top or bottom, and it prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and possibly menstruation.  This is determined by the midwife's examination.
If the obstruction is visible and close, then if it is not visible, she should investigate it with her fingers or with a probe. If the obstruction is from thin peritoneum and is close to the labia, then hasten to pierce it; this is done by placing something like a flap over the labia, and then place the thumbs of both hands together.
And the woman should be lying on her back with her legs spread apart. Then, firmly stretch the labia until the thin peritoneum is pierced and the obstruction is opened.  Then, take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area. The woman should be treated daily so that the area does not close again.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, it should be cut with a broad scalpel, resembling a thin leaf. If the obstruction is from a growth of flesh, then grasp it with forceps and cut it off. Have with you remedies to stop bleeding without cauterizing, such as acacia, myrrh, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then, use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly. Hold it for several days, and use a thread of dry linen, then treat it with the usual treatment for abscesses until it heals.  Another growth of flesh might appear in the uterus, which should also be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, the cancerous tumor that occurs in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On treating hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that appear in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the veins' mouths, causing frequent copious bleeding.  If hemorrhoids progress, they become warts.  Their types and signs were mentioned in the classification, and we will discuss them here.
As for what is curable and what is not, I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep within the uterus and not perceptible by touch, have no cure with iron.  Those in the mouth of the uterus, where they are perceptible, are the ones that are treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, and then the warts should be scraped with a lancet or a rough cloth, and cut from their roots.  Then, after bleeding from one of the blood-cutting lancets, but without pricking, powder should be applied to them.
Like qaqia, sheyan, and frankincense, and similar things.  Then, raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them in cold water.  If the bleeding persists, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, and oak bark, and similar things.  Then, take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
Apply this to her back. If the bleeding stops, good.  Otherwise, keep applying cupping to the back, breasts and chest without restrictions.  Then, take wool, dip it in the juice of plantain, or the juice of comfrey, or the juice of willow branches, with oak bark drink, and apply it to the affected area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until healed.  As for the red sore, it resembles the heads of warts, rough in appearance.  It is necessary to cut off what is visible of it, in the same manner as with the warts, and treat it until healed.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the treatment of abscesses in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may appear in the uterus, such as cancer, hard tumors, ulcers, gangrene, consuming ulcers, polyps, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and inflamed tumors.  All of these diseases and their types and signs have been described in the classification.
Therefore, in this section, we must discuss the inflamed tumor appearing in the uterus, if it is one of the tumors that accumulate over time. How should it be treated with iron?  One must observe if the pain of the tumor at its beginning is severe, with throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
And if you see it red, do not rush to treat it with iron. Treat it with what aids in maturation until these symptoms subside. Then, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats, leaning back.
And she should bring her legs together towards the lower abdomen, with her thighs spread apart, and place her arms below her knees, binding them with a suitable bandage.
Then, the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument to open the cervix, the image of which will come later.  When using this instrument, one must estimate the depth of the woman's uterus, so that what enters the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
For if the instrument is deeper than the depth, then pads should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the uterus's depth. The coil that runs through the instrument should be on the upper side.
While you hold the instrument, the attendant turns the coil to open the cervix.  If a boil appears and can be felt by hand, soft and thin, it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel.  If the entire abscess has discharged.
A soft wick dipped in rose oil or green oil with some astringent should be placed in the wound.  The wick should come out of the incision in the cervix, and pure wool soaked in boiled baker's water should be placed externally on the uterus and pubis.
Then, after two days, it should be treated with the appropriate ointment until healed.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting water and honey, then water in which the root of sow thistle or long wormwood has been boiled.  Then return to the ointment. This is if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
Iron should not be used to treat it; rather, it should be treated as described in the classification.
Chapter Seventy-five.
On instructing midwives on how to treat living fetuses that emerge in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the natural form of childbirth.  Signs include seeing the woman lean forward, desire to smell the air, and lessen her discomfort from the lochia.
And if the fetus emerges quickly, know that this birth is natural.  It will emerge head-first, with the placenta either attached or hanging from its navel. If you see these signs, you should gently press her abdomen to hasten the delivery of the fetus.
If it descends head-first, the placenta descends with it, and is cleansed thoroughly from impurities.  Any birth other than this is unnatural and reprehensible, as the fetus may emerge feet-first, with hands or feet emerging before the head.
And the fetus may emerge with one hand or one foot, or with its head and a hand, or emerge curled, or perhaps turn upside down, and so on, are all reprehensible forms. Therefore, the midwife must be skillful and gentle with all these things and beware of errors and mistakes.
And I explain each form and how to handle it, so you may recognize it and understand it. If the fetus emerges head-first—the natural way—and the woman experiences significant difficulty and her strength weakens, have her sit on a chair and direct women to assist her.
Wrap her womb with boiled dates and moist ointments. Then, the midwife should insert a small scalpel between her fingers and cut the placenta, or cut it with her fingernail, so that the moisture within it flows out, and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, the woman should be injected with the juice of dates and sherj ointment.  Then, after the injection, she should be induced to cough and be given a sneeze with a spoon, and her mouth and nose should be held. The fetus will emerge at once. If the fetus's hands emerge first, it is necessary to gently push them back, little by little.
If entry is not possible, place the woman on a stool, raising her legs upward. Then shake the stool on the ground, while the woman holds on to prevent falling during the shaking.  If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut off the hands and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them gently, for it will emerge.  If the fetus emerges on its feet, the feet should be pushed upward, then the fetus should be turned gradually until it is straightened, then one of the feet should be gently pulled.
If they emerge to the thighs, instruct her to cough and sneeze with a spoon, for it will emerge. If it does not emerge as described, gently reposition the fetus until it is in its natural position, then it will emerge smoothly. If it still does not emerge by all of the described methods...
Take some juice of *al-khatmi*, juice of dates, sherj ointment, and dissolved gum. Grind them well in a mortar. Then apply this mixture to the woman's vulva and lower abdomen.  Then seat her in lukewarm water until the sharaaseef are reached.
If you see that her lower part has softened, make her a compress of myrrh and let her endure it. If she holds the compress for an hour, seat her on a chair, then make her sneeze, and close her mouth and nose, and gently press on her lower abdomen. Then the fetus will emerge immediately. The fetus will emerge on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, gently insert your hands, then the woman should lie on her back, her feet dangling down while lying on a bed, and hold her hands. Then gently press on her upper abdomen. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her feet are elevated. If the fetus does not emerge, take both her legs and move them vigorously. Then press gently on above the sharaaseef until the fetus rises.  Then the midwife should insert her hand and gently reshape the fetus.
Tell the woman to strain until the fetus emerges. The fetus emerges sideways, with one arm hanging down.  Try to straighten the arm. If you cannot straighten it, make the woman stand, and have her walk. If she cannot walk, have her lie down.
Shake her legs vigorously, then use the lubricant described using saliva. If the delivery is complete, seat her on a chair, then work to straighten the arm and put the fetus in its normal position. Make the woman sneeze and tell her to strain until it emerges.
If the fetus emerges on its back, with outstretched arms, and its face towards the mother's back, the midwife should grasp the fetus's hand and gently turn it and straighten it.  Once straightened, apply the grease and saliva we have previously described to the area.
Then tell her to move slowly. When she does, seat her on a chair and instruct her to lean to her right side.  Then tell her to strain and make her sneeze with a stick. This will cause it to emerge.  The fetus emerges upright on its side.
If it descends into the cervix in this condition, along with the placenta, split the placenta with your fingernail until it is free of moisture. If it is clinging to the fetus's face and neck, cut it from the umbilical cord to prevent suffocation and death. Then push the fetus inwards until it is in the correct position.
Tell the woman to strain repeatedly; this will cause an easy delivery.  For the delivery of twins or multiple fetuses, know that twins often are born, and three or four may be born and live, but this is rare.  However, five is something unnatural, and they will not live at all.
And they are surrounded by a single placenta, even if numerous.  They are separated by a membrane, a partition, connected to the umbilical cord of each one.  They may emerge in the same way as a single fetus, normally and easily, or they may emerge in a way that is considered undesirable, as described.
If any of them are difficult to deliver and present the unnatural forms we have mentioned, treat them as described.  Let the midwife be gentle, and do everything with care, patience, and ingenuity, finding a method that leads to safety.
Descriptions of fetuses conceived in the womb that may be miscarried.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived. I have heard that one woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all conceived.
By the estimation of the All-Knowing, All-Wise, all of this should be part of a midwife's knowledge.  Perhaps such a thing might happen to her someday, and she should respond appropriately.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
In the extraction of a dead fetus.
If you treat a dead fetus using the methods described in the classification and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use manual extraction, then you should observe. If the woman is strong and healthy, and there are no symptoms that suggest potential harm, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
Her head should be tilted downwards, her legs raised, and an assistant should hold her from both sides or tie her to the bed to prevent her body from shifting when the fetus is being extracted.
Then, the mouth of her uterus is moistened with the moist ointments, along with the saliva of the *khatmi*, and the powders of fenugreek and linseed. Then, the midwife anoints her hands with these ointments and saliva, then gently inserts them into the uterus. Then, she seeks out a suitable location to insert the hooks into the fetus, and the corresponding locations for that.
Observe if the fetus is easily descended, head first. If so, insert the hooks into its eyes, or nape, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or collarbone, or into the areas near the ribs, or under the clavicles.
And if it descends feet first, then in the pubic area and the middle ribs.  One should grasp the hook with the right hand, and curve it between the fingers of the left hand, gently insert the hand and impale the hook into one of those locations that we mentioned.
Until it reaches an empty space, then insert another or a third hook opposite it, if needed, to ensure an equal pull and prevent tilting.  Then, the pulling should be even and not just straight, but also moving in all directions.
To facilitate its exit, as is done with a tooth during extraction.  And in between these actions, the pull should be relaxed if it becomes obstructed on one side. Then the midwife should anoint some fingers with ointment, and insert them to rotate whatever is obstructing it. If some part of the fetus comes out, then reposition the hooks to other locations.
She should slightly raise it to do this until the entire fetus comes out. If a hand comes out before the rest and cannot be pushed back due to constriction, it should be wrapped in a cloth and pulled until the whole body is out, and then cut it off.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.  Likewise, this should be done for the other hand and feet. If the fetus's head is large and experiences pressure during its exit, or if there is accumulated fluid in the head, one should insert a pointed scalpel between the fingers.
With it, one should split the head to remove the fluid, or crush it with the instrument called *al-mashdakh*, the image of which will be shown with the images of other instruments in the next chapter.
Similarly, if the fetus has a large head by nature, one should split the skull or crush it with the *mashdakh*, as mentioned before. Then, the bones are removed with forceps. If the head emerges and becomes constricted at the collarbone, one should split it open so that the moisture in the chest drains out.
Then the chest will adhere. If the chest does not adhere and cannot be extracted, cut as much as possible.  If the lower abdomen is swollen or contains a lump, one should lance it to drain the moisture.
If the fetus is on its feet, pulling it and guiding it to the mouth of the uterus is easy.  If it is constricted at the abdomen or chest, one should pull it with a cloth wrapped around the hand and cut the abdomen or chest to drain what is within.
If all the other organs have been removed and the head remains trapped, let the midwife insert her left hand.  If the mouth of the uterus is open, insert the hand into the cervix, locate the head, and pull it with the fingers towards the mouth of the uterus.  Then, insert a hook or two hooks and pull it out with them.
If the mouth of the uterus has closed due to a hot, inflamed tumor, one should not be forceful. Instead, one should use applications of oily, moist substances, use compresses, and sit in relaxing and moistening waters.
If the fetus is on its side, if it can be positioned, use the methods mentioned for a living fetus.  If this is not possible, cut and remove it.  Absolutely nothing of the placenta should be left inside.  Once you have finished your treatment, use the methods we previously described for hot tumors that appear in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, sit in constricting water and use other treatments.  I have witnessed a woman who became pregnant, the fetus died in her womb, and she subsequently became pregnant again.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a tumor appeared in her abdomen, swelling until it opened and discharged pus.  I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time.  The wound did not heal, so I applied some strong, drawing ointments to it.
A bone then emerged from the area, and after a few days another bone came out.  I was surprised by this, as the abdomen is not a location where bones are found. I concluded that these were bones from the deceased fetus. I probed the wound and removed many bones from the fetus's head.
I continued this procedure until I removed many bones, and the woman was in the best of health. She lived like this for a time, with a small amount of pus continuing to discharge from the area. I have presented this unusual case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts to achieve by hand in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
It contains images of the instruments needed for removing the fetus.
Image of a spiral for opening the cervix.
This binder, with which books are bound, has two spirals at the ends of the planks, but this spiral should be gentler than the binder, and should be either ebony or boxwood. The width of each plank should be the thickness of two fingers.
Their edges are about a finger's width, and their length is a and a half spans. In the middle of the planks are two rods made of the same wood as the planks, secured in them, with a length of half a span or a little more, and a width of about two fingers or a little more.  These two rods.
They are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you turn the spirals.  Image of another tool like this, gentler and lighter.
Made from ebony or boxwood, in the shape of tongs, but with two rods at the end, as you see. The length of each rod is approximately one span, and their width is two fingers. If you want to open the cervix with it...
Then, seat the woman on a bed, with her legs spread apart, and insert these two rods, together, into the cervix.  While holding the end of the instrument between her thighs, then open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with tongs, to the desired degree of cervical opening. So that the midwife accomplishes what she desires.  Image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument that pushes out the fetus.
Image of the instrument used to rotate the fetal head.
It resembles scissors, having teeth at the end, as you see. It can also be shaped like tongs, with saw-like teeth to cut and tear, as you see.
Image of a device (or instrument) as well.
Image of a hook.
This hook has some thickness so it will not break when pulling the fetus, an image of a two-pronged hook.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these tools, the more varied their types and the more prepared the craftsman is, the faster his work and the greater his reputation among people. Do not undervalue any tool, for you may need it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In removing the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, the woman should be told to hold herself, then be made to sneeze with a censer, and you should press your hand over her mouth and nostrils.  If it comes out this way, do so. Otherwise, take a certain amount.
Pierce a hole in the cover, place in it herbs that open the cervix, such as fennel, rue, dill, chamomile, chamomile, rue, and centaury, all or some of these medicines.  Soak them in water, and place the container over the fire.  Then place a silver tube over the hole in the cover, and the other end in the mouth of the uterus.
Hold it until the vapor reaches the bottom of the uterus, then make her sneeze, as we said.  Then the placenta will come out quickly.  If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in deer's fat or the saliva of a rhinoceros.
Then she inserts it into the vagina and searches for the placenta.  If she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out slowly, little by little.  If it is stuck deep within the uterus, insert the hand as described until the placenta is located and pull it out gently, little by little, with care.
So that the uterus does not fall when pulled too hard, rather it should be gently moved to the sides, right and left.  Then the amount of pulling can be increased.  Then it will respond and detach from the adhesion.  If the cervix is closed, we have already described the treatment with sneezing, the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, avoid force when pulling it again.  Instead, tie what has come out to the woman's thigh, near the opening of the uterus. Then inject her with the four-ingredient ointment, for it will cause it to fester after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out.  However, if it festers, a foul odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, harming the patient.  Therefore, suitable incense should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients have tried incense of frankincense and dried figs; the image of the device used to fumigate the woman when menses and the placenta are retained, and similar situations.
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or made of copper. The narrow end is placed at the vulva, and the wider end is placed on the fire. Incense is placed on the embers, held until it is gone, and then replaced with more.
The seventy-ninth chapter.
In treating the unperforated rectum.
Many boys may be born with unperforated rectums, blocked by thin peritoneum.  The midwife should pierce this peritoneum with her finger, or otherwise incise it with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to touch the muscle.
Then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, and treat with ointments until healed. If you fear that it will close again, insert a lead tube into the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
The rectum may also be blocked by a scar or a tumor.  One should incise the scar tissue, and then treat it with the remedies mentioned before and cauterize it.
Eighty-eighth Chapter.
On the treatment of warts that occur on the lower parts of the body.
Warts that occur on the lower parts are a thickening and hardening that develops near the anus, either externally or in the space on one side, and may be one or more in number.
If this thickening persists, it may open and discharge a whitish watery fluid or thin pus.  Some of these warts may penetrate to the rectum and intestines.  Those that do not penetrate are identified by what is discharged through the stool and flatus when the patient uses the restroom.
Sometimes worms may be discharged from them.  Some warts, if located in the space and penetrating the bladder or urethra, might be found; others might penetrate the hip joint or the sacrum.  Warts that penetrate the anus can be identified in the same way as non-penetrating ones.
Insert your index finger into the anus and introduce a thin probe of copper or iron into the wart.  If there is no deviation in the wart, proceed.  If there is a deviation, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair in your finger.  If you feel nothing at all, and no stool, flatus, or worms emerge from the opening, as we said, then know it is not penetrating.  Proceed to treatment.
If the wart penetrates the bladder or urethra, its sign is the discharge of urine from it and the inability of the affected area to heal with medications. If it penetrates the hip joint or sacrum, the sign is the probe reaching those areas.
If there is no deviation towards the bone, and pain is localized to one side, and pus continuously emerges, and if treatment is ineffective and the wound does not heal with ointment, these penetrating warts have no cure at all.
Treatment is a futile effort for those ignorant physicians who attempt it.  However, for those warts that are not penetrating and not chronic, healing is expected with iron, as I describe and have experienced.  The patient should lie on their back before you.
Raise the patient's legs upward, with the thighs tilted toward the abdomen.  Then, if the wart has a deviation, insert the copper or lead probe until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the buttocks, you should then insert your index finger into the buttock.
If you feel the probe has penetrated your finger, exposed without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and the probe, then know for certain that it is penetrating. Do not expend effort on it, for there is no cure, as we have said.
Some claim that it heals in rare cases.  A treatment that might be helpful is to heat a thin cautery iron, according to the size of the wart, as previously mentioned.  Insert the heated iron into the wart until it reaches the area near the buttock, then repeat this two or three times.
So that you know that all excess, clotted flesh, resembling a bird's quill, has been burned.  Then treat it with a flax thread soaked in clarified butter to remove the burned flesh, and then treat it with healing salves, if it heals.
Otherwise, it will not heal with any other treatment.  If you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger in the buttock, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the wart below the skin surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the wart. As you pass the incision with the probe, while it is in the wart, until the incision reaches where the end of the probe ends, and the probe is removed and falls out.  Then cleanse the clotted flesh, which resembles a bird's feather shaft, and leave nothing of it.
Then treat it with healing salves until it heals. If blood obstructs your work in cutting away the flesh, the best and quickest remedy is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good effects: burning the excess flesh.
And stop the bleeding, and dry the moisture, then treat it with a thread soaked in clarified butter or powdered sulfur mixed with oil, so that the area becomes purulent and the burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing salves that promote the growth of firm flesh.
These are the medicines that cause constriction and drying.  If it is set right, it has healed, and do not return to it. If the wart has reached deep into the buttock and is far from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the buttock and search with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it a membrane or flesh, and it is close to penetrating, then there is no way to work on it except through hope and expectation.  That is to use one of three methods: either cauterize it, as we said.
Or to cut it open until you reach its bottom so that you can insert the thread and treatment from near.  Do not continue the incision too far lest you sever the muscle surrounding the buttock, causing the patient to involuntarily pass stool.  Then treat it as we mentioned, and perhaps it will heal, as we said.
Or to pierce that membrane and puncture it after cutting it open to near the buttock, as we said, either with a probe or another sharp-pointed instrument. Then, remove all the hardened flesh that is in the incision as far as you can.
Then sew up the entire wound, including the incision and the upper opening, until it is closed, leaving the wart open inside the buttock, which will be less burdensome on the patient.  The wart may heal in this manner.
If, when inserting the probe into the wart and it is on the side of the buttock, near the body surface, with skin and the buttock's circumference, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a shoemaker's awl in this manner:
And insert a twisted thread of five threads or so into it.  Then, insert the probe with the thread into the wart until it reaches its bottom. If it is punctured in the margin of the buttock from the inside, close by.
Then pull the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the buttock and pulling out the end of the thread.  Tie both ends together firmly and leave it for a day or two.  Whenever the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads breaks and falls away.  Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the wart is not punctured, puncture it as best you can, except if it is very deep, in which case you must not do this due to the muscle, lest you cut it. Then, do with it as we described until it heals.
The shape of the lancet's spine, with which you puncture warts, should have a very sharp curve on one side and a blunt side on the other, so that you do not cut what is unnecessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-one.
Concerning anal fissures that bleed and their incision and treatment.
Hemorrhoids come in two types: either they are within the anus, resembling red blisters or like grapes, and they are small or large, and blood constantly flows from them.
They may be single or multiple, and some are external, at the edges of the anus. However, those that are external are usually less moist, dripping yellow water or a small amount of blood constantly, and are the color of the body.
The treatment for those within the anus is to instruct the patient to defecate and strain until the anus is stretched and the polyps are exposed. Then quickly grasp them with forceps or your fingernail and cut them at their roots. If the forceps do not hold them due to their moisture and looseness,
Then grab it with a rough cloth or a piece of sharpened wood, or pull it with your fingers, and cut it. Then, after cutting, sprinkle some sharp powders on it to act as cautery, or cauterize it as described in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with other remedies until it heals.  If the anus does not come out, administer an enema to the patient with a small amount of irritant to wash out what is in the anus and cause it to come out quickly when the patient strains.  As for polyps outside the anus, their treatment is easy and simple.
To treat them, grasp them with your fingernail or forceps and cut them. Then treat them with the methods mentioned until they heal.  If cutting with metal is undesirable, then it is appropriate to use a perforation method.  Take a twisted thread and thread it through a needle.
Then pull the polyp upward, and pierce it with the needle at its root from the other side. Wrap the ends of the thread under the needle which is positioned across it, and pull the polyp firmly. Tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the polyps, leaving one unpierced.
To cause blood to flow from it, then place a cloth soaked in rose or cypress oil on the anus.  Have the patient rest, and leave it until the polyps fall off.  If the polyps fall off, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they heal.
As for treating fissures, they frequently arise from dryness, accumulation of waste matter, or impacted humors.  If they persist and are not helped by treatment, it is necessary to scrape them with a scalpel or your fingernail until they become moist and the upper crust that prevents adhesion disappears.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more forcefully than before until it bleeds well and the skin is peeled off. Then treat it, and it will heal.

On the treatment of ingrown nails, both ingrown and non-ingrown, dry warts, and the pimple.
A corn is a rounded, flesh-colored nodule, resembling the head of a nail, that appears throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, causing pain when walking.
One should dissect the area around the corn, grasp it with a lancet or a hook, and pull it out from its root. Then treat it. Or if you prefer, cauterize it as described in the relevant section.  As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, hardened, round protrusion on the surface of the body.
They often appear on children's hands.  Treatment is to enlarge the wart and cut it or pierce it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off.  Or, if you wish, cauterize it as before with fire or a sharp medicine.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts can be removed with the instrument mentioned in the treatment of the pimple.  A pimple is also a small, hardened, thick protrusion on the skin, deep-seated.  If exposed to cold, a sensation similar to the sting of ants is felt.
It appears throughout the body, but most often on the hands.  Treatment involves taking a tube of strong goose or eagle feather and placing it around the pimple so that the tube encircles it completely. Then, rotate your hand with the tube until it breaks the skin surrounding the pimple.
And place it deep within the flesh, and the pimple is pulled out from its root.  Or, if you wish, do this with a brass or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube should be solid and twisted, to allow the fingers to grip and turn it easily.  Or, if you wish, cauterize the pimple as described previously in the section on cauterizing warts.

Images of instruments used for injections in conditions of the rectum, diarrhea, and colic.
The enema syringe may be made of silver, or of china, or of hollow or hammered copper.  Small and large versions of this instrument can be made, depending on the users. Those used to treat young children or those with narrow or painful rectums should be very delicate.  Image of a large enema syringe:.
The upper funnel, where the bag is attached, should be wide in this manner, having a partition where the bag is attached, as you see.  The lower end, which enters the rectum, should be very smooth and tight, with two small holes on one side and a single hole on the other.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a reed, or slightly thicker. The bag for holding the medications, made of an animal's bladder or a sheep's intestine, should be shaped like a small plate, with a diameter of a span.
Many holes are pierced in it, in a circular pattern, with the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger.  Then a strong thread made of doubled thread, of ten or so strands, is inserted into these holes, and the bag is gathered together like a plate. Once the medicine is inside, the top of the syringe should be tightly squeezed between the stones, then it is used to administer the enema.  This is an image of the bag and the holes:.
The method for administering the enema is to fill the bag or bladder with the medication, warmed to the patient's tolerance.  Be careful not to use a medication that is too hot or too cold. The patient should lie on their back with their legs raised.
A mat or blanket is placed beneath the patient.  The tip of the syringe is smeared with ointment, egg white, or licorice juice, or similar.  Then, it is gently inserted into the anus.  The attendant holding the bag should squeeze it firmly with both hands until all the contents of the syringe have emptied into the intestines.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient lowers their legs. If the medicine stimulates expulsion, the patient should hold it back as much as possible.  If they sleep with it in all night, it will be more effective in alleviating the ailment.  If the enema is used for diarrheal conditions and the expulsion is hastened, repeat the enema until the patient is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the anus, the syringe should be extremely gentle, smoother than the syringes used for children.  This is an image of a gentle, smooth-skinned syringe:.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
On the treatment of wounds.
I have previously discussed the treatment of conditions similar to burns in the classification.  Here, I will discuss their treatment with the hands and medicines in detail.  I say that wounds differ according to the object that causes the wound and according to the location of the wound.
The objects causing wounds are numerous, such as blows from a stone, cuts from a sword or knife, stab wounds from a spear, stick, or arrow, and similar numerous objects.
And as for wounds according to locations on the body, they are like wounds that occur on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and similar organs.
I will describe the treatment of some wounds to make them a standard and rule for all wounds. I will begin with simple head wounds, especially because the compound ones will be mentioned in the first chapter of the third book of this book.
I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head, and it is not a bone fracture, then if it was caused by a blow from a stone or similar, and only the skin was bruised, and the wound was large, and you feared the occurrence of a hot swelling, then immediately lance the scalp at the site. Do not delay this, and draw blood from him according to his strength, unless there is a reason to prevent the lancing, especially if the blood coming from the wound is little.  Let the lancing be from the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinks, and thick foods. If there is a reason to prevent lancing, then reduce the food, avoid meat and drinks.  If a hot swelling occurs, apply a linen cloth dipped in rose oil, alone or with a drink that has a binding effect, to the wound.
If you are not concerned about a hot swelling, apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and the air has not altered it (the air-alteration I will describe to you shortly), some ointments, if the air has altered it.
Until pus is produced, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and caused by a sword or similar, and its edges have not come together through natural healing, bring them together with stitches, as I will describe in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging, and its attachment is only in a slight area, then cut it away. Then treat the wound with medications to build strong flesh in place of the skin. Instruct the patient to eat strengthening foods, such as heads and tails, and similar foods.
If the skin develops gangrene, and it is not attached to the bone, cut away all the gangrenous tissue and discard it. Then treat it. If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding, and the bleeding does not stop with medicines, then locate the artery.
If you strike it and it does not stop, cut it with the scalpel and tie it off. If the previously mentioned methods are ineffective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops.  If these wounds are small and uncomplicated, their treatment is easily accomplished simply by applying this powder while the wound is still bleeding.
Before the air changes it, the recipe for the powder is: one part frankincense, two parts cinnamon, and three parts slaked or un-slaked lime.  Grind all of these together, sieve them, and fill the wound with it, securing it firmly so that it adheres well.
It will clot with blood, then it should be secured from above with bandages.  Do not remove it as long as it does not swell.  The medicine will not be removed until it heals.  Lime alone can sometimes achieve this effect if frankincense and cinnamon are unavailable.
This can also be done with the lime in many large wounds, if it is carefully applied and secured.  This works for wounds that are fresh with blood, as long as the air has not changed them. However, if the air has altered the wound somewhat, especially during the summer.
There is no effective treatment in applying this powder.  Instead, treat it with some ripening ointments, or apply a poultice of barley flour mixed with water and honey to encourage the pus to drain. Then treat with other remedies until healed.
If a minor bone fracture occurs in the wound, remove it with a cloth.  The treatment of skull fractures is mentioned elsewhere, in the section on neck injuries.  If the wound is in the neck, there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple head wound.
If a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it's a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treatments that cause strong constriction, such as verdigris, alum, and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause spasms.
Never apply anything cold to the wound, because the nerve's essence is cold, and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs. Use gentle remedies such as washed rose petals, repeatedly moistened with fresh water or oil, or rose ointment and zinc oxide.
If washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this way, and with moist poultices.  If the wound is large, use stitches or bring the edges together with splints, then treat until healed.
If the wound has a cavity and pus has collected at the bottom, drain it at the lowest point. If an artery has been severed in the wound and you see blood flowing, tie it off or cauterize it, if necessary.
If some or all of the cartilages of the larynx are severed, but the vessels are intact, stitch the skin edges together around the larynx. Do not touch the larynx itself, but smooth and restore it to its natural shape, then firmly bind it and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with astringent and drying ointments until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, explore it. If there are fragments of bone, remove them all or as many as possible. If not all can be removed, leave it until the wound becomes necrotic and heals, making removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the powder we described.  If bone in the wound becomes necrotic and forms an abscess, treat it as described in the section on chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife, and you see a cavity, observe if air is expelled when the patient breathes. If so, know that it is a fatal wound. If it has no cavity and is fresh with blood, do not immediately apply the powder nor tighten it, lest the blood be trapped in the cavity.
It may recede to the heart and kill the patient. However, apply a drawing ointment twice a day. If ointment is unavailable, place a worn linen pad in the wound to absorb the moisture, and let the patient sleep with the wound uppermost.
To drain what collects there.  If three days or more have passed, and the patient shows no spasms, poor palpitations, or shortness of breath, and you find all other conditions good, know the wound is sound. Treat it with bandages and other therapies until it heals.
If the wound fails to heal and suppuration persists, know it has become an abscess. Treat it as such.  The patient should lie on their wound to drain what collects there.  If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it with the stitching described earlier.
If large, or with the powder if small, and if it has affected the bone, breaking off fragments, then probe the wound and remove those fragments if they are loose. If not loose, leave them.
The wound will fester, then they will be easier to remove.  As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment is governed by the principles we have described.
Chapter Eighty-five.
On wounds of the abdomen, the expulsion of intestines, and their suturing.
A wound appearing in the abdomen may be large, small, or medium. A large wound may expose intestines, or several intestines, making their replacement and suturing more difficult and arduous.
A small wound, too, may present difficulties in another way, making its repair more challenging.  If the intestines are not returned to their place promptly, they swell and thicken, making their replacement more difficult.  For this reason, the most favorable wound is the medium one, as it does not present the same difficulty in returning the intestines as the other two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen can be done in four ways. Two of the methods are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and other bodily wounds. The other two are specific, applying to all wounds but especially suited to suturing the abdomen.
I will describe them to you one by one, with explanation. If the wound is small and something of the intestines protrudes, and its return is difficult, it is due to one of two reasons: either the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestines were previously inflated by a cold air.
If this is the case, you should warm it by dipping a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water, alone or with cooked herbs such as izhkhur, sa'di, and sanbal, and applying it to the intestines until the swelling subsides.
A drink with a binding quality may also achieve this, and is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.  If you see the swelling subside, moisten the intestines with water in which khitmi or khabazi herbs have been cooked; this will facilitate their easier return.
If, after this treatment, the intestines still do not return, make a small incision in the wound using the instrument used for lancing abscesses.  The initial treatment, if successful, is preferable to incision.  Incision is only resorted to after necessity and the failure of other remedies.  Here is a depiction of the instrument.
Its one curved side is limited, the other side unlimited. The thin end is not as thin as a scalpel, but slightly blunt, resembling a small, narrow knife, as you see.  If the wound is wide and the intestines have entered, the intestines should be returned to their natural position.
Its specific location, if possible, is preferable. However, if the wound is large and located in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs elevated higher than their head. If it is located in the upper abdomen, the head and chest should be raised higher than the lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is in one side of the abdomen, always aim to keep the side with the wound elevated higher than the other. This approach should also be used in major and minor surgical procedures.
For minor surgeries, position the patient as best as possible. Then, have a helpful attendant hold the entire wound with both hands, bringing the edges together, and gradually exposing portions to the surgeon.
This is a common method for suturing: Take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound. Leave an area equal to the thickness of the little finger at the edge of the wound and pierce a single needle into both skin edges without thread. Piercing through the skin's edge and the underlying peritoneum from the inside. This brings the skin and peritoneum edges together, forming four layers.  Then, use a double-threaded needle and wrap the thread around the needle multiple times on both sides to firmly close the wound edges.
Then leave an area equal to the finger's thickness and insert another needle.  Tie it off with the thread, as you did with the first needle. Continue this process with as many needles as needed to close the entire wound.  Use needles of medium thickness.
Because very thin needles quickly cut through the flesh, and thick needles are difficult to insert into the skin, the needles should be of medium thickness.  Also, the needle should not be inserted too close to the edge of the skin.
To prevent the flesh from tearing quickly and the wound from reopening before healing, do not pull the stitches too tight, so as not to prevent the wound from healing.  Then, cut the needle points to avoid injuring the patient while sleeping.  Use linen strips on each side of the needles to secure them.
Leave them until you know the wound is healed. This type of stitching with needles is most suitable for minor surgeries, as one or two needles may suffice.
For the general method of stitching, gather the four edges—that is, the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum—all at once with a needle carrying a thread of moderate thickness.  Then, after the needle has traversed all four edges, return the needle to the starting point.
The thread will be interwoven from above the wound, creating stitches similar to those used for securing containers.  Leave a space between each stitch the width of a little finger.  This is a stitch known to everyone.
With this stitch, a surgical procedure was performed on a man who had a knife wound to his abdomen.  The surgical opening was more than a span in width, and nearly two spans of the small intestine had protruded through the opening in the middle of his abdomen.
He returned the intestines after they had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and he was treated until he recovered.  He lived many years afterward, functioning normally.  Doctors had previously deemed him incurable.
Surprisingly, I did not treat it with ointment, as I was in a place lacking medicine. Instead, I placed used cotton on the wound twice daily and ensured it was washed with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the specific types of stitches, I mention it in accordance with Galen's writings: begin the stitching from the skin, inserting the needle from outside to inside.  Once the needle penetrates the skin and the muscle extending straight along the length of the abdomen.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle.  Then insert the needle into its opposite edge from inside to out, at the edge of the peritoneum.  If you insert it there, insert it again into the same edge of the peritoneum from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side and insert the needle into its other edge, from inside to outside.  While inserting it into the peritoneum, also insert it into the edge of the peritoneum on that side, until it passes completely through.
Then, starting from the same side again, trace along the edge of the peritoneum on the opposite side, and bring the needle out of the skin nearby, then return it into that skin, and trace along the edge of the peritoneum on the opposite side with this edge of the peritoneum.
Bring it out of the skin on its side, and do this again and again until you stitch the entire surgical wound in this manner.  The general description of this stitching is that it should be like the stitching used by furriers for furs.
By stitching the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin and leaving it once from the other side until it is empty.  The second type of specific stitching, which Galen also mentioned, is his words verbatim.
It is to stitch it in the manner that some healers stitch, by bringing each part to its corresponding part, naturally, by bringing the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge.  This is as I describe to you.
The needle should be inserted into the edge of the peritoneum closest to you from the outside, penetrating it inward alone, and leaving the edges of the peritoneum. Then, the needle should be withdrawn and inserted from the outside to the inside of both edges of the peritoneum, and then withdrawn again.
And penetrate it from inside to outside in the edge of the peritoneum on the other side.  This type of stitching is better than the general, simple stitching previously mentioned. This is Galen's statement verbatim. Some have said that abdominal stitching may be accomplished with two needles. That is, inserting a single thread into both, beginning by inserting the needle from your side and penetrating to the other side, and inserting the other needle from the opposite side, penetrating from your side, according to the stitching of the saqqafa (leatherworkers) equally.
Know that a rupture in the middle of the abdomen is more difficult to stitch than other parts of the abdomen.  As for treating the wound, its treatment is like other wounds. If you encounter the wound fresh with its blood, before air has altered it, and you have returned the intestines to their proper places and stitched and secured them, then apply the medicated poultice.
If the wound has been altered by air, apply some of the ointments available until it suppurates, the sutures come out, and the peritoneum and peritoneum are joined together.  Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals.
If no remedies are available, apply a piece of worn-out cotton as soon as suppuration begins, and change it twice a day, as I instructed you, until it heals.  If the wounds are minor, you generally do not need further treatment. However, if you fear the wound might cause pain in major organs.
Therefore, dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpits.  If he feels pain or a foul odor in his bowels, which often occurs, then irrigate with a lukewarm, dark, astringent liquid.
Especially if the foul odor has reached the intestines and has become a penetrating wound into the abdomen. Know that the thicker portions of the intestines are easier to heal than the thinner parts.
The jejunum, however, does not heal from any wound that occurs in it, because of its many large blood vessels, its thin structure, and its proximity to the nerves.  If the extruded intestinal tissue is fresh, return it to its place as you would do for the other intestines.
If a period of time has passed and the extruded tissue has turned green or black, it should be tied off with thread above the blackened area to prevent bleeding, as the extruded tissue contains blood vessels and arteries.  Then cut what is below the ligature.
Tie the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound opening so that it is easy to pull it out when the extruded tissue falls away and the wound becomes suppurated.  Description of a wound that occurs in the intestines.  Now, if a small perforation occurs in the intestines...
Sometimes a person can be cured, for I have seen a man who had a wound in his abdomen from a spear thrust, to the right of the stomach. The wound persisted and became a fistula, discharging feces and air.  I treated him, though I had little hope of a cure. I continued to treat him until he recovered and the area healed.  After seeing the area healed, I feared that the patient might experience a bad event in his abdomen, but he experienced no such problem and remained in the best of health. Indeed, he ate, drank, had intercourse, bathed, and exercised, serving him. Some experienced practitioners have stated that if a small wound occurs in the intestines, it should be treated in this manner.
Take large ants by the head, then bring the edges of the wound together. Place one ant, its mouth open, on the wound edges. When it closes and bites, sever its head. It will adhere and not separate. Then place another ant near the first one.
Continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then close and stitch the wound. Those heads remain stuck to the intestines until the intestines heal and the patient recovers completely without any complications. The intestines can also be stitched with thin thread.
To extract the animal adhesive from the Egyptian adhesive, one takes the end of this thread from the adhesive, and unties it. Then, a thin, spun linen thread is tied to its end, and that thread is then inserted into the needle. The Egyptian adhesive thread is used to stitch the intestines, then returned to the cavity.  This type of stitching, with ants and Egyptian adhesive, is only a matter of hope and expectation.
If the rupture is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy and no cure at all.
Chapter Eighty-six.
On the treatment of colds and rhinitis.
Know that any wound or tumor, if it becomes chronic, old, and ulcerated, and if it constantly discharges pus without stopping, is called, in general, in any organ, a fistula or a cold sore, and we call it a cold sore, or fistula.
It is, in fact, a hard, dense, white mass without pain, with a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some called it a feather.  Sometimes it is moist, continually discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture may stop.  This moisture may be abundant, or scant, thick, or thin.
I previously stated in the classification of surgical cases that any ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow is due to one of nine causes; one of them is either due to the lack of blood in the body, or its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its edges preventing the growth of good flesh. Or, it is due to its severe damage and dirt; or because the ulcer itself is foul, and the matter discharging from it is of poor quality; or because the treatment is inappropriate; or because a general disease has affected the town; or due to a local malady.
Or, it is due to its severe damage and dirt; or because the ulcer itself is foul, and the matter discharging from it is of poor quality; or because the treatment is inappropriate; or because a general disease has affected the town; or due to a local malady. As was observed in the city of Saragossa, where the ripening of diseases is difficult, and the healing of tumors is slow naturally; or because it contains one or more bones.  All these causes, their signs, and treatments with remedies have been explained in the classification.
Here, I must introduce you to the treatment of boils and nasal discharge, which is done by hand.  Know that boils can occur in all parts of the body, some leading to large veins and arteries, or to nerves.
or to the peritoneum, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of many complex joints like the hand and foot.  And some lead to the vicinity of a major organ and the like.
Those boils of this nature are difficult to heal, do not respond to treatment, and working on them is arduous and fruitless.  If there are boils that have not reached these mentioned locations, and you hope and expect to treat them...
If you want to find this out, take a probe of copper or iron.  If the boil runs straight, probe it with that. If the boil has a curve, probe it with a thin lead probe, for lead is soft.
It will slide when entering and turn toward the curve.  If the boil has many openings that you cannot detect with a probe, then inject one of its openings.  The moisture you inject will travel to the other openings and flow out.
Then, continue your search in any way possible to determine if there is a bone or nerve, whether the bottom of the boil is deep or close to the surface, or if it is a single boil with many openings.  Understand all this to the best of your ability, based on careful observation and the pain felt when touching the area.
And in a similar manner from the signs and causes of the swelling.  If you have truly ascertained all of this, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  Look, if...
If the boil is superficial, close to the surface, or in a healthy area far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the locations I have mentioned, then, as described previously, incise the boil and remove the hardened tissue, the corrupted flesh, and the excess flesh.
And treat any flesh or warts that grow in its opening, until it heals.  If the boil is deep and straight, you should incise it as deeply as possible and then clean it of all its corrupted flesh.
Then, use a twisted, medicated cloth soaked in strong medicine and insert it into the bottom of the boil, which you locate with the instrument.  Do this repeatedly until the strong medicine consumes all remaining corruption at the base of the boil.
Then, treat it with ointments that promote healthy flesh growth until it heals.  If it does not heal with that, cauterize it as previously described.  If the cause of the boil is bone, and you are sure of this, probe and incise it as I told you, unless something prevents you from doing so.
Or a vein, nerve, or vital organ, as we said.  If the bone is exposed to you and it has some corruption and blackness, remove the corruption until it is gone, then treat it with something that will heal it until it is cured. If it does not heal and the pus continues as before.
Know that you have not reached complete removal of the corruption.  Expose all of it again, thoroughly remove and cleanse it with your utmost effort, then treat it.  If it heals, well and good.  Otherwise, know that the corruption is in a deep, hidden place.  Expose all of it again.
Thoroughly remove and cleanse it with your utmost effort. If the corrupted bone is small and you can pull it out, pull it out with the finest forceps suitable for that.
If there are many bones, thoroughly remove them all, leaving nothing behind.  If you encounter ligaments that obstruct them, and cutting them poses no risk, cut those ligaments and any flesh present, and free the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones in your time, apply something that will rot the wound and leave it for a number of days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones rot. Protect the wound, so that the opening you created during your work does not heal.
But if you fear this, apply a cotton ball soaked in powdered sulfur and oil, or a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian ointment, or one of the green ointments.  If these ligaments rot and the bones become loose, it will be easy to extract and pull them out.
If it is a single large bone, like a leg bone or thigh bone, and only its surface has become corrupted, thoroughly clean it until the blackness and corruption are gone, and then close the wound.  If a large part has become corrupted, and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, it is necessary to break it up.
Cut it all the way to where the corruption ends.  Then treat it until it heals.  I tell you about a case of a young man with a disease in his leg to use as an example and aid in your treatment.
Around thirty years ago, he developed pain in his leg due to material moving from inside the body to the leg, swelling into a large tumor.  There was no external cause.  Then, time passed with incorrect treatments by the physicians until the tumor opened.
Much material drained from it, and he was poorly treated, until the leg became diseased and had many openings, all draining pus and bodily fluids.  A group of physicians treated him for about two years, but none of them was skillful in the art of the hand.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg, and large amounts of material were flowing from those openings. The man's body had wasted away, and his color had turned yellow. I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
I found that some of them connected to others from all sides of the leg.  I then cut open one of those openings, exposing some of the bone. I found it corrupted, decayed, blackened, rotten, and perforated, with the hole reaching into the marrow.  I reported what I discovered.
I removed the corrupted bone, and I believe that there was nothing but this corruption that I excised and reported.  Then, I applied healing remedies to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.  I then re-exposed the bone, going beyond the first exposure.
I found the corruption connected to the bone.  I reported what I saw of this corruption as well.  Then, I tried to heal it, but it did not heal or close.  I then exposed it again.  I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and attempt to mend it, but it would not heal, until I had removed about a span of bone.
I removed it with its marrow, and then healed it with remedies. It healed quickly and recovered.  This repeated procedure of cutting and probing was necessary due to the patient's weakness, their limited tolerance, and my fear for their life, as they frequently suffered fainting spells due to excessive vomiting.  They recovered completely.
Firm flesh grew in place of the bone, and their condition in the body improved.  Their strength returned, and they resumed their activities.  No impairment of walking developed that would harm them at all.  If a bone in any part of the body is broken.
Therefore, it is necessary to expose it in this manner: take a bandage and tie it to the protruding end of the bone, and instruct someone to pull it upward. Make another bandage of thicker wool than the first.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone, and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards.  While exposing the flesh in the area you wish to expose, so that the saw does not injure the flesh, place a piece of wood or a plank beneath the bone, securely fastened.
For if you do this, the saw will not fail to cut the corrupted bone.  The incision should be slightly above the area of corruption, so that there is no corruption within the cavity of the bone that is not apparent on the surface, and you are forced to repeat the incision.
If the bone is corrupted but not protruding, and instead the parts are joined together with the corruption within its center or in a part of it, expose the flesh from all sides. Then place the plank beneath, and make the incision from the first side where the corruption is.
When you have finished the first incision, make an incision on the other side.  Let the incision be a short distance from the corruption, as we said.  If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and make an incision on the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but excision.  If the corruption is in the hand or foot, the treatment is very difficult, but you must scrape away the corruption as it appears to you and remove and cleanse it in any way you can.
By whatever means it works for you, as long as you do not encounter a vein or nerve.  And know that there are many saws and blades for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, their structure, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and fragility. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a tool appropriate to each type of work.
Know that the work itself can indicate the type of tool you need, if you have extensive experience and knowledge of the arts of this craft, for a master craftsman who has witnessed many diseases. He may devise tools for himself that are similar to each illness, and I have illustrated tools for you at the end of this chapter.
Make them examples to follow and a basis for measuring others, if God wills.  Image of a saw:.

Chapter eighty-seven.
In the amputation of limbs and the spreading of bones.
If the limbs become putrid, either from an external or internal cause, and if you treat the putrefaction with medicinal remedies but the treatment is not effective and you see the putrefaction spreading in the limb, unchecked by anything.
Then you should amputate that limb at the point where the putrefaction has reached, so that the patient may be saved from death or a great affliction greater than the loss of the limb.  A sign of this affliction is that the limb will turn black, so that you would think fire had burned it.
Or it may putrefy after turning black, so that this putrefaction spreads to the limb next to it and affects the rest of the body.  Proceed with amputation in this case as well, and similarly if the cause of the putrefaction is from the sting of some venomous creatures, like the sea scorpion, snake, or centipede, and the like.
If the putrefaction or the sting is in the tip of the finger, amputate the finger and do not delay until the putrefaction spreads to the hand.  Likewise, if the putrefaction has reached the hand, amputate it from the base of the forearm and do not delay until the putrefaction spreads to the elbow of the arm.
Likewise, if it has reached the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow, at the joint itself.  If the putrefaction progresses and you see it spreading towards the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder at all, for that would result in the patient's death.  Use other treatments according to your ability.
Likewise, do the same for the leg. If the putrefaction reaches the toe, amputate the toe at one of the joints. If it reaches the foot, amputate the entire leg.  If it ascends to the knee, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
If the putrefaction has reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to leave it and allow the patient to succumb to death. The procedure for amputating or dissecting a limb is to tie a ligature below the location you want to cut and tie another ligature above the location.
One attendant pulls the lower ligature downwards, and another attendant pulls the upper ligature upwards. You then use a broad scalpel to dissect the flesh between the ligatures until all the flesh is exposed. Then, cut or dissect it.  Cotton cloths should be placed on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the correct area and cause the patient excessive pain and a hot swelling.  If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the area quickly or apply some hemostatic material, then return to your treatment until finished.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until healed.  I will tell you about an example of this condition occurring in a man's leg.  It was precisely the same condition as I am describing to you, in that a blackness appeared on his leg accompanied by a burning sensation like fire.
This decay initially occurred in his finger, eventually affecting his entire foot. The man despaired when he saw the decay spreading through the limb, along with the intense pain and burning.  He cut it off at the joint, and he was cured.
After a long time, this same decay appeared again in his index finger. He came to me, and I applied the remedies I had on hand to the affected hand, after cleaning his body.  But the decay did not recede, and it began to spread to the other finger.
Until the decay spread to his entire hand, and he asked me to amputate his hand.  I refused, hoping to arrest the decay, and also fearing his death from the amputation, because his strength was failing. When he despaired of me, he left for his home.
I was later told that he eventually cut off his entire hand and was cured.  I have related this story to help understand this type of illness, and to serve as a guide.
Eighty-eighth Chapter.
On treating abscesses and how to inject remedies into them.
If a tumor forms in some fleshy organ and persists for a while, then bursts or breaks open, and all the matter within it is discharged, leaving the area empty as a vessel.
The skin over it is like a tattered cloth, thinned out, and not sufficiently corrupt to affect the bone, nerve, or ligament.  For this reason, it is called an abscess, and not a fistula, unless its duration extends so far that the corruption affects one of these structures.
In that case, it is called a fistula or ulcer. Its treatment is to cut away all the skin in a circular manner, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain it does not adhere to the affected area because of its corruption.
If you anticipate the skin might adhere, and the corruption has not reached that extent, and there is thick flesh in the skin, treat it with injections.  Examine the abscess; if it is large and the pus it discharges has a foul odor, inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
This is vinegar, oil, honey, and alum, equal parts, mixed in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens to the consistency of honey. Then, take the amount needed, thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess.  Bind the opening and leave the medicine in place for about two hours.
Then, express it out.  Do this for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.  If this medicine is unavailable, it can be injected with ash water.  Take the ash of the vine tree's wood, or oak wood, and pour water over it.
Then, strain it and inject it until you are certain that the abscess has been washed out.  If the patient is not likely to tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, inject with water and honey mixed with some ground alum.
Or inject with honey and drink mixed together, for honey is capable of cleansing and washing, and the drink adheres to the abscess, especially if the drink has an astringent and drying quality.  If you do this repeatedly and are certain the abscess's corruption is gone, then inject with something that promotes the growth of flesh there.
For example, take some terebinth ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and an astringent drink, or inject with some other ointments and remedies whose properties we have demonstrated in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the abscess is narrow and the injecting tube cannot be inserted,
If the opening is narrow, widen it slightly with an instrument, or place a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or Cerigon ointment within it until it widens.  Similarly, if the opening is wide, bring its edges together by stitching and leave just enough space for the syringe to pass through, but no more.
Also, if the opening from which pus is dripping is elevated, split it at the lowest point so that the pus drains downwards, because if pus is retained in the depths of the abscess, it prevents the flesh from growing there.
If you are unable to split the abscess downwards as desired, then consider positioning the affected part so that pus drains easily, as convenient, and ensure that no pus remains trapped within it at all.
As for the cohesive medicines to be applied to the abscess from the outside, and how to apply them: take one of the cohesive ointments suitable for your purpose, spread it on a linen cloth, and make the cloth large enough to cover the entire abscess. Then, using scissors, cut a hole slightly larger than the abscess opening opposite the abscess mouth.  Spread a soft ointment on another cloth, sized to fit the hole, and place it in a spaced-out manner on top of the hole so that pus can drain out easily. Do not remove the large cloth until later.
For several days, the one over the abscess opening is the one you remove at all times to drain any accumulated pus.  To know if the pus draining is abundant, little, mature, or unripe.
And with this also, examine the location of the abscess itself: does the patient feel pain there, or not? Is there swelling, or not?  If your treatment continues in this manner and you see the material draining from the abscess opening is scant.
Know then that the abscess has adhered or is close to adhering.  In that case, treat it again tomorrow or on the third day.  When you treat the wound, change the cloths and renew the ointment.  If, after a long time, thin pus comes out of the abscess, do not despair of its adhering.
Then its healing is near, because some people have slow wound healing and some have fast.  If, after many days, unripe pus comes out of the abscess, know that the abscess has not adhered. If the abscess adhesion is delayed.
Then increase the drying medicines.  Let the medicines be moist in consistency and dry in strength, such as the palm ointment if more colocynth has been added to it.  The most effective remedy is to use palm ointment.
It is treated by applying rose ointment, and sprinkling moderate-strength, aged wine over it, and then mixing it with it and using it.  A similar method may be used if you do not have palm ointment: honey, boiled until it thickens, may be used; or take myrrh, frankincense, and kender, powder them all, and sprinkle them onto the honey while it is on the fire. Then apply it to a cloth and bind it to the abscess, or apply the boiled, thickened honey, sprinkle the medicaments over it, place cloths on it, and bind it.
Long zera, the root of the asphodel, crushed and sifted carnation flour, and the herb dittany, whether used singly or in combination, can also be used. Powder and sift these, and sprinkle them on the honey that I have described and apply it. If the abscess persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption deep within it.
If it has affected the bones, or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it with the treatment for abscesses as previously described.
Eighty-ninth chapter.
In the treatment of the ingrown toenail, the injured fingernail, the removal of excess finger, and the separation of adhered fingers.
An ingrown toenail is excess flesh that grows under the fingernail of the hand or foot, and possibly on other fingers. If it is allowed to persist and its treatment is neglected, it will swell into a hot tumor.
Or it may fester and become gangrenous, even eating away the nail root and perhaps destroying the entire nail.  The decay may even reach the bone, causing a foul odor, broadening the end of the finger, and making it dark in color.  If you treat it as described in the classification, and your treatment is unsuccessful,
Then it is necessary to cut away all the excess flesh that grows from the nail with a scalpel, then cauterize the wound.  Cauterization is very beneficial in this case.  However, if the bone is healthy and the nail also healthy,
If the nail's corner has pressed the flesh inward, causing it to be pierced and irritated, a thin strip of material should be placed under the corner of the nail that is piercing the flesh, raising it upward, and the flesh should be gently cut away.
Apply cauterizing and corrosive medications to the remaining flesh until it is all gone, then treat with ointments until healed.  If the decay has affected the bone, it is necessary to remove the affected bone, as it will not heal as long as there is diseased bone present.
If you see decay and corruption spreading in the finger, amputate it at one of the phalanges, as previously described, and then treat it until it heals.  If the nail is injured or bruised, causing severe pain, it is necessary to first apply a blood-letting procedure.
Then, using a sharp scalpel, slit the nail with a slanted cut from top to bottom, taking care not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail.  Doing so will cause intense pain in the affected area and create excess tissue growth in the area.  Then treat the area with remedies that relieve pain.
As for the extra finger that sometimes grows in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may contain some bone, or even a nail, with some of its growth arising from the joint of another finger.
Or its growth may be in some of the phalanges of the finger; those growing in the phalanges of the finger will not move.  Those growing at the finger joint might move.  Any that are merely fleshy, are easily severed, by cutting them at their origin with a wide scalpel.
However, those growing at the origin of the joint are difficult to treat and should not be cut;  but those that sprout on a finger at one of the phalanges should first be cut, removing the flesh in a circular fashion towards the bone, and then the bone should be sliced with one of the appropriate saws.
Then treat it until it heals; as for the adhesion that sometimes occurs between fingers, this is quite common, and may be congenital or result from the closing of a wound, burn, or similar injury. It is necessary to separate such adhesions.
So that the fingers return to their natural form, then place between them a piece of cloth or gauze soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly adhere again, or place a thin lead plate between them, until the area heals properly.
Similarly, if adhesion occurs between a finger and the palm, separate the adhesion in a way that best restores the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
In cutting the cords.
The cords are twisted, thick veins filled with dark, black phlegm, which occur in most parts of the body and are most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, laborers and carriers.  First, the body should be thoroughly purged of the black bile through vigorous shaking.
Then, bleed the affected person using a lancet.  Treatment with iron can be of two kinds: one is to cut and remove the black blood, the other is to cut the vein and remove it entirely.  As for cutting, first, the leg should be soaked in hot water, indeed.
Until the thick, murky blood dissolves, then the leg of the patient is tightly bandaged from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage.  Then, the vein is cut in one, or two, or three wide cuts.
Then, remove the black blood from the bottom of the leg to the top, and from the top to the bottom, until you remove the amount of blood you deem sufficient, or what the strength of the patient can tolerate.  Then bandage it and instruct him to avoid foods that produce black bile, and repeat the purging and bleeding.
When the veins become filled and that harms the patient, as for cutting, it should be done in this manner: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair, then have him enter a bath and soak his leg in hot water until it turns red and sweats, or he does a strenuous exercise.
If a bath is not available to heat the limb, then cut the skin lengthwise opposite the vein, either near the knee or below at the heel.  Then open the skin with hooks and scrape the vein from all sides until it is visible to the touch.
When it appears, you will see it red and shiny.  When freed from the skin, it also appears like a tendon.  Then insert a probe underneath it until it rises and emerges from the skin.  Hook it with a smooth, blunt hook. Then cut another incision near that incision, about the width of three fingers.
Then scrape the skin off the vein until it is exposed. Then lift it with the probe as you did before and hook it with another hook, as you did at first. Then cut another incision or many incisions if necessary.
Then cut and sever it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull and cut it until it emerges from the second incision.  Then pull it toward the incision above it. Do this until you pull it out from the third incision above all the others, until when it is all out, then cut it.
If pulling and cutting does not work, insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread, tie it, and pull it. Insert the probe underneath and twist your hand in all directions until it comes out, being careful not to break it, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult to remove.
This causes harm to the patient.  When you have removed it completely, place wool soaked in a drink and rose ointment or oil on the surgical site and treat it until it heals. If the vein is constricted, with twists and turns, curving in directions.
If it is not straight, as we said, you should make an incision on each twist and turn. Then hook it with hooks until you remove it completely. Be careful when making incisions not to cut or injure the vein, as this will make it harder to remove, so exert your effort carefully.
Image of the incision used for the vein.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not have a bend like other hooks, and its tip should not be sharp so as not to injure the vein.  It should be thick and smooth in its bend, because if it is thin, its thinness will cut the vein.  Rather, it should have the advantage of thickness, as we said.
Chapter Ninety-one.
In the vein of the civilian.
This vein arises in the legs in hot countries such as the Hijaz and Arab lands, and in hot, sparsely populated, infertile countries.  It may also arise in other parts of the body besides the legs, arising from festering under the skin.
As it occurs within the bodies of snakes and worms, and the scabs of ulcers, and the worms that develop between the skin and flesh.  A sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a severe burning sensation occurs in the leg, then the area becomes blistered, and then the vein begins to emerge from the site of the blister.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal.  When its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing one to two dirhams, and tied. The lead should be left hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it outward, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it grows extensively, cut off some of it and wrap the remainder. Do not cut it from its source before it has all emerged, for if you cut it, it will shrink and enter the flesh, causing a swelling, festering, and a bad ulcer in the area.
Therefore, it should be treated and pulled out little by little until it emerges completely from the end, leaving nothing of it in the body. In some people, this vein may reach five to ten cubits in length.
I have heard that it has emerged from a man to a length of twenty cubits. If it breaks off during your treatment, insert a sponge into the hole, and press it firmly against the body for a long time until all material inside it is emptied.  Try to heal the area with medicines for a number of days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or the leg itself, creating many openings and branches emerging from each opening. Treat it as described in the classification and as previously mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Concerning the ulcerated worm that grows under the tendon, called the "cow's disease.
This disease is called "cow's disease" in some of our countries because it frequently affects cows.  It is a single, small worm that develops between the skin and flesh and crawls throughout the body, ascending and descending.
Its movement from one part of the body to another is noticeable to the touch, until it pierces the skin at a point where it emerges, forming an ulcer from the putrefaction of some humors, similar to what occurs with worms, snakes, and the disease of the gourd in the abdomen.
However, the danger from it is that if it crawls throughout the body and ascends to the head and reaches the eye, it might break through the eye and emerge, thereby destroying it.  This often happens.  If you want to treat it and remove it, it can only be done when it is crawling and visible to the touch.
Therefore, one should tie tightly around the area above and below it with a strong bandage, then lance it and remove it.  If it has burrowed into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply cauterization to the area with fire until you burn it out.  The greatest danger is its possible damage to the eye, as we mentioned.
If you see it in the head near the eye, tie tightly under it on the forehead, then lance it and remove it.  The patient should also take care to cleanse the body with medications that relieve putrid, poor-quality humors, and to avoid foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-three.
On lancing the disease known as the "naفر".
This disease, called the "naفر" in our country, is a pain that appears in some organs and then moves from one organ to another.  I have seen it as I describe it to you.
I was summoned to a woman suffering in a remote area. She revealed her arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the vein of the arm. After an hour, I saw that swelling crawling along the radius, like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as mercury.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain will subside from that spot and settle in the shoulder. Then, after an hour, it raced throughout the rest of the body until it was in the other arm, and she told me that it was circulating throughout her entire body, as I observed.
I was amazed by the speed of its movement from one organ to another.  Before, I had only heard of this disease moving from one organ to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes like this, in this woman.
I surmised that this was because the woman was from the desert, her body lean and her veins exposed.  Therefore, this moving sensation was more apparent to the senses.  It is likely that this wouldn't appear in the same way in those who live in comfort, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it, and the sufferer feels the pain visibly, as we have described, then apply pressure above and below it quickly, and puncture it until the trapped wind/air emerges and is released from the affected area.
If you do not see it, treat it by shaking the body and remedies that expel or disperse wind, such as rotten-seed and scab-seed and similar medications.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On the removal of arrows.
Arrows vary according to their types and the locations of their impact on the body.  Regarding their variation in types, some are large, some small; some are hollow glass, some solid glass; some have three angles, some four.
Some have tongues, some have shards.  As for their impact on the organs, they fall into two categories: either the organs are major hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, and bladder, and the like. If an arrow strikes one of these organs, and the signs of death that I will describe to you later appear, then you should avoid removing the arrow, for death will befall the person in most cases. But if these unfavorable signs do not appear, and the arrow is not lodged deep within the organ, remove it and treat the wound.  Among the signs of a head injury from an arrow piercing the bone and wounding the membrane covering the brain, there is severe headache, dizziness, and fainting.
But if these unfavorable signs do not appear, and the arrow is not lodged deep within the organ, remove it and treat the wound.  Among the signs of a head injury from an arrow piercing the bone and wounding the membrane covering the brain, there is severe headache, dizziness, and fainting. Redness in the eyes and tongue, spasms, confusion, vomiting, and possibly bleeding from the nostrils or ears; possibly the loss of speech and voice, and the discharge of a white, porridge-like substance from the wound, resembling watery flesh.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not yet been removed.  Now, if the arrow strikes the heart, near the left breast, and it feels as if it has lodged in something solid, not hollow...
The arrow might also move like a pulse, and black blood flows from the wound.  This is followed by coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.  Know then that death is inevitable.  A sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels following the neck swell, the patient's color changes, and he breathes heavily, seeking inhaled cold air.  If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the small ribs, and the breathing will be heavy with severe pain.
He sighs and all the shoulder muscles move. If the arrow strikes the liver, intense pain follows, and blood resembling the liver in color flows from the wound.  If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food might be discharged from the wound.
His condition is obvious. If the arrow strikes the abdomen, pierces it, and something from the bowels, intestines, or anus is discharged from the wound, there is no hope for treatment or removal of the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder, urine will be discharged.
If something protrudes outward and the patient's pain intensifies, know that he is doomed.  As for other organs, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are more likely to survive the event.
Unless the arrow struck an artery or nerve, and was not poisoned, I will tell you some observations of these arrows to help you with treatment.  A man had an arrow strike the root of his nose, piercing his eye.
I extracted an arrow from the opposite side, under the earlobe, and he recovered without eye damage.  I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had lodged in his eye's lower eyelid,  and only the small tip touching the shaft remained.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, with a square, smooth iron head, and no barbs. The Jew recovered without further harm to his eye.  I removed another arrow from a Christian's throat; it was an Arabic arrow.
It had barbs, and I cut between the windpipes, as it was lodged in his throat.  I gently worked it out, and the Christian recovered.  I also removed another arrow from a man's stomach, and we judged he would die from it.
After about thirty days, with no change in his condition, I carefully worked on the arrow and extracted it. He recovered without further incident. I saw a man with an arrow in his back, and the wound had become closed over.
Seven years later, the arrow came out from the base of his thigh.  I saw a woman with an arrow in her stomach; the wound had healed over, and the arrow remained. Her condition did not change, nor did she experience any impairment in her normal activities.
I saw another man with an arrow in his face; the wound had closed, and he felt little pain.  Many such cases exist. I removed an arrow from a sultan's commander who had been struck in the middle of his nose, slightly deviating toward the right side.
The arrow had completely disappeared. I was called to treat him three days after the injury.  I found the arrow wound very small.  I probed it with a fine instrument, but felt nothing.  He was experiencing a prickling and pain under his ear, on the right side.
I hoped that the prickling was the arrowhead, so I applied a dressing with drawing and ripening properties, hoping the area would swell and reveal the arrowhead's location, so I could then open it.  But no sign appeared to indicate the arrow had reached that spot.
I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened.  The wound eventually closed. The patient despaired of extracting the arrow for a long time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. He informed me, and I applied strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it. I felt the thin arrowhead, which was adhering to the nasal bone.  Then I continued to enlarge the opening with that strong medicine until the arrowhead became visible.  This took me about four months.
Then, when the wound widened and I could insert the forceps, I pulled and moved it, but it wouldn't come out. I continued to manipulate it with various instruments until one day I grasped it firmly with the forceps, a description of which is given in the final part of this chapter.
The physicians had judged that his nasal cartilage could not be repaired, but I repaired it. The wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, with no further problems.  I tell you this, to show how some arrows are extracted, as an example and guide for those cases that I have not yet described.
Because the parts and details of this craft cannot be grasped through description or contained within a book.  Instead, the skillful artisan judges the many from the few, the present from the past, and devises a new method and new tools for unusual cases.
If I now turn to this aspect of the craft, I say that arrows are removed from the organs where they lodge in two ways: either by pulling them out from the point of entry, or from the opposite side, the same side from which they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding into the fleshy tissue, and may be pulled out. If it does not come out immediately, you should leave it for a few days, so that the surrounding flesh rots, and extraction becomes easier.  Likewise, if it is lodged in bone.
If it does not come out, leave it for several days and continue pulling and manipulating it daily until it is extracted. If it does not emerge after several days, you should pierce around the arrow in the same bone from every side with a fine awl to enlarge the opening for the arrow, then pull it out.
If the arrow is lodged in the skull bone, deep within one of the brain cavities, and some of the symptoms I have mentioned appear, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it for several days until its condition improves.
Then continue to pull and extract the arrow. If it is deeply embedded and cannot be extracted, use the awls around the arrow as I described before, then treat the affected area until it heals. Now, if the arrow is hidden in a part of the body, and it is hidden from sight, probe with a sounding instrument. If you feel it, pull it out with instruments suitable for the task. If you cannot do so because the wound is narrow and the arrow is deeply embedded, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way,
then widen the wound to gain access to the arrow and remove it. If it has two barbs, grasp them and remove the flesh entangled in each from all sides by whatever method you can.  If you cannot release the flesh, break and twist the barbs until you extract them.
And when trying to remove the arrow in any place, use twisting with forceps in all directions to extract it. Be extremely gentle so the arrow does not break, making extraction more difficult. If you cannot remove it in this time,
leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh rots. Then try again, for it will be easier to remove. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments described in their respective sections.  Be careful not to cut a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use any method possible.
By all means possible, extract the arrow gently, carefully, and firmly as previously described.  When pulling the arrow, the patient's position should return to the position it was in when the arrow was lodged, this is the best approach.
If this is not possible, use whatever form you can.  An arrow protruding from the opposite side either has part of it visible externally, or you can feel the tip of the arrow near the skin surface, protruding.
Cut into it, making the incision just large enough for the forceps to fit. Then pull it out, as this will make removal easier. If it is lodged in bone, twist your hand in a circular motion until the arrow affects the bone and widens a space for itself, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days, then try again until it comes out. If the arrowhead is still attached, push it out with it. If the arrowhead has come loose and you wish to use pushing, insert a hollow instrument into the arrow shaft, so that its cavity fits the shaft end, then push it out with the instrument.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that fits into the hollow, for this will make its removal easier. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize all the affected flesh, if possible, and then treat it with appropriate remedies.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or flank, and is close enough to be probed, and you can make an incision, cut and be careful not to sever a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then stitch the wound if necessary, and treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps used to extract arrows:.
Its tips are like the beak of a bird, crafted as though a file, so that when it grips an arrow or something, it will not release it.  Different sizes, large, small, and medium, are made, depending on the size of the arrow, the size of the wound, and its width.

This one is solid at the tip, like a rod, to easily enter the hollow arrow and push it out.
Chapter Ninety-Five.
In the opening of veins.
The veins customarily opened in the body are thirty. Of these, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the *ḥasīsīn*; the two veins in the temples, visible; and the two veins in the eye sockets, known as the *nāẓirīn*.
And the vein standing in the middle of the forehead, the vein at the tip of the nose, and the two veins in the neck, and the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins in the lower lip, and these veins, known as the *jayārak*, and the two veins under the tongue.
And as for the veins opened in the arm and hand, there are five veins. One of them is the *qayfāl*, which is from the outer side, and the common people call it the vein of the head. And the *akḥal*, which is the middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the *bāsiliq* and a branch of the *qayfāl*, and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the *bāsiliq*, which is located on the inner side, and is also called the *ibṭiyya*, and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen and the cord of the arm. It is located on the *zand* (forearm).  It is the one that adheres to it, and it is the one that appears clearly above the thumb, and the *ʾasīlīm*.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, having two branches.  In the leg and foot, there are three veins: one beneath the bend of the knee on the outer side; the second, the *ṣāfin*, located at the heel on the inner side; and the vein of the *nisā* (women), located at the ankle on the outer side.
And in the other leg, there are three veins similar to them.  As for the two veins behind the ears, their opening benefits chronic colds, migraine, shingles, and chronic, bad head sores; and their method of opening will be described as I state.
This is done by shaving the patient's head and rubbing its back in the location of the veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well. Then the patient's neck is constricted with a turban, so that the veins appear behind the ears in the two depressed areas of the head.  Then, you should probe them with your finger.  Where you feel a pulsation under your finger, mark that spot with ink.
Then, take a scalpel, known as a *nishal*, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone. Then lift your hand, with the vein and skin, upwards, and cut the vein, together with the skin, in a precise cut. The length of the cut should be the length of two clenched fingers.
Or similar.  Release the desired amount of blood, then tie them off with bandages, and leave them until healed.  Their incision and cauterization are mentioned earlier in the book.  As for the arteries in the temples, their opening benefits chronic migraines, severe headaches, chronic eye inflammation, and acute, intense watering of the eyes.
Their method of opening, as I describe to you, is to tie the patient's neck with a turban until the veins become clearly visible, and their pulsation is apparent under your finger.  Then, mark the spots with ink.  Afterwards, lift the skin above the vein with your index finger.
Insert the *nishal* scalpel underneath and lift the vein upwards, and sever it as you did with the other veins.  Release the blood according to your need. Then, loosen the patient's neck constriction and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then, apply a compress and bandage, tying securely from above. Leave it until healed. Their incision, cauterization, and lancing are mentioned previously in the book.  As for opening the forehead vein, its benefit follows the opening of the temporal veins for chronic facial conditions like shingles, sores, and inflamed redness.
The method of opening it, as I describe to you, is to have the patient tie their neck with a turban until the vein is visible.  Then, take the instrument called the *fāʾs* (axe). Here is its picture:.
Place the pointed tip of the axe on the vein. Strike from above with a chisel or similar tool. Allow the blood to flow as desired.  Then, loosen the patient's neck constriction and tie it securely until healed.
It may be opened with a broad scalpel, but the scalpel should not be sharp-pointed like other scalpels.  Rather, it should be slightly broad-bladed and opened against the grain because the bone is close by.  Otherwise, the scalpel might break if it is thin.
As for the veins in the eye sockets, their benefit is for eye ailments like scabies, redness, and discharge, and facial diseases.  As for their opening, the patient should tie their neck with a turban.  Then, open them while standing over their head.  The opening should be done with a small, slightly broad-bladed scalpel, against the grain, slightly lengthwise.
If the area has little flesh, the scalpel may break if its tip is thin.  Then, take the necessary amount of blood, place a bandage over the veins, and tie them tightly for one night.  Then, loosen them.  As for opening the nasal vein, it is helpful for acute fevers.
Severe headaches and facial diseases, such as the red inflammation that appears on the nose, especially if chronic, are treated this way: The patient's neck should be tied.  Then, hold the nose with your left hand and take a long, thin scalpel.
Insert it into the middle of the nostril itself, between the nasal passages, in a straight line, because the vein is not noticeable there. The blood will immediately flow. You should push the scalpel in slightly and take the needed blood, then tie it up for a night.  It will clot quickly.
As for the veins of the armpits, opening them is beneficial for shortness of breath, the beginning of leprosy, and black humoral diseases that appear on the skin's surface, such as black vitiligo, scabies, and foul ulcers and sores.  Their opening is done by tying the patient's neck beneath them with a bandage. The surgeon should stand at the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair.  Then, open a wide but shallow incision along the vein.  Draw off the moderate amount of blood, or as much as needed.  Do the same with the other vein. Then, loosen the bandage.
Tie the two veins with a moderate tightness so that the patient does not suffocate. Leave them until the next day. The wound will heal.  As for the veins of the temples, opening them after opening the cephalic vein is beneficial for mouth sores, gum diseases, foul ulcers, cracked lips, and foul sores.
Which are in the nose and surrounding it.  The method for opening them is to have the patient sit in front of you, and tie their neck with a turban.  Then, turn their lips outward, and look for the two veins, one on the right of the lip, and the other on the left.  Observe their blackness.
Also, there are thin, black veins around them.  Cut these veins completely off.  If it is unclear to you, and you do not know which to take, then aim at cutting the largest and most obvious ones.  Similarly, do the same with the veins in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, opening them after opening the cephalic vein is beneficial for the obstructions that occur in the throat from diseases of the tongue and diseases of the mouth.  The method for opening them is to have the patient sit before you facing the sun, raise their tongue, and look under the tongue on one side and the other, where you will find a vein on each side. Their color is dark.
Open them, but take care not to cut them deeply, as there are arteries beneath them, and bleeding from these arteries may occur. The three veins that are opened at the elbow are the ones that have been customarily opened in all people. Their opening is in two ways.
Either with a wide, fennel-shaped lancet, or an olive-shaped lancet, to the point of softness; or with a lancet knife, which is a puncture [and this is its image]. Image of the wide fennel-shaped lancet:
It should be wide, as you see, to be suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, obvious, thick veins that contain thick, dark blood.  And this is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:
This lancet is narrower and has a finer tip, suitable for opening thin veins that contain thin, yellowish blood. And this is the image of the puncture lancet:
This puncture, which is suitable for incision, comes in various widths and thicknesses, depending on the width or narrowness of the veins. It can be used as a guide for other similar instruments. It is well known among craftsmen.
Regarding the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the ills that are beneath the throat and neck, from the chest and abdomen.  The phlebotomist should be cautious when making the incision, and should be aware of its location. If there is an artery beneath, an error in the lancet's insertion will sever that artery.
Bleeding will result, therefore it is necessary that its incision not be made with a pointed lancet, but rather with a puncture. If the basilic vein is not clearly visible, one should avoid it and turn to another vein or seek one of its branches.
Or, one can incise the brachial artery, which is visible, with the puncture lancet, as we have mentioned. If one desires to incise the basilic vein itself, then before tightening the arm, one should palpate the area until the pulse point is located, then mark it with ink.
Then, the arm is bound, and the vein is incised with a deflected puncture, with the lancet as we mentioned, carefully ensuring the blow is away from the artery's location.  If, upon tightening the bandage, you see a swelling in the marked area, this swelling is the expansion of the artery, so avoid it.
If, during the phlebotomy, you see the blood spurt like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is arterial blood. In that case, quickly place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger.  If the bleeding stops, which often happens, tighten the arm.
Leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it.  Let it be on a pillow, and do not move it for days until healed.  If the bleeding does not stop and you are overcome, and no remedy is available to you at the time, sever the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract, and the bleeding will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell, split it, take one half, and tightly bind it to the vein with bandages until the following day.  If the bleeding stops, do so.  Otherwise, treat it with the previously mentioned application of cauterizing agents to stop the bleeding, and in most cases, severing the blood vessel is not difficult.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the secure binding of the bandage to the arm, know this.  As for the black vein, the benefit of its incision is to draw blood from the top of the head and the bottom of the body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we said.
The phlebotomist should be careful, for beneath the vein are nerves.  If he increases the incision of the lancet and strikes a nerve, numbness will occur that is difficult to see, and it may not heal at all.  This nerve is often noticeable to the touch.
If in some people it is hidden and delicate, not readily apparent, then your incision should be made with a gentle pulling motion, avoiding the nerve as much as possible. If the vein lies between two nerves, incise the vein lengthwise.  As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases, and in this vein especially, if you wish to incise it, use the olive-shaped or the wide, rue-shaped lancet, as it is the safest of all veins, because there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it.
However, when performing the phlebotomy, you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek the soft area.  If the vein is not struck on the first attempt, it is not harmful to repeat the incision several times.  However, it may swell in some people if not struck on the first attempt.
But that swelling will cause no harm.  As for the method of phlebotomy, its symptoms, and what needs to be done for its repair, first of all, you must know that phlebotomy is used to maintain health.
Or it is used for illnesses.  The type used to maintain health and prevent illness should be in one of the three veins of the elbow, namely the cephalic, the acubal, and the basilic.  Phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear.
Phlebotomy should be performed on Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of daylight have passed.  The phlebotomy used for illnesses does not have a limited time; it is done whenever need and necessity demand, whether by night or by day.
At all hours and times.  Boys should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should old men who have passed sixty years.  If anyone intends to perform phlebotomy for any reason...
Before phlebotomy, he should cleanse his bowels with a gentle enema if there is much accumulated mucus, so that foul matter from the intestines will not be drawn into the veins during phlebotomy, harming the vital organs.  The feverish, the drunk, and the intoxicated should not be bled until these conditions have passed.
Phlebotomy should also be avoided following dysentery, vomiting, childbirth, excessive sexual activity, exertion, athletic activity, late nights, and fasting, and any physical or mental exertion that weakens the body.  Then, one should consider thinning the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
Through foods, drinks, and medications if possible, then he should enter a bath if nothing prevents it, or perform some light exercise to thin the blood.  Let his phlebotomy be in the middle of the day, as we have said, and he should clear his mind of all bad thoughts that day.
He should avoid worries, anger, fear, and all physical ailments such as excessive fatigue, exertion, and sexual activity, and so forth.  He should have present the things which people commonly use for their enjoyment, such as perfumes, flowers, amusements, and the like, as much as possible for each individual.
Then the phlebotomist should sit on a higher cushion than the patient, then extend the arm and rub it twice or thrice with his hand, then tighten the bandage with the ligature, twisting it twice or thrice, maintaining a moderate tension.
Because if the tension is not moderate, either excessive tightening will stop the flow of blood, or too much looseness will also prevent the flow of blood.  Then, after tightening, it is necessary for the patient to rub both of his hands together.
Until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch, then the phlebotomist should wipe the lancet with a little bit of old oil, especially, and then place his left index finger on the same vein slightly below the point where he intends to phlebotomize, so that the vein will not move and avoid the strike. For some veins resemble tendons, moving when lanced, and some are filled with air, so when the lancet is placed on them, they recede under the lancet, deceiving the phlebotomist and failing to open the vein, and if it does open, the opening is narrow.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be careful and deliberate in all these matters, and then lower the lancet; if the vein opens at that spot, well and good.  Otherwise, he should return to it again slightly below or above that spot, quickly if the area has not swelled.
If the patient swells or trembles, leave it a day or two and do not tighten the bandage, for it may bring about a hot swelling.  He should not enter a bath, and then he may repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes.  If the lancet was inserted and the opening was small and the blood flow was thin.
And fearing that the desired amount of blood may not be drawn, reinsert the lancet in the same puncture, gently and straight, and slightly enlarge the opening.  Do this quickly, before the area swells, for in many people, the area may swell when the opening is small.
If you see that it has swollen, do not return to it at all; it will not help you. Apply some clarified oil to it; it facilitates blood flow and is better in this location than oil itself or any other ointments.
Use clarified oil in all your phlebotomies when blood flow is difficult.  This remedy, and the *shukhzania*, may also achieve this if applied to the area.  The blood will thin and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of the phlebotomy, which often happens, especially for someone who has not been bled before, or if the vein opening was small, act quickly. Apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water to the swelling and compress it for an hour. It will dissolve.
This should be done after the blood has completely flowed from the vein itself or from another vein. If any discoloration, black or green, remains in the area after a few days, this does not harm. If desired, apply a poultice of bruised and dissolved myrrh.
Or something from the juice of *fudunj* and the like.  A swelling and a protuberance often occur when bleeding basil.  Place your hand on it. If you feel it throbbing when you prod it, it is a bad protuberance. Beware of applying any of the mentioned remedies to it.
For it may bleed arterial blood.  Bandage it with something constricting to harden the area, then treat it with other remedies until healed.  Each person's blood extraction should be according to their strength and the predominant color of their blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red.  Also, if you see it thick, allow it to thin out.  Likewise, if it is sharp, let its sharpness diminish.  For those who are strong and full and require a single bloodletting, this is appropriate.
For the strong, widen the vein incision and use a broad lancet. For the weak, do the opposite.  The blood should be drawn in multiple stages.  The puncture should be narrow.  The best tool for vein incision is a slanted, oblique blade, not a piercing one.
This type of bleeding is free from bleeding and nerve damage.  It is better and safer than transverse or longitudinal bleeding.  If the patient faints during bleeding, it is necessary to give them some bread soaked in pomegranate juice or rosewater before the procedure.
If he is feverish and the blood is drawn in three or four stages, if he has a cool temperament, let him eat bread soaked in pomegranate juice, or honey-based syrup infused with spices, or a fragrant herbal drink before the procedure.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting and it is caused by excessive blood loss, then the patient should be given meat broth and a thin herbal drink.  Fragrant essence should be used to perfume the chest, and all the remedies mentioned in the section on fainting should be applied.
If the bloodletting is for vomiting, and if someone wants to further relieve the arm and draw more blood, for someone whose bloodletting was for excessive vomiting and whose strength is weak, one should release the blood a little at a time, according to the strength, over several days.
If someone wants to relieve their arm and draw blood again, and if their body is strong, then they should do it after seven or nine hours from the first bloodletting.  If one wants to draw blood from the body to the opposite side from which it has collected, then this should be done on the second or third day.
If a person has a lot of blood in their body that has become hot and intense, causing a fever, then the blood should be drawn in a single, large quantity, widening the opening until fainting occurs, after ensuring all bloodletting prerequisites have been met. And place your hand on his pulse while the blood flows, lest death occurs instead of fainting, for this often happens if the bloodletter is ignorant and careless.  This should not be done if you intend to release the arm and draw blood again.
If the vein opening closes and the blood flow becomes difficult, do not forcefully poke or twist it, for that is very bad.  Rather, either leave it until you can open it again, or use the lancet blade to remove any clotted blood from the vein opening.
Or apply something dissolved in water, like salt, or a potent antidote like faruq or shakhznaya, and gently poke the vein until blood flows. If the vein has swollen, leave it.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If, despite this, there is a need to draw blood again, then either draw from the same spot above the swelling, or from the other arm, or another vein.
For drawing blood from the vein in the upper arm, use it in place of the akhal and basaliq if those are not available or hidden, because it combines their properties.  To perform the procedure, the patient should put their hand into hot water until their forearm is red and the vein clearly visible.  Then, gently but firmly bind the area with a bandage.
Then, draw blood from the vein slightly off-center, neither horizontally nor vertically.  Make a wide opening, and puncture slightly above the wrist joint. If the blood flow is difficult, put the arm back in the hot water, and allow the blood to flow into the water.
Until you have obtained the desired amount. If it is summer, you may not need to return the arm to the hot water.  The use of hot water is mainly needed during winter to facilitate blood flow.  Drawing from this vein is safer than from any other vein. Because there is no major vein or nerve beneath it.  Drawing blood from the asylem vein in the right arm is beneficial for liver ailments.  To do this, bind the wrist with a bandage or your hand, after having immersed the arm in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no major vein or nerve beneath it.  Drawing blood from the asylem vein in the right arm is beneficial for liver ailments.  To do this, bind the wrist with a bandage or your hand, after having immersed the arm in hot water until the vein swells. The vein will be very apparent.  Then, puncture the vein slightly off-center.  If you sever it completely, it will not harm him.  Be cautious; do not use the lancet too forcefully.  Beneath the vein is the nerve for the fingers, and the area is exposed flesh. Then return the arm to the hot water.
Leave it to flow.  If you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and stop flowing.  Once you have drawn the required amount of blood, apply a mixture of oil and salt to the vein to prevent rapid clotting.
Likewise, you should do this with every narrow vein.  Drawing blood from the left arm is beneficial for spleen ailments.  Do the same procedure as you did with the second vein.  As for drawing from the saphenous vein, it is beneficial for illnesses in the lower body, such as problems with the uterus.
And for menstrual retention, kidney ailments, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.  The procedure for drawing blood from this vein is to immerse the leg in hot water and massage it until the veins swell.  Then, bind above the joint of the leg with a bandage. The vein is located near the heel, visible towards the big toe.
Many branches extend from it on the side of the leg.  Draw blood from the widest branch or near the heel, where the branches meet. This is the best and safest approach. If you draw blood on the side of the leg, be careful of the nerves beneath the skin on the side of the leg.
Make your incision with a twisting motion, as if you were trying to sever it, and the lancet should be sharp. If the blood is difficult to draw, return the leg to hot water and let the blood flow until it is empty.  If the surgeon misses the vein on the first attempt.
Then, move the incision slightly upwards.  The area is safe, and there is no danger if you are careful about the nerve, as we have mentioned.  Do the same for the saphenous vein on the other leg.  As for the vein of the woman, its location is, as we stated, at the heel on the outer side.
Its use is for hip pain if it is caused by hot blood.  The method for drawing blood is to have the patient enter a bath and quickly bind their leg from the hip to above the heel with a thin, long bandage.  Only then will it appear.
If it appears, draw blood, in any case.  Either by twisting (which is best), or cutting off a piece, or by slicing it. The area is safe. In most people, it is very hidden; if you do not find it.
If it does not appear at all to the touch, draw blood from some of its branches, which appear on the back of the foot near the little and ring fingers.  Be mindful of the nerves and draw the amount of blood desired.
Then release the bandage. Place a cotton pad on the incision site and bandage the area.  It will quickly heal.
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On Cupping and its Application.
Cupping vessels can be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass.  Cupping can be done in two ways: one is cupping with a ligature, drawing out blood; the other is cupping without a ligature.
This cupping without a ligature is also twofold.
The cupping vessels of the sides of the neck, both sides, the chin cupping under the lower jaw of the mouth, the cupping of the shoulders, the cupping of the coccyx on the tailbone, the cupping of the forearms in the middle of the arms, the cupping of the legs, and the cupping of the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the thin veins dispersed in the flesh, and for this reason it does not weaken the strength as much as venesection.  Cupping, whether by fire or otherwise, should not be used for any illness caused by fullness until the whole body is emptied.
If cupping is needed, either for illness or for habitual use, we employ it at any time, at the beginning, middle, and end of the month.
For some, when there is an excess of blood requiring cupping, they experience heaviness and headaches in their heads; others experience fullness, redness in their face, head, and neck; some experience itching in their face, temples, and dark circles and swelling around their eyes; and others itch the site of their cupping.
Some laugh excessively; some taste blood in their mouths, and their gums bleed; some spit up blood; some sleep excessively; some see blood, redness, battles, and wounds, and the like, in their dreams.  Whenever we observe any of this,
Especially if it occurs in the middle third of the month, we then prescribe cupping after two or three hours have passed of the day.  The benefit of cupping (at that time) is for heaviness of the head and watery discharge from the eyes.
However, this should be done after the whole body has been emptied. This cupping can be a substitute for phlebotomy of the temples.  Caution should be taken not to use it on those with a cold head or cold, as it will greatly harm them.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly or those with cold conditions in their head.  Those who habitually use it may suffer forgetfulness.
Therefore, the cupper should lower the cupping vessel slightly, for fear of inducing forgetfulness.  As for cupping the shoulder, it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the temples and the vein on the scalp.
Therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, disjunction of the breathing apparatus, coughing and fullness.  The cupping of the shoulder should be raised slightly, for if it is positioned too low, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it is beneficial for pains in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, choking, and toothache.  It is a substitute for phlebotomy of the scalp.  The cupper should be instructed not to insert the cupping vessel too deeply into the skin, lest a vessel be cut and excessive bleeding result.
As for cupping under the chin, it is beneficial for sores in the mouth, gum disease, and similar mouth ailments.  It can take the place of venesection of the vessels in the lips.  As for cupping the shoulders, it is beneficial for palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
As for cupping the hollows of the forearms, it is beneficial for what is beneficial in the venesection of the three veins: the scalp vein, the temple vein, and the vein on the neck.  Because it draws blood from all the thin veins in the flesh and draws those thin veins from other thicker veins until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to press too deeply into the skin, for the area is lacking flesh and has nerves and blood vessels beneath.  As for a single cupping vessel applied to the coccyx, it is beneficial for hemorrhoids and sores of the lower rectum.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large, copper cupping vessel, for the area requires strong suction and glass cupping vessels might break.  A great deal of pressure is needed.  As for cupping the legs, it clearly reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the whole body and benefits chronic ailments of the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, it induces menstruation, benefits boils and abscesses, and serves as a substitute for venesection of the saphenous and popliteal veins. However, it greatly exhausts the body and causes fainting in most people. Cupping the popliteal veins is similar in benefit to cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping is to first place the empty cupping vessel and apply moderate suction. Do not prolong the application of cupping, but quickly place and quickly remove the cups to allow the humors to flow to the area evenly.  Continue repeating this until the area reddens and opens.
When the redness of blood appears, then apply pressure and resume suction gradually.  Then observe the condition of the bodies.  For those with loose, porous flesh, a single pressure should be applied, lest the area become ulcerated.
The cupper should widen the pressure, deepening it slightly, and adjust the suction with gentle movement.  If the blood is thick, it should be pressed twice. In the first instance, to open a path for the thin, watery blood; and in the second, to completely remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very opaque, the pressure should be repeated a third time to achieve the desired outcome. In general, if we wish to remove a small amount of blood, a single pressure suffices; if we want to remove a large amount, we apply more pressure.  If we judge the blood to be thick.
A deep pressure should be applied, the moderate limit being the depth of the skin.  What ointments and waters should be used when applying cupping, and what the cupper should avoid?  As for those with thick, hard, dry skin and narrow pores...
The areas for cupping should be anointed with softening, dissolving, opening ointments.  In summer, for example, ointments of frankincense, violet, sweet almond, or pumpkin seed.
In winter, for example, ointments of narcissus, lily, chamomile, or similar hyacinth. If the impurities are thick and cold, then use ointments of marjoram, rue, benzoin, or dill, and the like.
If the cupper has wide pores and soft flesh, then ointment should be avoided.  These people should wash their cupping vessels after cupping with rosewater, cold water, elderberry water, pumpkin water, or similar, and as for those whose blood is excessively moist...
They should wash their cupping vessels with vinegar, or with rue and sumac water, and the like.  As for those with thick impurities, they should wash their cupping vessels with old wine, or marjoram water, or dill or chamomile broth, and the like.  Cupping should be avoided in the bath and immediately after the bath.
Rather, it should be used an hour or two after leaving the bath.  One should not sleep after cupping.  This is what the cupper and the leeches should consider before and after cupping.
First, one must consider if the cupper or leech is bilious, and if their blood is predominantly hot and inflamed, then they should take cooling foods such as pomegranate, dandelion, vinegar, lettuce, sour wine, and the like.  Their food should consist of chicken, lamb, and other similar lean meats.
If one's temperament is cold, they should be given honeyed drinks, or quince drinks, or basil sour wine.  They should take medium-aged, fragrant wine, and be instructed to eat sparingly.  Their food should consist of chicken, quail, sparrows, and doves.  The drink should be more than the food on the day of cupping and bloodletting.
Sometimes, certain people may be given a dose of the Faruq antidote, musk medicine, or sheeltha before cupping and bloodletting, or afterwards, to strengthen the main organs and thin the blood.  However, those who are feverish should not be given these.
As for cupping without any specific condition, these are cupping applications to the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidneys, and hip joints, because these organs cannot tolerate specific conditions.  The goal is either to draw blood from one organ to another.
For example, placing a cupping vessel on the breasts in cases of epistaxis, or to remove a cold wind that has affected an organ, as when placing a cupping vessel on the abdomen and navel; this loosens the organ, warms it, and relieves the pain by dissolving that wind.
Cupping can also be applied to the kidneys if a blockage or stones are present, as its strong drawing power may open the blockage or dislodge the stones.  Similarly, it can be used on the liver and spleen when wind affects them.  These cupping vessels may be used empty, by suction only.
Cupping may be used with fire, or filled with lukewarm water for conditions like sores.  This involves filling a large cupping vessel with hot water alone, or water in which some suitable herbs have been boiled.
Then, filled, it is placed on the affected area, held, and removed, repeated as needed.  This is the method of cupping using fire.
Its opening is the width of two open fingers, as depicted, and its depth is half a span.  A small hole, just large enough for a needle to pass through, is situated near the middle on the side. It is made from thick-rimmed Chinese or yellow brass.
It is smooth, flat, and polished to avoid injuring the organ when placed on it.  A cross-shaped piece of brass or iron is in the center, where the candle is placed in the fire.  Such a cupping vessel can be made large or smaller than described, according to the illness.
The appropriate cupping vessel depends on the user.  Cupping vessels for children and thin individuals are different from those for men and those with larger bodies.  The method for applying fire to the affected area is to light a tightly wound cotton wick or small pitch candle, and place it on the central rod within the cupping vessel.
So that the fire rises from the top towards the bottom of the cupping vessel to prevent burning the patient's body. Then it is placed on the affected area, and the finger is placed on the hole we mentioned, so that when holding the cupping vessel, the finger does not need to be removed.
Steam will emerge from that hole, and the cupping vessel will adhere to the location. Then the wick is re-lit as needed.  However, the cupping vessel used for water-based scabies does not have a fixed rod or a hole.
Instead, it is used by filling it with water and placing it directly on the affected area.  This is its image/form.
The larger the cupping vessel, the better, as it can hold more water.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
On the application of leeches.
Leeches are used mostly on parts of the body where cupping cannot be applied, either due to their small size, such as the lip, gums, and the like, or because the area is exposed without flesh, such as the finger and nose, and the like.
To use them, select leeches from clean fresh water, free from impurities, and leave them in fresh water for a day and a night so they will be hungry and have nothing in their stomachs. Then the body is first evacuated by bloodletting or cupping, and then the affected area is cleansed.
Until it reddens, then a leech is placed upon it.  If it becomes full, it falls off.  If the affected area can be cupped, this is more beneficial.  Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and rub and squeeze it.  If bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and it is a oozing, then soak a linen cloth in cold water.
Place it over the area until the oozing stops. If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered alum or astringent or similar coagulants on the area until the bleeding stops, or place peeled halves of chickpeas on the area.
Leave them until the chickpeas adhere to the area; then the bleeding will stop.  If leeches need to be reapplied, if possible, do not use the same leeches; if leeches refuse to attach, then clean the area with fresh blood.
Or pierce the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then place [a leech] there.  If it feels some blood, it will attach to the spot. If you want it to fall off, sprinkle some sorrel, salt, or ash on it, and it will fall off.
Chapter Three.
On Fractures.
This chapter also, from the subtleties of the medical art, is concerned with the setting of fractures and dislocations of the bones.
Know, my children, that many physicians and laypeople, those who have never reviewed the writings of the ancients on this topic or read a single letter from them, claim expertise in this chapter.
For this reason, this field of knowledge has become nonexistent in our land, and I have never encountered a practitioner who excels in it. Rather, I have gained what I have gained through prolonged study of the books of the ancients and my diligence in understanding them, so that I extracted knowledge from them.  Then, I devoted my entire life to practice and skill.
I have depicted for you in this chapter everything that my knowledge encompasses. My experience has been applied to it, after I brought it closer to you, purged it of unnecessary detail, and made it extremely concise, elucidated it fully, and presented numerous images of the instruments used in it.
This is an addition to the explanation, as I did in the previous two chapters.  There is no strength except from God, the Most High, the Greatest.
Chapter One.
It contains summaries and essential points concerning the fracture of bones.  Before we begin to describe the fractured and dislocated members one by one, it is necessary to mention some general statements and chapters at the beginning of this chapter. This will first compel you, and anyone else eager to learn this noble craft, to understand and grasp its truth.
If a person suffers a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall, one should first apply treatment to set the fracture or reduce the dislocation, or both. Unless there is a hindrance such as weakness of the body, or the person affected is a child or very old person, or the time is exceptionally hot or cold.
Then, his diet should be restricted to cold legumes, poultry, and venison. He should avoid drinking, fatty meats, overeating, and any food that causes blood to flood the veins until the swelling subsides and there is no further anticipation of material leaking into the area.
Then the patient should return to his original regimen, which he habitually followed. If the fractured bone begins to knit, the patient should eat foods that are nutritious, thick, strong, and viscous, such as lentils, rice, heads of grain, and the ribs and bellies of cattle. Eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and similar foods, will accelerate and improve the healing of the fracture.  Know that fractures in strong men and elderly people will never completely reconnect and heal to their original state.
Because of the dryness and hardness of their bones, those in the most flexible state, like the bones of young children, may reconnect. However, nature produces a substance resembling glue, thick and adhesive, around the fractured bone from all sides, to hold the bone fragments together firmly.
It binds them together until they reach the same strength and security they originally had, so nothing interferes with their function.
Therefore, the patient's diet should consist of strong, viscous, and thick foods, as previously mentioned.  Know that fractures vary according to the affected body part, as a fracture in the leg differs from one in the head, and a fracture in the chest differs from one in the spine.
Similarly, all other parts differ from one another. We will discuss each type of fracture in detail in its respective section, and the type of fracture may also differ within the same bone.
For the fracture might be a simple break without splinters, or it might be a lengthwise fracture with splinters, detached or not detached, and there may be a fracture with a wound and a tear in the skin, or a minor crack.
Each type requires a specific method for its repair, as will be explained in detail in its place.  Signs of a fracture include the bone's crookedness, its unevenness, its visibility to touch, and its grating sound when pressed with your hand.
If there is no visible distortion, no grating, no perceptible disturbance when palpating the bone, and the patient does not experience much pain, then it is not a fracture, but possibly a contusion, a minor fracture, or a minor crack.  The injured part should not be moved or prodded at all.
Instead, apply the medicines to be described later, suitable for the affected area, then apply a gentle bandage.  And know that when a bone is fractured and splintered into two pieces, though no splinters are formed, every part has been displaced from its companion.
You should immediately attempt to reposition and align it before a hot swelling develops.  If a hot swelling does appear, leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides, then realign it by any gentle and skillful means possible.
Know that setting and aligning a bone is easier when no splinters are present.  Then, it is bandaged as will be described.  However, if there are splinters, the fractured limb (whether an arm or a leg) must be stretched from both sides.
Either by your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with both ropes and hands.  Place the limb on a flat surface in its natural position.  When the fractured bone parts have been pulled apart, carefully and gently return the protrusions to their proper places.
Strive to cause no pain or discomfort to the patient through your actions.  Do your utmost to reunite the two bone fragments in the best possible alignment.  At that time, you should touch and feel them with your hand.  If you perceive anything out of place, correct and realign it to the best of your ability.
Avoid excessive stretching and forceful pulling, as many unskilled practitioners do.  Often, their actions cause a hot swelling or inflammation in the limb, as I have repeatedly observed.
After the alignment, meticulous work, and bandaging, keep the limb still and at rest. Warn the patient not to move it during wakefulness, sleep, turning, restlessness, bowel movements, and all other activities to the best of their ability.  Ensure that the limb's position provides pain-free support.
If, while maintaining that position, the patient feels pain or discomfort, he should shift to a different position in which he experiences no pain.  He should ensure that this new position is straight and aligned.
To prevent the limb from becoming deformed if it is set, and regarding how to bandage a fractured limb, I am describing it as follows:  Know that fractured limbs vary in size, condition, and structure.  Smaller limbs like the arm, finger, forearm, and similar, ...
The bandages should be gentle and light for smaller limbs like the arm or finger.  For larger limbs, such as the thigh, back, or chest, the bandages should be firm and substantial, since a wide bandage is required to support and firmly bind the larger limb on all sides equally without gaps.
Then, after completing the alignment, apply the appropriate plaster. Apply a soft bandage to the fracture site.  Then, bandage the fracture site three or four times, depending on the limb's requirements. Gently tighten the bandage and move it up towards the upper portion of the fracture.
Apply less tension than you applied to the fractured area. Gradually increase the distance between the bandages and the fracture site, easing the tension slightly until a satisfactory position is achieved. Then, take another bandage and wrap it around the fractured area as well.
Wrap further, then move the bandage down towards the lower part of the fracture.  Maintain the tension and looseness of the bandages as described for the initial (upper) wrapping.  Place padding, such as soft bandages or cloth, between the layers of bandages to correct any misalignment of the fracture.
If there is misalignment, correct it. Otherwise, do not add anything. Then wrap another bandage over this.  Apply firm splints over these layers, if there is no swelling or inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or inflammation, apply something to relieve the swelling and reduce the puffiness. Leave it for a few days, then apply the splints. The splints should be made from broad, skillfully-cut pieces of cane or from the wood of sieves.
Made from pine, palm leaves, reeds, or other similar readily available materials.  The size of each splint should be precisely the same.
However, the splint placed directly over the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others.  The length of the splint should be appropriate to the size of the fractured limb.  Image of the splint:
Then, wrap the splints with another bandage, using the same tightness as the first layer.  Secure from above with firm stitches, ensuring the tightening is more pronounced at the fractured area. The tighter the wrapping, the closer to the fracture.
The threads should be of medium thickness and not too thin, preferably made of damp linen.  If the threads are thick, like those used by ignorant practitioners, made from twisted linen strips, this is a grave error.
Because the tension will be uneven.  Thin threads are also unsuitable, as they will not allow the desired tension.  There should be at least one finger's width between the splints.
If the patient is injured by the edges of the splints after proper tightening, place soft padding or fluffy wool under them to avoid further injury.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and the skin is broken, we will address that separately.
Know that not every fractured limb needs splinting from the first day.  If the limb is large, splints should not be applied until five, seven, or more days later, depending on the risk of inflammation.
This is the description of the dressings used by the ancients to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  It's a general, concise dressing that sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is not affected by either heat or cold.
Take the flour dust, the fine particles that cling to the millstones during grinding. Knead it as it is, without sifting it with egg white.  Make the dough neither thick nor thin, then bake it.
Another dressing for fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  Take ten dirhams each of mastic, ladanum, acacia, raisin, and mugwort, five dirhams each of myrrh and mastic tree, and twenty dirhams of Armenian/Roman clay. Grind all the ingredients and mix them with acacia water, or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot.  Use this dressing, as it is well-combined; it quickly sets broken bones and is suitable for most people due to its balance.
Another dressing useful for fractures and sprains: take ten dirhams each of mugwort, mastic, and white hellebore, five dirhams each of myrrh and mastic tree, six dirhams of acacia, and twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind all thoroughly, sift, knead with water or egg white, and apply.
A dressing for joints and displaced bones, relieving pain and bone fractures and fissures.  Take prepared wool, dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply to the affected area.  This dressing does not have the strength of a binding agent.
However, it excels in relieving hot swelling and pain. Another dressing for broken bones: take leaves of the fig tree and wild poppy, grind them both together, and apply as a poultice. Another concise dressing is used when a broken bone is displaced.
To analyze the remaining swelling, take parts of hellebore root, chamomile, violet, and quince flour, grind all together, and knead with a paste. If the limb is not inflamed, knead with the paste. If inflamed, knead with coriander water or water, and apply.
Another stronger dressing for resolving the swelling that occurs when a bone is displaced: take equal parts of hellebore root, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, violet, and chamomile.
Grind all together and knead with the water of a certain plant, or with fresh water, or with a paste, according to the heat of the limb and the subsidence of its heat.  Hippocrates did not mention in his book that it should be applied to a fractured limb during its reduction.
Except for the plaster made from wax and oil, nothing else. He described it to be medium thickness, neither thick nor thin.  Galen believed that things with dryness and some heat, like myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, should be applied to the injured limb during its reduction.
A dressing for weakness and pain: Take equal parts of mugwort, roasted chickpeas, shaved human hair or bird feathers, hellebore, and salt. Grind, sieve, knead, and apply as a dressing.  And how much of the ligament should remain...
Then, consider: if the injured person experiences no pain, no rubbing, and no displacement of the broken bone, do not remove it for many days.  However, if there is severe rubbing, troublesome pain, or swelling in the affected area, remove it.
Immediately remove it and do not delay. Remove the dressing. Then, take a soft cloth or a damp sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the rubbing subsides and the pain lessens.  Then, allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Then, apply softened wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bandage it overnight, to alleviate inflammation, swelling of the limb, and pain.  Then, return to a gentle bandage and light dressing. Do not apply the initial tight bandage.
Care for it until it heals.  If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and swelling have completely subsided, and the dressing and bandage are needed, reapply them as you did at first,  in the same manner. If nothing of what we mentioned occurs to the limb, [do nothing further].
Do not remove it until three, four, five, or seven days, or even twenty days; all according to the condition of the limb, as we said, until the fracture is firmly set and the flesh around it has healed.
Then, increase the bandage's tightness even further than the initial application.  Also increase the patient's nourishment, as previously mentioned. If you see the fracture site has dried out and wasted more than it should, know that the nourishment is not reaching it.
Unwrap it with lukewarm water each time you remove it, every three days.  Ease up on the bandage slightly.  By doing this, nourishment flows to the limb and it heals quickly.  As for what the ignorant practitioners of fracture setting do, to break the limb again, ...
If it is not set properly the first time, and is set crookedly, it is an error on their part and a great deception. Even if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and employed it. I have seen no trace of this in any of them. The correct approach is not to use it.
Chapter Two.
On fractures of the head.
Fractures of the head are numerous, their shapes varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and they may be such that the entire bone is fractured down to the peritoneum beneath the bone. As is done to wood by the carpenter.
In this way, this type of fracture is called a carpenter's fracture; or the sword may have cut only a part of the bone and fractured only one surface, not penetrating through it completely; this type of fracture is called a simple fracture. The wound from either of these fractures may be large or small.
Some fractures are caused by contusion or impact, such as a blow from a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar.  This fracture may be penetrating, having approached the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be superficial, on the surface of the bone.
The wounds from these fractures also may be large or small.  Some fractures are hidden within the bone, subtle like a hairline crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.  Some are caused by falls or blows from stones or similar objects, where a part of the bone surface penetrates inward, creating a depression, like when a blow damages copper and a part of it sinks in.
This is most common in the soft, bony skulls of children.  All these types of fractures may have displaced or undisplaced fragments.  We will describe the treatment of each in its place.  All these types of fractures can be identified by examination.
Examining them with probes and removing putrefied flesh from them.  The hairline fracture is identified by examining the bone, wiping and staining it with ink.  The fracture appears black.  Treatment of the fracture first considers the patient's symptoms.
If you observe clear signs of danger, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, bloodshot eyes, redness, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat them.  In most cases, death is inevitable with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and hope for his recovery, then proceed with treatment.  If the injured person comes to you immediately after the injury, and this is during the winter months, ...
In any case, you should diligently remove the bone before the 14th day.  If it is during the summer months, you should quickly remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane beneath the bone rots, causing the symptoms we described.
If the fractured bone has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is a crush and injury, you should cut away the crushed and injured part, as I describe to you: shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way possible, according to the shape of the wound and what is tolerable for the patient.  If during the exposure of the bone, you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling, address that accordingly.
Fill the area with rags soaked in a mixture of potion, rose oil, and astringent.  Clean the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops.  Then begin to manipulate and remove the bone.  This can be done in one of two ways.
One method is to cut the bone with a narrow, delicate incision.  This is its depiction:
Then, use another incision, slightly wider than the first.  This is its depiction:
Then, use yet another incision, wider still than the second.  It is necessary to have a set of various incisions, some wider than others, some shorter than others, with very sharp edges, made of Indian steel or good quality steel.
Use gentleness when striking the incision, so as not to dislodge the head and injure it.  If the bone is strong and hard, it is advisable to bore around it before using the incisions, with awls called "awls not submerged.
Because they do not exceed the limit of the skull bone, going beyond it.  The awl has a rounded edge below its sharp head, resembling a ring or small circle, preventing it from sinking and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
You should prepare a large number of these awls, each suitable for the thickness of the bone, so that you have, for each skull, an awl whose sharp tip is appropriate in length and shortness for the thickness of that skull.  Here are the images of three types. Of awls, large, medium, and small.
To pierce around the fractured bone, place the awl on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced. Then, move the awl to another location, leaving a distance between each hole equal to the thickness of a rod, or similar.
Then, with the forceps, cut between each pair of holes, using as much gentleness as possible, as we said, until you remove the bone, either by hand or with another tool that you have prepared for that purpose.
Such as fine splints and forceps.  You must be extremely careful that the awl or forceps do not touch the peritoneum. If you have straightened the bone and freed it from the peritoneum, if it was attached to it, and removed it, then it must be cleaned.
And smooth out any roughness remaining on the bone with another instrument similar to the forceps, but it must be finer and gentler than the other forceps.  If any small pieces or fragments of bone remain, remove them gently with the tools you have.
Then, treat the wound afterwards with bandages and ointments, which will be described later.  The other approach to this work is exceptionally simple and free from risk.  Galen described it and praised it highly.  This is what he said. First, you should begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and prominent.  Once you have exposed that part, place the tip of this lenticular forceps beneath it.  This is its image:
The lenticular part of it should be smooth, so as not to cut anything, and the sharp part should have its long edges as you see.  The lenticular part should rest against the peritoneum, and the sharp edge of the forceps should be on the bone.  Then strike the forceps from one side.
With a small hammer, so as to break all the bone gently, as it turns, and you are safe from injuring the membrane, with no terrible accident happening at all, even if the surgeon were the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were asleep.
If any membrane remains attached to the bone in some places, scrape it off with the tip of the lenticular forceps itself, and remove it gently.  It will come off without injury or fear.
If the fracture of the bone did not penetrate the membrane and the broken part of the bone was rough and had splinters, then you should remove that roughness and those splinters with small rasps of varying sizes, so that you can use the most appropriate one for each place, according to what the work requires.
With the broken bone and its shape, you should begin by using the widest rasps for cleaning the bone, then use narrower ones, and continue this way until you use the smallest and finest of them all.
As for the smaller, hairline fractures and minor breaks, you should apply treatment to each according to its requirements.  This is something not hidden from those who have the slightest skill in this craft and have studied what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, you should take a linen cloth sized to the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound's opening.  Then take another cloth, folded or triangular. Soak it in rosewater and rose oil, place it on top of the first cloth, and do this gently so as not to weigh down the peritoneum.  Then apply a wide bandage over it, but only tighten it enough to hold the wound closed.
Leave it with this treatment for one or two days until the hot swelling subsides.  Then remove it and use afterwards the drying medications such as iris root, carob flour, kandar, and zarawand, and similar substances.  Make these into powders.
Dust the wound with these dry powders.  In general, use a medicine that cleanses without stinging.  Make every effort during the treatment of the wound to keep it clean, free of grease, dirt, or pus; never allow pus to accumulate in it.
Because if pus collects on the meninges, it corrupts and putrifies them, causing a great affliction to the patient.  This can occur in the skull's peritoneum when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
A dark discoloration on its surface.  If the patient displays the symptoms we mentioned, know that he is doomed.  If the discoloration occurred due to a medication applied, and the medication's strength was such that it caused this discoloration.
Then you should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, thoroughly mix them, and apply the mixture to a cloth. Place the cloth on the peritoneum and continue treating it with the necessary remedies until it heals.
Chapter Three.
In setting a broken nose.
Know that only the upper nasal bones, either both or one, can break, for they are bones. The lower part is cartilaginous, and does not break, but can become bruised, bent, or deformed.
If one of the nasal bones is broken, you should insert the little finger into the nostril and straighten the fracture from the inside with your index and thumb from the outside, restoring the nose to its natural shape.  Be gentle and careful to avoid causing pain to the patient.
If the fracture is high up on the nose and cannot be reached by the finger, it should be straightened with a blunt, slightly thickened instrument. If the fracture is in both sides, do the same.  He should undertake the reduction on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise, after seven or ten days when the acute swelling subsides, insert a linen thread into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or two threads if the fracture is on both sides.
The thread should be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some earlier practitioners of fracture reduction recommended soaking the thread in ghee and changing it every day. I, however, do not find this necessary. Instead, the thread should be soaked in beaten egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the thread until the bone is set and the cartilage is firm.  After wrapping soft linen around them, goose quill tubes can be inserted into the nostril where the thread is, making the nasal support more secure, and preventing the patient from being unable to breathe.
This is not essential.  If you wish, you may do it, or if you wish, you may use the threads.  If during your work a hot swelling appears on the nose, bandage the nose with linen cloth or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil or a diachylon plaster.
If no hot swelling appears, it is necessary to bandage it externally with semolina and crushed kandar (a spice) mixed with beaten egg white, then place a soft bandage on top.  Do not tie the nose at all, if the nasal bones are fractured in small pieces.
Or if it is fragmented, it is necessary to split it open and remove it with a suitable instrument, then suture the split and treat it with healing and suppurative ointments appropriate for that. If a wound occurs inside the nose, it is necessary to treat it with thread and use lead tubes. Until it heals.
Fourth Chapter.
On the setting of a fractured lower jaw.
If the lower jaw is fractured, and the fracture is not accompanied by an open wound, if the fracture is only from the outside and does not break into two pieces and does not curve inward, then its identification is easy.
If the fracture is in the right side, the index finger of the left hand should be inserted into the patient's mouth.  Similarly, if the fracture is in the left side, the index finger of the right hand should be inserted and gently lift the bump of the fracture from inside to outside.
With your other hand outside the bone, control its alignment.  If the jaw fracture has broken into two pieces, then traction must be applied from both sides in a straight line until alignment is achieved. If it has occurred in the teeth, it should be trimmed.
Or, separate what you expect to remain, securing it with a gold, silver, or silk thread.  Then place a splint on the fractured jaw, followed by a folded cloth, and finally place a large, tight bandage or a piece of leather the same length as the jaw over the cloth. Then, tie it from above in whatever way seems appropriate for its closure, so it does not dislocate.  Instruct the patient to rest and abstain from strenuous activity. Provide the patient with soft, digestible food. If you suspect a change in its condition in any way, reopen it on the third day.
Then, tie it from above in whatever way seems appropriate for its closure, so it does not dislocate.  Instruct the patient to rest and abstain from strenuous activity. Provide the patient with soft, digestible food. If you suspect a change in its condition in any way, reopen it on the third day. Then, mend what you bandaged with mill dust and egg white or semolina flour after removing the splint. Place a soft, supple cloth over the bandage. As long as the bandage adheres and the bone shows no change, leave it in place.
Do not reopen it until the fracture heals and strengthens.  This fracture often strengthens in three weeks.  If, during that time, a hot swelling appears, use the methods previously described to alleviate it until it subsides.
If the fracture is accompanied by an open wound, and if a piece or pieces of bone have become detached, then carefully remove these pieces with appropriate instruments. If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a surgical saw as needed.
Then, if you have removed all the bone fragments, if the wound is wide, suture it; otherwise, apply a suitable ointment. And suture the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the setting of a fractured clavicle.
The clavicle is most often fractured from the front, at the acromial end.  The fracture can occur in one of three ways: either it fractures and splinters into two pieces without splinters, which is easiest to set.
Or, the fracture may involve splinters, which is harder to set. Or the fracture may be accompanied by a wound.  If the fracture is without a wound, have two assistants; one should hold the arm next to the fractured clavicle, the other should extend the neck to the opposite side.
Then adjust the fracture with your fingers until it is correctly shaped, with neither a protrusion nor a deformity. If further traction is needed, place a ball of linen or wool under the patient's armpit.
Hold the bone as needed, and stretch and lift the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you cannot draw the clavicle outward because it has sunk inward, the patient should lie on their back.
Place a medium-sized pillow under his shoulder.  The assistant should press down on his shoulder so that the deep-seated clavicle bone rises up.  Then correct and align the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a splinter of the clavicle has broken off and is moving, you should carefully remove it.  If the splinter is embedded in the bone, use one of the surgical instruments prepared for this purpose to carefully remove it. After placing the instrument that protects the diaphragm (an instrument made of wood or iron) under the clavicle, this is its image.
It resembles a spoon, without any embellishments. Its width should be according to the size of the bone, and its length should also be according to what you need for the work.  It should have two ends, one wider and the other narrower, as you see.
If the wound you made when removing the bone splinter is wide and you fear inflammation, then close the edges of the wound with sutures.  If the opening is small or you fear inflammation, then close the wound with stitches and bandages proportionate to the wound's size.
If a hot inflammation appears, soak the bandages in rose oil and vinegar or potion and apply them.  As for strengthening the bone, if there is no wound or incision, apply a bandage made from mill dust and egg white to the bone. Place a soft splint on it, then place a ball under his armpit if needed.  Then take a very long turban, its width about a span or so, and apply a folded bandage over the splint and dressing.  Then take a splint made of thin wood. Its width should be three fingers and its length likewise. Then place it in a cloth, then place that cloth with the splint in the part of the turban that lies over the fracture.  Then tightly wrap the turban around the fracture as you would wrap a turban. And wrap it around his neck and under his healthy armpit and under his injured armpit, and repeat it several times on each side.  How you see that the tension secures the fracture firmly, is something that is clear to you.
The whole purpose is that the splint must not move from the fractured bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day.  Whenever the ligaments relax and you see the splint has shifted, correct it and tighten the bandage.  Then ensure the patient sleeps on their back and place a small pillow under their armpit at night.
To raise his arm away from his side so that the fractured collarbone is raised with the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck.  Do not loosen the bandage unless a wound or swelling occurs at the site, until twelve days have passed.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. Apply pressure and leave it until the fractured collarbone heals and becomes firm.  It will strengthen and become more solid within twenty-eight days. And it may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
On the setting of a fractured shoulder.  The shoulder rarely fractures at its widest point, but rather at its projections.  Therefore, whenever a portion is fractured, or if it is fractured mid-shoulder, this can only be discerned by palpation.  Then, based on the nature of the fracture, apply a splint.
Reduce it [the fracture] to its natural shape by every possible means, then apply to the area ground-up millstone dust, egg white, and soft linen. Place over this a bandage made of folded cloth and then apply a wide splint made of wood.
Make the splint as wide as the entire shoulder, or slightly wider.  If there is a protrusion under the splint in any part of the shoulder, smooth this protrusion with soft linen until the splint lies flat.  Then bind it from above with a long bandage.
Tighten the binding and secure the splint so that it does not shift.  Inspect the bandage each day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it shifts.  The patient should lie on their healthy side.  The shoulder heals in twenty days.
(One) or twenty-five days. When this period is complete, remove the bandage; you are safe.  For it is one of those bones where one does not fear its splintering or displacement.  If a fragment of bone protrudes from the skin and is irritating beneath the skin, make an incision and remove it. Do what was mentioned regarding the treatment of a swollen clavicle if such a thing occurs.
Chapter Seven.
In the setting of a fractured rib.
The ribs can fracture in the middle, but this is infrequent.  The ends are more prone to fracture and fragmentation.  Symptoms of a fractured midsection include tilting downwards, severe pain, and difficulty breathing and coughing.
There may also be expectorated blood, and the depression in the fractured bone is evident and palpable.  Treatment involves the patient lying on their back, with a pillow placed between their shoulders.  Then, the patient's sides are pressed down, and the ribs are brought together with the hands from the sides.  The fractured area should be gently aligned in all possible directions.
Maintain this alignment until the bone returns to its proper shape, then apply a bandage and splints. Place a splint made of thin wood or similar lightweight material such as poplar or willow over this, wrapped in cloth. Then gently bind it to the fractured bone to prevent displacement.  Wrap the bandage around the back in a circular motion several times, tightening it firmly.  Regularly check the bandage, and tighten it whenever it loosens.
If the situation requires removing the splint due to inflammation, pain, or swelling at the site, immediately remove it and the bandage, and address any issues with appropriate treatment.  If appropriate, reapply the bandage. And apply pressure and maintain the dressing until healing occurs.
Chapter Eight.
In the setting of fractured ribs, know that fractures typically occur in the thick portions near the spine and their anterior extremities.  This is because they are cartilaginous, and their injury is easily discernible from feeling with fingers.
To set the fracture, align the broken pieces with the fingers, ensuring a proper shape.  Then bandage and apply a splint if needed to secure the fractured bone. If the rib fracture is angled inward, it causes the patient severe pain.
And the pain is like that of a person with a hernia, because the bone pierces the diaphragm, causing difficulty breathing, coughing, and profuse spitting of blood. This is a difficult condition to treat.  The ancients devised many methods for it.
Some have said that the patient should eat foods that produce gas and wind, to inflate the abdomen and push the fracture outward.  We discourage this, lest it worsen any inflammation.  If there is no inflammation, it will not cause it. If it already exists, it will increase and exacerbate it.
Some suggest applying a cupping device to the area, then forcefully drawing it.  This seems logical, though one worries that the cupping device might draw more fluid to the area due to its weakness. Others say the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
The space between the ribs is filled, so that the ligament is smooth if wrapped around, then the patient is treated for a hernia, through diet and medicine.  If the patient is exhausted by the severe condition, he cannot bear it. The bone was piercing the diaphragm painfully, and we feared for the patient.  Therefore, we should incise the area, expose the fractured rib, then place the instrument that protects the peritoneum (as described previously) underneath, carefully cut the bone, and remove it.
Then we close the wound edges, if large, with sutures, and treat it with ointments until it heals.  If inflammation develops during this time, quickly apply poultices made from rose oil to the area, and treat the patient internally with something to reduce inflammation.
He should lie on the side where he sleeps more easily until he heals.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of the spine and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if fractured, this is rare.  More often, there is bruising.  The same is true for the vertebrae of the spine. If this occurs to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not... Then look: if you see that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and lifeless, and he cannot move, extend, or clench them; and if you pinch or prick them with a needle, he feels no sensation or pain, then know that in most cases, he will not recover; he is doomed.
But if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking, know that the marrow of the bone is intact, and the patient will recover with treatment. If the spine is injured in the same way, and you wish to know whether it will also recover or not...
Then look at his legs.  If you see that they are relaxed and the same condition as the hands has occurred, and then when he lies on his back, wind and stool come out involuntarily, and when he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily... And if he lies on his back and tries to urinate, he cannot.  Then know that he is doomed, so do not concern yourself with treating him. If none of this happens to him, the matter is less serious.  The treatment for what has occurred is to attempt to relieve the hot swelling.
By placing rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks, on the affected vertebrae three times a day, until the hot swelling subsides.  Then apply one of the strengthening, dry dressings to the area and bind it with a bandage.  Instruct him to rest and remain still.
He should sleep only on the side where he feels no pain until he recovers. If a splinter or something similar has formed at the site of the injury, the skin should be cut open and the bone fragment removed. Then, if the wound is large, bring the edges together with stitches and treat with healing ointments until healed. If the last bone of the coccyx is broken, then the little finger of the left hand should be inserted into the rectum.
Then, the broken bone should be aligned as much as possible with the other hand.  After alignment, apply a bandage and splint if necessary, and then bind it.
If you sense a broken splinter within, cut open the area and remove it. Treat the wound with the previously described treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a broken hip.
The bones of the hips rarely break. If they do, the break typically involves fragmentation at the ends, a longitudinal crack, and inward tilting. The patient experiences pain, pricking, and numbness in the affected leg.
To set it, run your hand over it until you grasp the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, adjust the ends to resemble their normal shape.
If the fracture is longitudinal or has tilted inward, lay the patient on his stomach so you can adjust the fracture. Once adjusted, apply a bandage and then a splint of wood or leather, securing it tightly.
Do not fear displacement of the fracture or the splint coming loose.  Fill any hollows in the hips to create a smooth, even surface for the splint.  Tell the patient to sleep on their back or healthy side.  If a hot swelling develops, treat it.
Refrain from stretching or manipulating it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply appropriate remedies as described previously.  Then resume adjusting and securing the splint as needed. If fragments or splinters of bone are found at the ends, do not remove them.
Do not touch the affected area, but adjust it from the outside as previously mentioned.  Leave it secured until healed.
Chapter Eleven.
On setting a fractured humerus.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, set it using one of two methods. One method is to take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness, like this:
Tie ligaments to both ends of the stick, then suspend it from a high point.  The patient sits in a chair, and then places their broken arm over the stick, so that their armpit is positioned at the center of the stick's curve.  Then, hang a heavy object from above.
Or, an attendant stretches it downwards, and then the physician straightens the fracture with their hands until the fracture is restored properly. The other method is for the patient to lie on their back, and their arm is suspended from their neck by a bandage.
Then, order two attendants to hold, one with his hands, the part above the fracture, and the other, the part below it, and each stretches it towards their respective sides.  If you want the stretching to be stronger, tie a bandage below the fracture and another above, and each attendant pulls towards their side.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, the bandage should be placed under the armpit and the other one below the fracture, near the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, the bandage should be placed at that location and at the elbow itself.
Then, gently straighten the fracture without force, until it is properly aligned and fits well. Then, tie it tight, unless a hot swelling appears. If a hot swelling appears, refrain from tightening it until the seventh day. Apply moistened cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil to it.
Until the swelling subsides.  Then, tighten it.  The method of tightening is to place the bandage on the fracture, then wrap a fresh cloth around the bandage.  Then, bring the arm to the upper arm, and place the hand open on the shoulder.
Hold the cloths and tightening on the upper arm and forearm so that the arm acts as a splint, if nothing prevents you from doing so and nothing changes about the fractured bone.  If you fear that something may change about it, then use splints.
It is to place a splint on the fracture itself, one wider and stronger than the other splints.  Let there be a finger's width between each splint.  The length of the splints should be according to the fracture, with an additional three fingers on each side.
Then, tighten the splints with the tightening described in the first section.
It is that your tightening should be stronger at the fracture site.
And the further from the fracture, the less the tightening. If you see the application of splints and tightening as we have mentioned in the time of your setting of the limb, then do so.
And if you fear a hot swelling, leave the tightening and splints until the seventh day, as we have said.  Then examine the ligament every three days, lest a burning sensation, swelling, or the cessation of nourishment to the limb from excessive tightening occurs.  Then rectify all of that according to what we have mentioned.
If you are confident that none of that will happen, do not loosen the bandage until after many days. The patient should lie on their back, their hand on their stomach, and a padded, moderate-sized arm sling of wool should be placed under the arm.
And examine at all times, night or day, lest the fractured limb's shape shifts or the bandage loosens. Correct all of this with your effort, and ensure the patient's diet is as we previously mentioned, that the food is initially gentle, until the bone is to solidify.
Then one should increase the strength of their diet, for it is customary for the arm and leg to strengthen in forty days.  At that time, the bandage should be loosened, baths should be taken, and remedies applied for that purpose.  If the fracture is severe and extensive.
Do not remove the bandage until fifty days, or even two months.
Chapter Twelve.
In the setting of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, and they are called radii. One is small, and it is the one next to the thumb, and the other is large, and it is positioned beneath the smaller one from below.  Thus, the larger radius might break alone, or the smaller radius might break alone, or they might both break.
If the upper small radius is fractured, its setting is easier and its healing is quicker.  If the lower radius is fractured, the fracture is bad, and healing is difficult.  The worst case is when both bones are fractured. If the upper small radius was fractured...
Then the physician must, in setting it, make the pulling gentle and slight to align it.  If the larger radius is fractured, the pulling should be stronger.  If both radii are fractured, the pulling must be very strong.
The hand should be positioned, during setting and pulling, extended on a cushion.  The thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers. The injured person should be seated.
The cushion should be at a height so as not to cause the patient any exertion.
Then, an assistant supports the arm from below, either by hand or with a bandage, and another assistant supports it from above.  Then the physician aligns the bone, returning it to the best possible shape. If the fracture has splinters, they should be removed.
Return each splinter to its place with all your effort. If a splinter appears detached, piercing the skin, and there is no hope of setting it, cut it open and remove it, as described above. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate section is dedicated to it.
If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of the setting, apply a cloth soaked in rose-infused ointment, made with white wax and rosin, of a medium thickness. Apply the cloth with gentle pressure until the swelling subsides.
Remove the ointment cloth and apply a dressing prepared from mill dust mixed with egg white. Then apply splints. The splint for the fracture itself should be slightly wider and stronger.  Know that, in most cases, six splints will be needed for the arm.
The fracture could be in one forearm bone or both.  Then, apply stronger traction to the fracture site.  The further the traction extends up or down the arm, the gentler the traction should be, as previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
The cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not overly stiff.  The thread used for tying should be linen, of medium thickness as described before.  Check the limb and ligaments after several days.
If a problem arises, such as irritation of the limb, it should be bathed in warm water until the irritation subsides. Leave the limb unstrapped overnight to allow rest, and then resume traction.
If the traction has become loose, and the bone has shifted or similar, rectify it with all your effort.  Also, if the limb is not receiving nourishment due to excessive traction, you should loosen it somewhat, leave it for several days to allow nourishment to flow, and then re-apply traction.
If the patient experiences none of the problems mentioned, the dressing should not be removed until twenty days or so.  Then, suspend the patient's arm around his neck, keeping the arm straight.  He should avoid strenuous movement, and sleep on his back.
Know that this arm fracture is set within thirty, or thirty-two, days, and perhaps in twenty-eight days, all depending on the individual's constitution and strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On setting the fracture of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpals of the hand and the phalanges of the fingers rarely fracture, but are often injured.  So, when a fracture or injury occurs to the hand...
The patient should sit in a crouched position, with a chair in front of him at a level height.
Then he places his hand on it, outstretched, and the attendant extends the fractured bones, and the physician straightens them until they are well-aligned. Then, if no hot swelling occurs, a bandage and splints should be applied; then a splint is to be placed over the area.
And it should be wrapped in soft cloth. If the fracture is towards the palm of the hand, make a ball shape from cloth, and instruct the patient to grip it with his fractured hand, then secure it with a long cloth.
Let the splint be made of soft leather so that the skin may heal along with the curvature of the entire hand, and secure it as needed. If the fracture is outward, then a splint should be placed on top and another splint underneath in the hand to maintain the hand open and upright.
Then, the bandage is applied as the hand rotates, and the fingers are bound together with a bandage. If the fracture is on one of the fingers, if it is the thumb, then it should be straightened and secured with the hand. Or, if desired, a small, upright splint may be used to support the fracture.
And he must not move. If the fracture is to any of the other fingers, such as the middle, index, ring, or pinky finger, it should be straightened and tied to the adjacent, healthy finger, or all the fingers should be tied together.  This is better.  Or a small upright splint can be placed on them.
As we said about the thumb, and examine during and after the setting of the fracture, and address any inflammatory swelling that arises, according to the previously described method.
Chapter Fourteen.
In setting a fractured thigh.
The thigh bone often breaks and is easily felt because it moves back and forth.  It is set by applying a bandage above the fracture and another below the fracture, with the patient lying on their face.
Then each attendant stretches the bandage in their direction to equalize it, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.  But if it is near the origin of the thigh, a soft bandage, either of wool or similar material, should be used.
At the origin of the thigh, towards the pubic area, the pull should be upward, and the other bandage below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee, with the pull downward. Then the physician should align the bone with both hands until it is restored to its natural shape.
The bone will heal well.  Then, the bandage and pressure should be maintained unless the limb develops a hot swelling. If swelling does occur, leave it for several days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to treatment.
As for the pressure, a wide, firm bandage should be wrapped around the fracture twice or three times, leaving excess material. Then, the leg should be wrapped until the heel is at the origin of the thigh.  A long thread should be inserted between the thigh and the leg, near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread should extend above on both sides.
Then, wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.  Then place splints on the thigh, at the site of the fracture itself, and make one splint on the leg bone.  Fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft cloths, so the pressure is equalized.
Then begin with firm pressure from the center on the fracture site, three or four wraps.  As the bandage moves away from the fracture site, the pressure should become less firm, softer, and looser.
Then, take the ends of the thread you inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie the adjacent splints above to it. Then, take the ends of the thread down to the heel of the leg, and also tighten the ends of the splints on the other side with them.
So that the bandage does not move from its place.  Then, maintain the pressure as long as no sores, swelling, or puffiness occur on the limb.  If any of this happens, quickly loosen it and repair whatever happened, as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a splinter in the bone that pierces the skin, you should smooth it out if possible. Otherwise, cut over it and remove it. Treat the wound as previously described until healed.  This fracture of the thigh may be treated without adding the leg with splints.
As we mentioned in the arm and forearm, except that setting it this way does not cause lameness for the patient.  If it is set alone, without being joined to the leg, the patient will invariably become lame.
Know that the thigh is set for fifty days, or a little more, or a little less, all depending on the variations in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
In the fracture of the kneecap.
The kneecap rarely fractures, but is often bruised. If it does fracture, it is either a split or a fragmentation of its parts, and this may occur with or without a wound.
Treatment depends on careful examination, and involves aligning the fractured pieces with the fingers until they are joined together, according to the ability to carefully and gently reposition them. Then, apply a bandage and a circular splint if necessary.
Then, apply further binding that corresponds to this, and then all cases described previously for other fractures, such as a hot swelling, are treated, addressing each symptom appropriately until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
In setting fractures of the leg.
The leg has two bones; one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the ulna.  They are susceptible to the same types of fractures as the arm bones. Therefore, its setting is like that of the arm, and the procedure is the same.  If both bones are fractured, the leg is displaced in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is displaced forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured, especially from below, this is evident to you.
Therefore, use traction and straightening, and bind the splints accordingly, just as in the arm.  However, if the leg fracture is a severe one with many fragments, the traction should be less and gentler, and exert care in setting it.
There is something extra in the procedure for the leg compared to the arm.  After you have straightened the splints and completed all your work, take two pieces of juniper wood, used for smoothing the walls of rooms, or palm fronds, or something similar.
Choose pieces of moderate thickness, not thin, and have them the length of the leg, from the knee down.  Then wrap two layers of cloth around each, lengthwise. Place one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let them be from the knee to the bottom of the foot, then tie the pieces of wood in three places, at the ends and the middle. With this support, the leg will be prevented from tilting to the right or left and will be properly secured. A wooden trough may also be used along the length of the leg.
Place it [the trough/support] inside to prevent movement, especially if there is a wound accompanying the fracture.  Carefully examine the leg every day, closely observing for swelling or inflammation or any other such condition. If anything of that sort occurs, address it accordingly until it heals. The leg bone will be set in approximately thirty days.
Chapter Seventeen.
Fractures of the leg and fingers.
The heelbone is never fractured.  Leg bones may be fractured, and fingers are rarely fractured, but rather are more often bruised.
If a fracture of the leg bone occurs and you see the bones are overlapping, the patient should place their foot flat on the ground, standing as they normally would. Then, place your foot on the protruding bone and press down, straightening it.
Until the bones are in their proper places. Then, take the bandage and splint, placing a small, flat board with two flat ends underneath the sole of the foot.  Tightly bind the foot with cloth and anything else needed.
After three or four days, release the bandage.  You will find the bones are straight, whether they were fractured or dislocated. The treatment is as described.  If some of the fingers are broken, realign and straighten them as described in the treatment for finger fractures.
Then make a splint for the fractured finger, extending the length of the finger and slightly wider than it.  Place the board, which I described earlier, under the foot, and bind it tightly.  If two, three, or more bones are fractured.
Make a splint for each finger, sized accordingly, and wrapped in soft cloth. Secure the board beneath the foot, and position each end of the board extending beyond the sole of the foot to provide proper support.
You should not forget to apply all that we have described regarding fractures and treat each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
Fractures of the woman's pubic bone and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, position her squatting, then gently lean her back slightly, supporting her from behind.  Then, the midwife should pack her vulva with cotton until it is full, like a ball.
Then, have the woman shake and lift her pelvis slightly, and the cotton will come out until it forms a ball at the entrance of the vulva, and the fracture will be healed.  Then place a support on her back.  When she wishes to urinate, remove the cotton gently so she may urinate.
Return it to its original position, as it was inserted initially, then return to the initial support.  Do this for seven days or so, and it will heal.  If you wish, take a sheep's bladder, attach a short tube to its opening, and place the entire bladder inside her vulva.
Then, blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, and the fracture will return.  Then pack it with cotton and maintain the described care for the necessary number of days until healed.  And if the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, this method is used to heal it.
And the treatment is the same as described for the hip bone.  The correct approach to these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, is clear to you, especially if you possess some expertise and understand my book well.  Indeed, the fracture itself will often guide you.
For correct treatment, understand the method of applying pressure for healing.  Regarding a fractured penis in a man, take a goose's esophagus, insert the penis into it, and then place a bandage made of cloth over it and bind it tightly.  Leave it for three days or so until healed.
Chapter Nineteen.
On setting fractures of bones if there is a wound.
If a fracture is accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus, or similar, one should immediately perform venesection if the conditions for it, as previously described, permit.
If the wound bleeds, you should immediately cauterize it with pulverized alum if nothing else is available.  Then, proceed with setting the fracture on that same day and do not delay.
If no hot swelling occurs, if a hot swelling does occur, then postpone setting the fracture until the ninth day, until the hot swelling subsides. Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for it exposes one to unfavorable symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin, exposed, then you should gently and carefully attempt to return it to its proper position and smooth it out with your hands, with a slight stretching motion.  If you cannot return it and smooth it with your hands, return it with this instrument, which is an instrument made of iron, seven or eight fingers in length. And its width should match the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of these, according to the treatment needed for each type of fracture.  Let them be rounded, with a slight thickness so they will not bend when used.
And they should be sharp at the ends, with a bend at one end. The top should be thick, and thinner from the middle to the bottom.  This is its image/form:.
It is called in Greek "perem," meaning a small lever.  The sharp, bent end should be placed on the protruding bone end and pushed with it once.  When the bone is returned and somewhat positioned, then the broken ends are carefully aligned.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, then the end of that bone should be cut so that the instrument can hold it. If the bone cannot be repositioned as described, then cut it with a similar tool as we have mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws, as best you can. Then, remove any remaining roughness or thin scales from the bone.  If, after repositioning the bone, the patient experiences severe, painful discomfort, know that the bone has not returned to its proper position.
If you can reposition it to its natural position, do so, as you will greatly benefit the patient.  When the bone setting is complete, soak a cloth in a dark, astringent liquid, especially if it is summer. Do not apply lint or anything oily to the wound.
So that putrefaction and decay do not occur. Then, use splints when you are finished setting the bone. Leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole in the bandages, using scissors, to the size of the wound.
Beware, with great caution, of tightening the wound with the fracture. Often, the ignorant physicians do this, causing their patients either death or an ulcer or a cold. Let your tightening be gentle and relaxed, unlike the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or if it is a large wound, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we described, and if the patient experiences disturbing pain in the area, you should not apply splints. Instead, make bandages of strong cloths in the place of splints and tighten them.
If, after a day or two, you see pus starting to form in the wound, remove the cloth soaked in the liquid that you placed on it.  Then use the bandages and ointments that we customarily use to treat wounds, like the four-ingredient ointment, etc.  You should loosen the bandage.
Examine the wound every evening and morning until it heals and is cured.  You should position the limb so that pus drains downwards easily. If the wound takes many days to heal, and the pus does not stop, know that there are small pieces of bone fragments.
You should probe the wound with a probe. Any bone fragments that have come loose, remove them.  If any remain lodged and are causing pain, cut through them and remove them by any means possible.
If the wound develops a cold, or ulceration, or another form of decay or putrefaction, you should counter each symptom with the corresponding treatment described in its section.
If a large, prominent bone such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar large bones, are broken, do not attempt to pull it out or remove it. Often death results from this.  Leave it until it rots; perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
On treating the complications that arise after some fractures.
This complication often arises after the fracture has healed, especially near the joints.  It disfigures the limb and may prevent the limb from its natural function.
If the complication is fresh, use astringent medications such as myrrh, frankincense, aloes, acacia, and similar ones, by taking some or all of these and mixing them with an astringent drink or egg white or vinegar.
Apply this to the complication, firmly bandaging it.  Leave the bandage for many days, then remove it and apply another until the swelling goes away, God willing; or apply a tight lead plate.
Lead has the property of removing any swelling in the limbs.  If the swelling has hardened and become severe, and necessity demands its removal, cut it open from above, and remove the protruding excess or scrape it with instruments until it disappears, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In treating a fracture, if the limb, after being set, remains thin and not as its original form.
If a fractured bone is set and the limb remains thin and weak, this is due to many reasons. One reason is either excessive loosening and improper tying of the ligaments, or excessive tightening of the ligaments preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or excessive and improper use of splints; or excessive movements at improper times; or insufficient and weak blood supply in the patient's body.
Treatment for this includes nourishing the patient and enriching his body so that the blood increases, using baths, bringing joy and happiness, and similar measures.  Then, applying pitch to the limb to draw nourishment, or continuing to splint it with lukewarm water. Until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-two.
On treating fractured bones that are forcibly straightened and prevented from functioning properly.
If, after the healing of a limb that has been set, a crookedness or projection of the fractured bone appears or the limb is deformed and disfigured. However, if the limb has not been prevented from its natural function, one should not accept the claim of those who assert that the limb should be broken from its head, as many ignorant physicians and setters do in our country.
This action is highly reprehensible and leads to great risk, at best resulting in injury. But if the crookedness and deformity are recent, then it should be treated with water in which relaxing herbs such as the leaves, roots, and crown imperial, and the like, have been boiled.
And it should be bandaged with relaxing bandages, such as well-crafted diachylon, or the juice of the root of the plantains should be taken, mixed with chicken fat and she-camel fat, and bandaged with it, or thick figs should be pounded with pigeon droppings and similar medications called resolvents.
And the deformity may be resolved by continuous, gentle massage with the hands, and the limb should be moved in every direction at all times.  If the crookedness has progressed, intensified, and become hard, and the necessity arises to treat it with iron.
Then the affected area should be split open, the bone connection released, and any excess deformity or bone cut away with fine incisions.  Care and diligence should be used in this process.  Then the wound should be treated with the previously mentioned methods until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is a dislocation of a joint from its place, hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing the afflicted intense pain and suffering.  If a person experiences a dislocated jaw, they should promptly attempt to realign it.
Delaying treatment is absolutely forbidden.  If delayed, the affected area will swell, and a tumor will form, making jaw realignment difficult.  Therefore, one should not delay, nor move nor stretch the jaw while it is swollen, as this often results in painful spasms and suffering for the patient.
However, if this occurs, one should first bleed the patient, then wait until the swelling subsides somewhat.  Then, apply warm water and ointment to the limb.  Then, gently realign the jaw, and treat each affected area as described in its respective location.
The chapters on the jaw are also arranged according to what was previously discussed regarding fractures, from the upper to the lower body.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On treating the lower jaw.
The jaws rarely become dislocated, and their displacement occurs in one of two ways: either they slip slightly from their positions and relax somewhat, or they completely dislocate and relax entirely. To the extent of the chest, so that the patient's saliva drips and he cannot contain it, nor can he close his jaw or speak, articulating his tongue.  However, if the dislocation is slight, it will in most cases return to its place with the least effort.
However, if the dislocation is complete, it is necessary to quickly return it, and not delay at all.  A servant should hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the root of the jaw within the patient's mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
Or, if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, the physician should insert both thumbs, and the rest of their fingers from outside, to adjust the jaw.  The physician instructs the patient to relax and open their jaw completely, and while the patient moves the jaw in all directions, the physician adjusts and pushes it back into place.
If it is difficult to return them, especially if both jaws are dislocated, use warm water and ointment compresses to make returning them easier. Do not delay their return, as we have said.  If they have returned to their proper position, the patient's mouth is closed, and they are not relaxed, then place bandages with a mixture of wax and rose ointment on them.
Then gently tie with a loose bandage. The patient should sleep on their back, with their head propped up between two pillows, so that they do not move it to the right or left, and do not attempt to chew anything. Their food should be soft and easily swallowed.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is healed, the patient may eat whatever they like.  They should use gentle care, and not force their mouth open for eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw is healed.
If the jaws are difficult to return to their proper position after dislocation, there is often fever, persistent headache, and the patient's stomach may be upset and they may vomit repeatedly.  If you see this, know that the condition is serious.
Often, those who experience this condition for ten days die.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On repositioning the clavicle and shoulder joint.
The clavicle does not dislocate from the inside due to its connection to the chest.  It may dislocate outwards, and this is apparent to the touch.  To reduce it, the patient should lie on their back and extend their arms.
Then, press the area firmly with your hand; this will reposition it.  Then apply a bandage and splints, securing them.  The part of the clavicle adjacent to the shoulder rarely dislocates.  If it does, it should be repositioned as described, using whatever method is available.
Then apply a bandage, splints, and dressings, and instruct the patient to remain still and quiet until healed.  Using this same treatment, the shoulder joint can also be repositioned if it becomes dislocated.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In reducing a shoulder dislocation.
Know that the shoulder joint dislocates in three ways: one is downward toward the armpit, the second is toward the chest, and the third, rarely, is upward towards the shoulder.
It does not dislocate behind the shoulder blade, nor in front of the nerve.  Most often, it dislocates and comes out downward toward the armpit, especially in those with thin musculature, because it emerges and re-enters quickly in them.
However, in those with thick musculature, it is the opposite; it emerges and re-enters with difficulty.  Sometimes, a person suffers a blow or a fall and the shoulder swells, with a hot, inflamed lump, and they suspect it is dislocated. Therefore, it is necessary to examine this thoroughly to determine its true state.
Then, in treating it, if the dislocation is downward toward the armpit, when you compare the dislocated shoulder to the healthy one, you will find a visible difference.  You will find a prominence on the head of the dislocated shoulder, and under the armpit, when palpated, the head of the shoulder feels like an egg.
And the patient will not be able to raise their arm to their ear, nor perform any other arm movements.  Similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upward, this will be evident on palpation.
This dislocation may be easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  To reduce it, have an attendant raise the arm upward. Then, place your thumbs under the armpit and lift the joint forcefully upward to its proper position.  The attendant should raise and extend the arm upward.
Then bring it downward, and it will return quickly.  However, if it does not return as described, and the dislocation has been present for a considerable time, the patient should take a warm bath and use remedies that relax and soften the muscles.  Examples include cooked fennel, fenugreek, and king's crown in water.
Then, the patient lies on their back, and a ball of moderately soft wool is placed under their armpit.  The physician then positions their heel on the ball, and grasps the patient's arm, extending it downward.
And the physician pushes the ball with their foot, and the arm will return to its place.  Or, if you prefer, another method is to have a taller person stand beside the patient, positioning their shoulder under the patient's armpit.  Then they raise the patient's arm upward so that the patient is suspended in the air. And another attendant pulls the patient's arm downward towards their abdomen. If the patient is light, something should be attached to weigh them down.  This will cause the arm to return immediately.  And the dislocation may also be reduced in another way.
Another method is to place a long, round-headed piece of wood on the ground, similar to the pestle head of a mortar, neither thick nor thin.  A soft cloth is placed on top of the wood.  The patient stands along the length of the wooden rod, with the rod placed under their armpit.
Then the patient extends their hand downward on the other side, and also extends their body forcefully on the other side. The joint will quickly return to its proper place.  If, despite all the methods described, the reduction is difficult, use this treatment: take a piece of wood approximately two cubits long. And its width is about four fingers, and its thickness about two fingers.  It should have a rounded head, so that it can easily enter the armpit in this way.
Then a soft cloth is tied to the rounded head to prevent the wood from injuring the patient.  The wood is placed under the armpit. The entire arm and forearm are extended along the wood downward. The wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a support beam.  The hand is extended downward, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side. The joint will then return to its place.  Once the joint has been reduced in any way possible, a moderately-sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then, a dressing prepared from mill dust, frankincense, and egg white, is applied to the entire shoulder, wrapping around from above.  The ball is firmly secured under the armpit, and the bandage is wrapped around the dressing from above.  The patient's arm is suspended from their neck.
The patient's arm is left undisturbed for seven days.  The patient's diet should be light to strengthen the affected limb, as this speeds recovery.  After seven days, or five, the bandage is removed, and the patient is encouraged to move the limb. If the limb is firm and doesn't relax, then healing is complete.
If the joint repeatedly dislocates due to moisture or another cause, cauterization with three layers of thin cloth should be used, as described in the chapter on cauterization.  If all of this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the joint still does not remain stable,
If the dressing and binding are repeated several times but the joint does not hold, and it slips and relaxes, and the patient is unable to raise the limb, then know that the nerve in the head of the shoulder has been severed, stretched, or relaxed.  Understand then that the joint will never remain in place.
For a dislocated jaw, near the chest and breast, and behind, reposition it by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns.  All binding and treatment should be applied until it heals. If, after healing, there is a sensation of stiffness in the limb and slow movement,
The patient should use a bath repeatedly until the stiffness subsides and returns to its original state.
The twenty-seventh chapter.
On the treatment of a dislocated elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty. It dislocates in all directions, particularly forward or backward.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, since it is apparent to sight and touch, no matter how it has dislocated.
When the dislocated elbow is placed alongside the healthy one, its dislocation becomes clearly apparent by the depression in the joint. The arm cannot be bent, and the shoulder cannot be brought to it.  One must act quickly and relocate the dislocation before a hot swelling occurs.
If a hot swelling appears, relocation becomes difficult, and it may never heal.  Especially if the dislocation is backward, this is the worst type of dislocation, the most painful, and often results in death.
To reduce it, if it is reducible, a servant should extend his arm fully with both hands, and the physician's hands should be placed above and below the elbow.  He should push the joint back into place with both thumbs or the base of his hands.
If the dislocation is forward, the hand may be bent once until the base of the palm strikes the shoulder it faces.  If the dislocation does not return, use very strong and forceful extension, achieved by two servants extending the arm.
Two servants also hold the patient to prevent movement during the extension.  Then the arm is rotated in all directions after wrapping a folded cloth or wide bandage around it.  If the physician manipulates the joint with his hands, he should first lubricate it with ointment to facilitate the smooth movement of the joint.
Then the joint is pushed firmly until it returns to place.  After it returns, the injured area should be bandaged with a compress containing a drying agent mixed with egg white. The bandage should be applied tightly and the arm should be suspended from the patient's neck for several days.
Then it is removed.  If the joint is firmly in place, remove the bandage and leave it.  If you see that the joint has not solidified, reapply the bandage and leave it for several days until it does strengthen.  Then remove the bandage.  If there is swelling after the joint has returned and been bandaged.
If movement is difficult, use warm baths, gentle massage, and kneading until it becomes supple.  Or, place a thick, fat lamb's fleece over the joint, bandage it, and leave it in place for a day and a night.  Then remove it and take the patient to a warm bath.  If the patient sweats, gently massage the joint.
Then repeat the fleece application and warm bath three times until the joint becomes flexible. If you prefer, apply dampened, finely ground cow hide mixed with ghee, and apply it several times. This will also soften the joint and return it to its normal condition.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints, but it is essential to quickly reduce the dislocation at the time of its occurrence, before inflammation or a hot swelling develops in the area.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board, have an attendant extend the patient's arm, and the physician should place his hand over the bony prominence of the joint and push until it returns. However, it is necessary to check if the dislocation has gone towards the palm of the hand.
Let the patient place their palm on the board when extending and reducing.  If the dislocation is outwards (on the back of the hand), then let the patient's palm be on the board so the physician's hand falls upon the same bony prominence of the joint.  If it returns immediately, then do so; otherwise, apply a bandage that soothes the inflammation.
Leave it alone, do not repeat the procedure; it cannot withstand it, and you cannot reduce it after days have passed, except that the joint will remain deformed and will not harm the patient, unless the hand weakens and cannot grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve is severed or bruised, and there is no remedy for it except to treat with cautery. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it does not.  Once the wrist is reduced, apply the bandage we described, then tightly bind it and leave it for five days.
Then, it is released, and the hand is exercised.  If its movement is difficult and something painful is present, soften it with heated water and rubbing repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction.  If a finger dislocates to the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumb until it returns to its place. Then bandage the fingertip and support it towards the direction in which it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it stands straight that day.  If it is nighttime, bandage it in the same way. Continue to release it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bandage it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Likewise, do the same if it dislocates to the palm of the hand; bandage it towards the same direction and follow your initial procedure until it is healed. Do likewise if it dislocates to any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
On treating the dislocation of the spine.
When a vertebra in the spine or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae have been displaced from their positions, there is no treatment because death quickly comes to the afflicted.
A sign of this is that the afflicted's stool comes out involuntarily, and he cannot retain it. Often, some of his limbs, either his legs or arms, or one of them, become relaxed.  If a single vertebra is displaced, it often gets displaced.
Its displacement can occur in four directions.  That which moves backward is called a hump.  Its treatment is that you should observe; if the hump was caused by childhood disease, there is no treatment for it, and no recovery whatsoever.  However, if it was caused by a fall, injury, or something similar...
The ancients described various treatments with lengthy explanations, much of which is ultimately of little use.  I have condensed this to what is sufficient, avoiding much of their lengthy explanations and descriptions. I have depicted the mechanism differently from what they explained.
I say that a hump occurring in the front of the chest has no cure, nor recovery.  The same applies to those occurring to the sides.  Only those occurring in the back are treatable, specifically by the method I am describing:  have the afflicted lie on their face.
On a flat platform near a wall, spread a damp cloth underneath to avoid injuring his chest. Then place a vertical board, planted in a hole in the ground, near his head at one edge of the platform, and another board near his feet at the other edge of the platform.
A servant holds one board, ensuring it's not firmly fixed in the hole, and another servant holds the other in the same manner.  Then a soft, strong bandage is wrapped around the patient's chest and under their armpits.  The end of the bandage is extended to the board near the patient's head and tied to it.
Then, a second bandage is tightened around his hips, knees, and ankles.  All the bandages are gathered and tied to the other board, near the patient's feet.  Each servant pulls the board towards their side with the bandage, and the boards remain in their embedded positions.
However, the boards are not secured, as we said. The physician places his hands firmly on the hump until it returns, or places a board on top of it, and then leans on the board with his feet until the hump returns.  If this treatment does not work, take a board about three cubits long.
A cavity is carved into the wall, which we mentioned should be near the patient, where the end of the board can be inserted. Then, the middle of the board is placed on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end, pulling firmly to apply pressure to the hump.
It will return to its place. If you wish, create this using a hand-wound torsion spring by placing two boards, each a cubit long, in the ground at the head of the patient, and another two at their feet, at the far end of the stall.
Let there be a span between each board.  A hole is made in each board, through which the torsion spring passes. The boards are firmly secured to the ground so that they do not move at all. A twisted stick, the torsion spring, is inserted, with the bandage being wound in the holes of both boards.
At its end is a hole secured by a stick a span long, twisted accordingly. The same is done with the other two boards. Then, the bandage tightened at the patient's chest is attached to the torsion spring at their head, and the bandages tightened on the patient's legs are attached to the torsion spring at their feet.
Then a servant stands by each torsion spring, twisting the spring with the twisting tool, while the physician adjusts the hump as previously described. This is a depiction of the torsion spring, the stall, and the patient.
Then, after the vertebrae return to their proper place and the area is aligned, the dried bandage should be applied, first with egg white, then with a plaster.  A splint made of wood, about three fingers wide, and long enough to cover the hump, should then be placed over the bandage.
And on some sound bead, then it is tied with the appropriate bandage. The patient should use soft food until recovery. If some protrusion remains in the area after healing, then the softening and relaxing medicines should be used, along with the splint described for a long time.
A lead sheet may also be used in this case.  A protrusion may appear in the final vertebrae of the back, which may be mistaken for a dislocation.  It could be an extra bone that has protruded.  Do not subject it to this treatment, as death may result.
Chapter Thirty-one.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and are not subject to the slight displacement and deformity that afflicts other joints.  The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
This is because it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward.  It dislocates inward most often, and rarely forward or backward.  A sign of dislocation inward is that if you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected leg, the healthy leg will be longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will not be able to bend their leg at the groin.  The area below the groin will be swollen and noticeably distended, indicating that the head of the thigh has moved there.
The signs of dislocation outward are the opposite of these signs.  The sign of dislocation forward is that the leg is fully extended but cannot be bent without pain in the knee, and if attempting to walk, the patient cannot move forward.
The patient will have urinary retention and groin pain.  When walking, the patient will place the heel on the ground.  The sign of dislocation backward is that the knee cannot be straightened or bent before bending the groin, and the leg will also be shorter than the other.
The groin is relaxed, and the head of the thigh is clearly visible near the hip.  As for the reduction of these dislocations: observe.  If the dislocation is old and has persisted without attempts at reduction, there is no treatment at all.
Therefore, it should not be attempted.  As for a recent dislocation, regardless of the four types of dislocation, quickly manipulate the joint, extending it inward and outward, and moving it left and right.  Perhaps...
If it returns without further treatment, then if it does not return this way, a strong, capable assistant should hold the leg from below, either with their hands or with a bandage tied above the knee, and another assistant should pull from above.
By inserting their hands under the armpits, and then applying a soft bandage to the root of the thigh, and a third assistant holding the end of the bandage, pulling either from the front, from the groin towards the collarbone, or from behind, towards the back.
All the assistants should pull simultaneously until the patient rises from the ground and hangs suspended.  This type of traction is common to all four types. If the dislocation is reduced as described, otherwise, each type requires its specific treatment.
For its specific reduction, if the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on their healthy side, then a bandage should be placed on the root of the thigh, between the head of the thigh and the area beneath the groin.
Then, the bandage is pulled upward from the groin toward the upper body and collarbone.  A strong assistant then grasps the thick part of the affected thigh with both arms and pulls forcefully outward; this will return it to its proper position.
This method is easier than other methods for reducing this limb. If this type of treatment is unsuccessful, then you should bind the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage around the heels and knees.
Each should be a distance of about four fingers from its companion, and the affected leg should be extended farther than the other by about two fingers.  The patient should then be suspended from the head by a wooden beam in the house, a distance of approximately two arms from the ground.
Then, a strong servant is instructed to grasp the head of the thigh while another servant is to support the patient; the servant grasping the thigh should push with force. The joint will quickly return to its place.  As for its specific reduction, if the dislocation is outward...
The patient should lie on a raised surface, as described in the case of a hump, and the bandage is tightened on the affected leg, specifically around the chest.  Then, one plank is placed by the patient's feet, and another by the head, and an additional plank is placed firmly in the middle of the raised surface.
Wet cloths should be wrapped around it to prevent injury to the patient.  The plank should be placed between the patient's thighs, to prevent downward movement during stretching.  Then each attendant should pull in their direction, and the physician should adjust the hip with their hands, if it returns to its place.
Otherwise, place the board on him, and compress as described for the hump, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side.  If the dislocation is forward, the affected leg should be extended once while in this same position on the raised surface.
The physician places the right hand on the affected hip and presses it with the other hand.  At the same time, the pressure should be extended downward toward the knee. If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be stretched downward.
He is elevated from the ground, but should be placed on a firm surface.  Also, the hip and knee should be outward, as described in his position on the raised surface, lying on his face, with the bandages tightened.
As we said earlier, compression with the board should also be used on the area where the joint has dislocated.  Once the hip joint returns correctly, a sign of its return, which should be clear to you, is that the patient's leg extends.
If you see them even and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned correctly.  Then, join the thighs, apply the bandage, and secure it with a turban in such a way that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain at rest for three or four days. Then, loosen the bandage and bandage, and compare the legs.  If you find them equal in size, know that the fracture has set. Release the patient to walk. If you notice any weakness, however.
Return and bandage it, tightening as you did at first. Leave it for three days, then loosen it.  Let the patient walk slowly for several days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On the treatment of a fractured knee.
The knee fractures in three ways: inwards, outwards, and downwards (i.e., backwards).  It does not fracture forwards.  A sign of a fracture is to ask the patient to draw the leg towards the thigh.
If the leg does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is fractured.  The method of reduction for all types of fractures is that the patient sit with legs extended, if able.  A servant sits behind him, holding his waist and gently bending it backwards.  Then, you sit on his thighs.
Then, place your back against his, and put his leg between your legs.  Then grasp his knee with both hands, interlacing your fingers on his knee. Then, press firmly with both hands on the sides of his knee. Another attendant should extend the leg until the knee returns to its place.
The sign that it has returned to its place is that the leg adheres to the thigh, softly and without force. Then bandage it, and fasten the leg to the thigh, and bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.  Only minimal walking should be permitted for several days until strength returns.
If you cannot return it using the methods described, then use strong traction with the bandages described previously for treating the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may be dislocated slightly, or completely.  Dislocation may be inward or outward.  A sign of dislocation is to see the heel swollen and prominent on the side to which it has dislocated.
As for treating a slight dislocation, it is easily returned by gently pulling with the hands and aligning it until it returns.  However, if it is completely dislocated, the patient should sit, and a strong assistant should hold it from behind the middle of the patient's back.
Then, with your right hand, grasp the foot from above, and with your left hand, grasp below the foot, at the heel.  Then pull the foot toward you with your right hand, then with your left hand, twice.  Then extend it with your left hand and push the front of the foot towards the leg with your right hand, without force.
Repeat this twice as described.  Then, on the third time, push the front of the foot towards the leg while pulling on the heel. If it returns in one or two attempts with this method and you see the foot is aligned, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the procedure; it will return.
If it does not return with the methods described, then lay the patient on their back on the ground, and firmly plant and secure a firmly fixed object in the ground, positioned between their legs. A cloth should be wrapped around it to prevent injury to the patient. Then, an assistant should hold the patient's thigh.
Then another assistant extends the leg, either with their hands or with a bandage tied around the patient's leg.  Each assistant should pull in the opposite direction, and the stake should be firmly positioned between the patient's legs to prevent the body from pulling downwards during the stretching. Then the physician straightens the joint with their hands.
Another assistant holds the healthy leg downwards.  If the joint returns quickly, then take the bandage and splint, and secure it with firm bandages. Bind the foot downwards with a bandage.  Care must be taken to avoid the nerve located behind the heel.
So that the bandage is not too tight and causes injury. Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it again. Then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should abstain from walking for forty days.
If the patient attempts to walk before this time, there is a risk that the joint will become dislocated and treatment will be unsuccessful. If a hot swelling appears, the methods previously described in other parts of the treatment and poultice section should be used to reduce it until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocated toes.
One should gently straighten the dislocated toe by a slight stretch, without force. This is not difficult but easy. If the dislocation is in one of the toes on the top of the foot, the patient should place their foot on a level surface.
Or, while standing as if walking, on a board.  Then place your foot on the protruding joints and press firmly with your foot until they return to their normal position and no protrusion is visible.
Then place a board under the sole of their foot, encompassing the entire foot and having two ends.  Bind it tightly for three days. Then release it and keep them from walking for many days until it strengthens and a recurrence is unlikely, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the types of dislocation that occurs with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both.
When something of this kind occurs and you attempt treatment and reduction, death frequently follows.
Therefore, one should not undertake the treatment of such a case unless they are skilled in the art, long-practiced, gentle, compassionate, cautious, and not rash or reckless.  In the beginning, they should only use remedies that soothe hot tumors and let the patient rest.
Except by God's grace, unless you hope for the patient's safe recovery with slight illness and some hope appears to you, then return it from the very beginning, before a hot tumor arises.
If the limb returns to its proper place, use the treatment that relieves hot tumors and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments.  If the jaw is fractured and splinters of bone have detached, remove them. Follow in this regard what we have mentioned regarding simple illnesses in their appropriate places previously.
Strive diligently and purify yourself from entering into a path of recklessness, as I have previously advised.  This will preserve your reputation and safeguard your standing, God willing.
