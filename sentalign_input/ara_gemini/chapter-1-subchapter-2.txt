The second chapter on cauterizing the head also.
If a chronic headache occurs and it lasts for the patient, and he has used eardrops, sternutatories, nasal instillations, ointments, and bandages, especially if he has been cauterized with the single cautery that we described, and none of that benefited him, then consider: If the patient's head is naturally strong in constitution, and he is not weak, and he feels intense cold, then cauterize him with another cautery slightly above that one.
Then cauterize him on each horn of his head with a cautery until the thickness of the skin disappears and the amount of bone we described is exposed.
And cauterize him with a cautery at the back of his head in the place known as the axe, and lighten your hand in this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will find it intensely painful, unlike the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
And I will mention this cautery in its place.
It is appropriate that the cautery iron used to cauterize the horns of the head and its back be gentler than the cautery iron used to cauterize the middle of the head.
