And the ancients called it "cure contuse," and it is that you shave the hair from the forehead of the patient who has this illness, then make three incisions in the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be about two fingers wide in the middle of the forehead, going down to the nose, and the other two at the sides above the eyelids, and beware of incising the arteries that are on the two sides above the eyelids; and keep your hand away from the juncture of the two mandibles, and let each wound be the width of three fingers joined together across; and have ready a piece of sponge and plenty of cloths to wipe the blood, then insert the pointed spatula on both sides, of which this is the form: from the incision that is towards the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two incisions with the rasp that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then remove this spatula.	You bid the patient shave the hair of his forehead; then you make three parallel incisions across his forehead a little apart; and let the length of each incision be two fingers' breadths; the first incision continuing the line of the nose in the middle of the forehead; and the second at a little distance from the temporal muscle; and the third incision on the other side of the forehead. Beware of cutting the two arteries which are at the sides, and keep your hand away from the mandibular joint; and let there be a distance between each incision as of three fingers joined. Have ready by you some pieces of sponge or a number of linen towels to wipe away the blood.	0.875265
