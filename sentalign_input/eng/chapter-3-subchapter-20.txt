 CHAPTER TWENTY.
On the treatment of the callus that remains from a fracture.
This callus often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially one near a joint, and thereby the shape of the limb is spoilt; and sometimes there is limitation of the natural function of the limb.
Examine it, and if the callus be soft, apply astringent remedies to it, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, balsam of sarcocol, acacia, and the like.
Take some or all of these; beat them up with a dry wine or egg-white or vinegar, apply to the callus on some tow and bind up firmly.
Leave the bandaging on for many days; then undo it and repeat until the callus is removed, God willing.
Or bind on it a firm sheet of lead; for lead has the property of taking away lumps from limbs.
But if the callus is stony hard and its removal is urgent, incise the place and cut away the superfluous prominence, or pare it away with a scraper until it is gone; and dress the wound until it heals.
