of the jaws
It rarely happens that both jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two ways: either they are slightly out of place and somewhat softened; or they are completely dislocated, and hang down toward the chest, and saliva runs from the mouth which he cannot hold, nor can he close his mouth, and he mumbles his speech.
When the dislocation is minor, it returns by itself in many cases.
And if it is complete and total, you must reduce it quickly, and do not delay; and in such a way that the assistant holds the patient's head, and the surgeon puts the bag of one of his hands at the root of the jaw dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on both sides; and the other two fingers are outside, to apply even pressure; and tell the patient to relax his jaws, and to move them in all directions.
And the surgeon sets it evenly, until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then moisten them with warm water and oil, until you reduce them easily; and do not delay in reducing them, as we have said.
And when they are reduced evenly, and the patient's mouth closes well without difficulty, then apply cloths soaked in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages; and let the patient sleep on his back, and his head be placed between two cushions, so that he does not move it to the right or left, and does not try to chew, but takes light food, until the pain is gone, and the jaws are strengthened; and then chews what he wants lightly, and does not strain to open his mouth to eat and drink, until the jaw is well strengthened and healed.
And if the two jaws cannot be reset at the same time, and are not returned to their places, fevers and sudden chills usually occur, and perhaps diarrhea, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is a dangerous situation; and often the one to whom it happens dies within nine days.
