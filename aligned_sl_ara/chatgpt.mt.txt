The author of this book said: When I completed this book for you, my sons, which is the portion of knowledge in medicine in its entirety and achieved the utmost clarity and elucidation in it, I saw fit to complete it for you with this treatise, which is the portion of work by hand.
Because manual work, in our land and time, is entirely absent to the point that its knowledge has nearly disappeared and its trace has almost vanished. Only a few traces remain in the writings of the ancients, which have been altered by hands, plagued by errors and confusion, so that their meanings have become obscure, and their benefit is distant.
I saw fit to revive it and to compose in it this treatise, following the path of explanation, clarification, and conciseness, and to provide images of cautery instruments and all other surgical tools, as this increases clarity and is among the essential needs.
The reason for the absence of skilled manual practitioners in our time is that the craft of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first train in the knowledge of anatomy as described by Galen. So that he may understand the functions of organs, their shapes, their temperaments, their connections and separations, as well as the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers, their exits, the pulsating and non-pulsating veins, and the locations of their exits.
This is why Hippocrates said that physicians in name are many, but in action are few, especially in the craft of surgery, and we have touched upon this in the introduction of this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have mentioned about anatomy is bound to fall into an error that may lead to the death of people, as I have often observed from those who pretend expertise in this field without knowledge or understanding.
For instance, I saw an ignorant doctor incise a scrofulous tumor on a woman's neck, severing some arteries in the neck, causing the woman to bleed until she collapsed, dead, before him.
I also saw another doctor proceed to remove a stone from an elderly man; the stone was large, and he acted recklessly, extracting it with a piece of the bladder tissue. The man died within three days; I had been summoned to remove it myself, and upon seeing the stone's size and the patient's condition, I had determined it was beyond my capability.
I also saw another doctor earning a living from one of the commanders in our land through medicine.
A black boy in his care had a broken leg near the heel, along with a wound, and in his ignorance, the doctor hastily bound the fracture tightly over the wound with splints and bandages, leaving no breathing space for the wound.
He then dismissed him without supervision, leaving him for several days and instructing him not to loosen the binding until his leg and foot swelled, bringing him to the brink of death.
I was summoned to him, and I promptly released the binding, bringing relief from his pain, but the infection had already taken hold of the limb, and I could not reverse it.
The infection continued to spread through the limb until he perished.
I saw another doctor who incised a cancerous tumor, which ulcerated after several days, causing great suffering to the patient, as when cancer is purely melancholic in nature, it should never be approached with a knife.
Unless it is in an organ that can be entirely removed.
Therefore, my sons, you should know that manual work is divided into two types: work accompanied by safety and work that brings harm in most cases.
I have pointed out throughout this book the procedures that entail risk and fear, so you should avoid and reject them.
So that the ignorant may not find reason to criticize, exercise caution and protection for yourselves, and gentleness and patience for your patients.
Follow the best path that leads to safety and favorable outcomes, and avoid dangerous, hard-to-cure diseases.
Distance yourselves from what you fear might bring suspicion upon your faith and worldly affairs, as this will preserve your honor and elevate your status in both this world and the hereafter.
Galen said in one of his counsels: Do not treat an ill-fated disease, lest you be named ill-fated physicians.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter.
On cauterization with fire and with caustic medication, organized from head to foot, with images of the instruments, cautery tools, and everything needed in manual work.
The second chapter.
On incision, opening, venesection, cupping, wounds, extracting arrows, and the like, all organized and arranged with images of the instruments.
The third chapter.
On bone-setting, dislocation, sprain treatment, and similar topics, organized from head to foot with images of the instruments.
The first chapter.
On cauterization.
Before we discuss its practice, we should mention its benefits and harms and the temperaments in which it is used.
I say that discussing the benefits and harms of cauterization is a lengthy topic, a precise science, and a subtle secret, which many wise men have discussed.
They have differed in opinion, and I have summarized some of their discourse to avoid lengthy elaboration.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for all bad temperaments, whether accompanied by substance or not, except in two temperaments: the hot temperament without substance and the dry temperament without substance.
As for the dry temperament with substance, they have differed in opinion; some said that cauterization is beneficial for it, while others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for a disease resulting from heat and dryness, as fire's nature is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to heal a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry remedy. But those who say the opposite claim that cauterization with fire may indeed benefit a hot, dry disease that occurs in human bodies. When you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you achieve a cold human body.
And I say as he said because experience has revealed this to me many times, but one should only attempt such matters if well-trained and thoroughly practiced in the field of cauterization. And he should understand the differences in human temperaments and the states of illnesses within themselves, their causes, symptoms, and durations.
As for other temperaments, you have no cause for concern, especially with cold and moist diseases, upon which all physicians agree and do not dispute the benefit of cauterization for them.
Know, my sons, that one of the secrets of treatment by fire cauterization and its superiority over cauterization with a burning medication is that fire is a singular essence whose effect does not extend beyond the cauterized organ nor does it harm a connected organ, except with minimal harm.
Cauterization with a burning medication can have its effect extend to other organs and may cause in the organ a disease difficult to treat, or even death, while fire, with its noble and pure essence, does not do so unless it is excessive.
This has become clear to us through experience, due to long service, diligence in the craft, and understanding the truths of the matter.
For this reason, I dispense with lengthy discussion, and if it were not unsuitable for this book, I would present you with an esoteric secret about fire and how it acts upon bodies and dispels diseases with philosophical and demonstrative discourse beyond your comprehension.
Know, my sons, that they have differed over the appropriate time for cauterization and have designated spring as the best time.
I say that cauterization may be suitable at any time, because the harm caused by the season is absorbed by the benefit derived from cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for urgent, severe, and advancing pains that cannot be delayed, for fear it may lead to a calamity greater than the slight harm that may come from the season.
And do not let it occur to you, my sons, as the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a certain disease will never allow its return, and that it is a permanent solution.
The matter is not as they assume, because cauterization is merely like a medicine that alters temperament and dries up the moistures that cause pain.
However, cauterization surpasses medicine due to its rapid success, powerful effect, and strong authority.
The illness may return at some time depending on the temperament of the patient, the strength and severity of the illness, the accumulation of excess in the body, and negligence in diet and other such causes.
Except if the illness treated with cauterization is a mild one and in an organ with little excess or moisture. Such as cauterizing a tooth to relieve pain or similar cases, where the pain may not return, though this is rare.
As for the saying of the common people that "cauterization is the last resort in medicine," this is correct but not in the way they think, for they believe that no treatment with medicine or anything else is effective after cauterization, which is not the case.
The meaning of “cauterization is the last resort in medicine” is that when we have used various treatments for an illness and these medicines have not succeeded, and then we employ cauterization as the last option and it succeeds, thus it is considered the last resort. Not in the sense understood by the common people and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than with iron, and they said this due to gold's balance and noble essence, and they said that the cauterized area does not fester; however, this is not universally true.
For I have tried it and found that this only applies to some bodies and not others, and cauterization with it is indeed better than with iron as they said, but when you heat a gold cautery tool in fire, it does not show you the desired degree of heat due to its red color.
And because it cools quickly, if you increase the heat, it melts in the fire and fuses, which causes inconvenience to the practitioner; therefore, cauterization with iron has become quicker and more reliable for practice, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections organized from head to foot so that the student may easily find what he seeks, God willing.
Chapter One.
In cauterizing the head with a single cauterization.
This cauterization benefits in cases of excessive moisture and coldness in the brain, which cause headaches, frequent nasal discharge from the head towards the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and throat pain. In general, it is suitable for any illness arising from coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The method for this cauterization is to first instruct the patient to evacuate with a purgative that cleanses the head for three or four nights, depending on the patient’s strength, age, and habit.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor, then seat him in front of you cross-legged, with his hands placed on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes, and where your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery tool, which appears as follows.
Expose an area of bone the size of a needlehead or a chickpea, then lift your hand, or if it has cooled, apply the tool again or use another tool. Until you see the amount of bone I mentioned to you, then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak a piece of cotton in it, place it on the spot, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a piece of cotton soaked in fat, leave it on until the crust from the burn disappears, then treat it with the quadruple ointment until it heals, God willing.
They have said that the wound, the longer it remains open and drains pus, the better and more beneficial.
Some have mentioned that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, holding the cautery tool until some thickness of the bone burns, then scraping off the burnt bone and treating it thereafter.
Others have said that one should cauterize deeply enough to affect the bone with a strong impact so that a piece of bone the size of a carat or a small button falls off, claiming this releases vapors from the head through that spot, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals. I do not see either of these types of cauterization used except in certain people and as a risky procedure. In my view, leaving it alone is better and safer, as the head becomes weakened when its natural connection is disrupted, as we have observed in other organs.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is, in my view, safer and better, and it is what I use, so practice it for safety, God willing.
Chapter Two.
On cauterizing the head as well.
If chronic pain occurs in the entire head and persists in the patient, and he has used electuaries, decoctions, snuffs, oils, and poultices, and especially if he has had the single cauterization we described but none of these provided relief, then consider the following. If the patient’s head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, then perform another cauterization slightly above the previous one. Then cauterize each temple of his head with a cauterization until the thickness of the skin is reduced and a portion of the bone, as we described, is revealed. Also cauterize the back of his head in the spot known as the “axe,” but apply lighter pressure here and do not expose the bone, for the patient experiences severe pain from this, unlike the pain from the other cauterizations of the head; I will mention this cauterization in its place.
The cautery tool used for the temples and the back of the head should be finer than the one used for the center of the head, and it appears as follows.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in one side of the head along with headache and the pain extends to the eye, then purge the patient with cleansing medications for the head and use the other treatments I mentioned in the disease sections. If these do not succeed, then there are two approaches to cauterization. Either cauterization with a caustic burning medicine or with iron.
For cauterization with a burning medicine, take a single clove of garlic, peel it, cut off its tips from both ends, then make an incision at the painful spot in the temple with a broad scalpel, creating an area under the skin to accommodate the clove.
Insert it under the skin until it is hidden, then secure it tightly with a bandage and leave it for about fifteen hours, then remove the bandage, take out the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days before applying a dressing.
Place a cotton ball soaked in fat on it until the area suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. Alternatively, you could do this with other burning medicines mentioned in the eighteenth treatise on caustic medicines.
As for cauterizing it with iron, it is done as follows: Heat the cautery tool, which appears as follows:
It is called the "nail cautery" because its head resembles a nail with some curvature and a small protrusion in the middle.
Then place it on the painful spot, hold your hand steady, and rotate the tool slightly; the amount of thickness you burn in the skin should be about half. Lift your hand to avoid burning the artery beneath, which would cause bleeding. Then soak a cotton piece in salt water, place it on the area, and leave it for three days. Then apply cotton soaked in fat, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you prefer, you can cauterize this non-chronic migraine with the blade-like tip of the cautery tool, taking care not to sever the artery in this specific case.
Chapter Four.
On cauterization of chronic migraine.
If you have treated migraine with the previously mentioned treatments and what we discussed in the divisions of diseases, but the treatment has not been effective, and you see that the ailment does not respond to the initial cauterization with medication or with fire. Then it is necessary to heat the blade cauterizer until it becomes white-hot, after marking the pain area with a line about half a finger’s length or so, and to press your hand firmly once so that you sever the artery and reach close to the bone.
However, you must be careful to avoid the moving jaw near the chewing muscles, so you do not burn the muscle or nerve that moves it, causing spasms.
Be vigilant and cautious of the arterial bleeding from the cut, as there is danger in severing it. Especially for one who is inexperienced or unskilled, it is better to avoid the procedure.
A discussion on managing arterial bleeding will come later in its respective section in the book, God willing, if you see that the ailment does not respond to this cauterization.
If the patient’s body can tolerate it, cauterize once in the center of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cauterization method described in the section on arterial ligature with the double-edged cauterizer, as it is more effective and preferable to this.
Chapter Five.
On cauterizing ear pains.
If ear pain occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other treatments mentioned in the division but the pain does not subside, then heat the cauterizer called “the dot,” as depicted here.
Then, after heating it, apply dot cauterizations around the entire ear or around both if the pain is in both. Keep the cauterization slightly away from the ear base after marking the area with ink, applying around ten dots per ear, or similar, then treat the areas until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
On cauterizing facial palsy.
The type of facial palsy treated with cauterization is the one caused by phlegm, as mentioned in the disease divisions.
Avoid cauterizing the type caused by dryness and nerve spasms.
When you have treated this type of facial palsy with medications, nasal applications, and gargles but the treatment is ineffective, the patient should be cauterized with three applications. One application at the ear base, the second slightly below the temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Apply the cauterization on the opposite side of the afflicted area, as the relaxation usually occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization method is to apply it at the upper edge of the ear, slightly under the temple, and another in the temple area, each about the length of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cauterization until you burn about half the thickness of the skin. This is the cauterizer, a blade type similar to the one previously shown, but slightly more delicate, as you see. The blade should be slightly thicker, and then treat the area as previously described until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On cauterizing chronic stroke.
If the stroke has become chronic and you have treated it as mentioned but it remains ineffective and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize with four applications. One application on each side of the head, one in the center of the head as described, and one at the back of the head as previously explained.
The cauterization description is as previously noted, and an application may also be applied to the pit of the stomach for greater effect, then treat as before.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterizing forgetfulness.
For forgetfulness caused by phlegm, the patient should first be given large pills and brain-purifying medications.
Then, shave his entire head and apply a mustard plaster to the back of the head as described in the section on plasters, repeating it multiple times as it serves as a type of cauterization.
Follow the same procedure precisely as mentioned, and if this is effective, there is no need for more; otherwise, cauterize with three applications on the back of the head, aligned from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
Leave the width of a finger between each cauterization, then treat the cauterized areas as previously discussed. If further treatment is required and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the central point.
If more treatment is needed, cauterize on both sides of the head, then treat until he recovers, using the olive-shaped cauterizer as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterizing paralysis and full body relaxation.
You should first purify the head with large pills as mentioned, then shave the patient’s head, cauterize once in the center of the head, once on each side, and once at the back of the head.
Apply three cauterizations on the vertebrae of the neck. If more cauterization is needed for body relaxation, and the patient is strong enough and the illness is severe, apply four cauterizations along the spine. Cauterize deeply until most of the skin is burned, then lift your hand and treat the area as previously discussed until healing occurs, God willing, using an olive-shaped cauterizer.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing epilepsy.
Cauterization is only applied to epileptic patients whose seizures are caused by phlegm; their brains should first be purified with large pills and other treatments mentioned in the classification if the patient is an adult and able to tolerate the medication.
If the patient is a child who cannot tolerate the medications, then apply purifying gargles and rinses for the brain several days in advance while improving their diet.
Then shave his head, apply one cauterization in the center of the head as previously described, and another at the back of the head. Apply one cauterization on each side of the head. If the patient is strong and able to withstand it, apply the same cauterizations described for cases of paralysis and body relaxation, on the neck and spinal vertebrae, using the olive-shaped cauterizer as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cauterizer more delicate in this way.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If melancholia is caused by corrupted fluids and thick phlegm, apply the cauterizations we mentioned for cases of paralysis.
If the melancholia is due to an excess leaning towards black bile and the patient’s body is moist, administer medication to purify the brain as previously detailed in the classification.
Then shave the patient’s head and make a secure ring of linen like a circle, place it in the center of the head while the patient sits cross-legged held in place from all sides, and then take one pound of aged sheep fat.
Heat the fat on fire to a moderate warmth, just enough that it is bearable to the finger if inserted, then pour it in the center of the head inside the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this once a week along with other good management until the patient recovers, God willing.
If you wish, cauterize with many small dotted applications without pressing the cauterizer down, just passing it close, as this type of cauterization moderately moistens the brain.
Then apply a cotton pad soaked in fat or chicken grease on it.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing for cataracts.
If you recognize the early signs of cataracts in the eye as described in the classification, promptly administer medication to purify the patient’s head, keep them away from all dampness, and make them sweat in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then instruct him to shave his head, apply one cauterization in the center of the head, and two on the temples if the cataracts are beginning in both eyes, or on one side if only in one eye.
Then, use the cauterizer to sever all veins and arteries beneath the skin, making the cauterizations elongated across the temples, and be careful to prevent bleeding.
If you observe any bleeding, staunch it immediately with any remedy you can; we will discuss techniques for removing and cutting arteries and preventing bleeding.
Additionally, apply two deep cauterizations on the nape below the bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic tearing.
If the eye tearing is chronic and persistent due to the veins and arteries on the outside of the head and you are certain this is from cold, thick, phlegmatic humors, apply the same cauterizations I described for early-stage cataracts. Apply one cauterization to the center of the head, two on the temples, and two on the nape under the bones. If further treatment is needed, cauterize each side of the eye's tail at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cauterizer.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing foul odor of the nose.
If you have treated it as described in the classification but the treatment is ineffective, promptly administer colocynth extract to the patient for three nights, shave his head, and apply a central cauterization with the olive-shaped cauterizer. Then apply two cauterizations above the eyebrows just beneath the hairline using the nail-shaped cauterizer, being careful not to sever the artery; this is the shape of the nail-shaped cauterizer.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing drooping of the eyelid.
If the eyelid droops due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once using the crescent-shaped cauterizer.
Alternatively, apply two cauterizations slightly above the eyebrows on each side, away from the temples, making each cauterization the length of the eyebrow.
Do not apply excessive pressure with the cauterizer; just enough to burn a third of the skin’s thickness. This is the shape of the cauterizer.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If the eyelashes turn inward, pricking the eye, there are two methods for cauterization. Either cauterize with fire or use a caustic substance; for fire cauterization, instruct the patient not to pluck his lashes if he does, allowing them to grow and align.
If the lashes prick the eye as they grow, secure his eyes with a bandage to prevent movement until they grow out. Once they have grown evenly, place the patient’s head in your lap, and mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Begin the mark close to the lashes, then place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or plantain saliva under the eyelid, and heat the cauterizer, which is shaped like this.
Cauterize along the marked shape little by little in several applications until the surface skin, in the shape of the myrtle leaf, is entirely burned. You’ll know the cauterization was successful when you see the eyelid retract and the lashes lift away from the eye tissue.
Then lift your hand at that moment and leave it for three days, then apply a cotton swab with ghee on it until the scab is removed, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing, and if some hair returns after some time and the eyelid relaxes.
Reapply the cauterization to that spot as you did initially, and if the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and the hair no longer pricks the eye. As for cauterization with the burning medicine, instruct the patient to leave the eyelashes alone until they grow and align.
Then make an image of an olive leaf from paper, then take some soap as prescribed and some unquenched lime, each weighing a dirham or so, and crush them both well, doing this quickly so it does not dry out. Then spread it onto the paper you prepared in the shape of the olive leaf and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes, and place a cotton soaked in egg white beneath the eye, with the patient’s head resting in your lap.
Place your index finger over the medicine and press it slightly, and you move it every time the patient feels the sting of the medicine, as they will feel a burning like fire; as long as they feel the sting, keep the medicine on and move it with your finger. When the sting stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Then observe: if you see that the eyelid has lifted as it does when retracting by fire or incision, otherwise reapply the medicine to the spot where it did not take effect or blacken until you complete your work and the eye retracts. Then apply cotton with ghee until the scab from the burn is removed.
Then treat it with palm ointment or other until it heals. During the procedure, you should take extreme care that none of the medicine falls into the eye; if the eyelid relaxes after several days and some hair pokes into the eye,
then reapply the medicine to the particular area of the eyelid that has relaxed, as you did initially, then treat it until it heals, and this is the shape of the olive leaf.
And know that people’s eyes vary in size, small or large, so adjust your retraction accordingly, and the correct approach is not hidden from anyone skilled in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterization of the fistula that occurs in the corner of the eye.
If you treat the fistula as we described in the divisions of diseases and your treatment does not succeed, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and a servant holds his head in front of you securely so that it does not move or shake.
Then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or psyllium saliva on his eyes, then heat the cautery instrument, which has this shape.
It should be hollow, like an eagle feather tube on the end used for cauterization, and if you wish, it may be perforated on the other end, or solid like a probe, but the hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open, expel the pus, and dry it. If it is not open, open it and extract its pus, then apply the cautery iron to it when it is very hot, holding it with your hand until you reach the bone.
Move your hand slightly away from the eye toward the nose when cauterizing to avoid misplacing your hand or disturbing the patient, which could cause the cautery to fall into the eye’s soft tissue and damage it. If you reach the bone on the first burn, otherwise reapply the cautery a second time if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton with ghee to it and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it has not healed, apply a sharp, caustic medicine to it until the bone is exposed, then scrape it as we will explain in its appropriate section, God willing.
Another method for cauterizing the fistula mentioned by some predecessors is to make an incision at the site of the fistula, then insert a thin funnel into the incision, which looks like this.
Pour about a dirham’s weight of molten lead into it, holding the funnel firmly and tightly, and the patient should not move at all to prevent the molten lead from spilling into his eye. It is advisable to place a cotton soaked in egg white or water over the patient’s eye.
The lead will burn the site of the fistula and heal it remarkably. If the fistula heals by the cauterization and treatment we mentioned, otherwise the nasal puncture technique must be used to redirect the fistula toward the nasal passage, as will be detailed in its specific section.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterization of the fissure of the lip.
A fissure often occurs in the lip called "the hair," especially in children’s lips, as it frequently occurs. If you treat this fissure with what we mentioned in the section but the treatment does not succeed, then heat a small knife-like cautery as depicted here.
Its interior should be as thin as a blade, then apply it quickly while it is hot directly to the fissure until the cauterization reaches the depth of the fissure, then treat it with wax until it heals, God willing.
The nineteenth chapter.
On cauterization of fistulas occurring in the mouth.
If there is swelling at the base of the gums, the palate, or the roots of the molars, followed by suppuration, rupture, and the formation of a fistula due to pus discharge, and if treatment fails, then you should heat a cautery of a size that fits within the fistula.
Then insert it hot into the fistula opening, holding your hand until the heated metal reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice, and then treat it with the prescribed remedies until it heals, God willing.
If the infection ceases and it heals, otherwise it is necessary to examine the area and remove the diseased bone as will be explained in its appropriate chapter, God willing.
The twentieth chapter.
On cauterization of loose molars and gums.
If the gums become loose due to moisture, causing the molars to shift, and if medicinal treatments have failed, then place the patient's head on your lap, heat the cautery as illustrated afterward, and place the tube on the molar.
Then insert the hot cautery quickly, holding your hand a moment until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth. Then remove your hand, and repeat the cautery as needed, then have the patient fill their mouth with saltwater.
Hold it for a moment and spit it out; the loose tooth will become firm, the relaxed gums will strengthen, and the harmful moisture will dry up.
The twenty-first chapter.
On cauterization for toothache.
If a toothache is due to cold or there are worms in it and medicine has not helped, there are two methods of cauterization: either with ghee or with fire.
For cauterization with ghee, take cow's ghee, boil it in an iron ladle or shell, then wrap cotton around the tip of a probe, dip it in the boiled ghee, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, holding it until it cools.
Repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. Alternatively, you may soak wool or cotton in cold ghee, place it on the aching tooth, and apply a heated piece of metal over it so that the heat reaches the tooth's root.
For cauterization with fire, use a copper or iron tube, thick enough to prevent the fire's heat from reaching the patient’s mouth. Then, heat the cautery (as illustrated), place it directly on the tooth, and hold it until it cools. Repeat this several times.
The pain will cease either that same day or the following day. After cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with fresh ghee, hold it briefly, and then spit it out. This is the illustration of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever side you wish, as appropriate. This is the illustration of the tube.
The twenty-second chapter.
On cauterization for lymphadenitis.
If the lymphadenitis is due to phlegm and cold humors and does not respond to medicinal ripening, and you want quick maturation, then heat the hollow cautery (illustrated) that has openings at both ends.
This allows the smoke to escape from the other end during cauterization. Place it, heated, directly on the swelling once or twice, if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the swelling. If the swelling is small, use a cautery of similar size.
Then leave it for three days, applying a cotton soaked in ghee to it until the burned area heals. Then treat it with ointments and wicks until it heals, God willing.
The twenty-third chapter.
On cauterization for hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If moisture dominates the trachea, especially with a cold temperament, the patient should first be purged with laxatives. Then apply a cautery at the hollow of the throat near the trachea’s root, in the depression.
Take care not to let the cautery reach the trachea and burn only halfway through the skin. Then apply another cautery at the neck joint on the last vertebra, thoroughly, using a pointed cautery as previously described.
Then treat it with the previously mentioned remedies until it heals, God willing.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
On cauterization for lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and if the patient has neither fever nor tuberculosis but has a chronic illness, apply two cauterizations above the clavicles in the soft, hollow areas, and another in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be pointed, as previously illustrated. If desired, perform the cauterization using the cautery called "the dot," previously illustrated for ear pain. This involves around thirty points or so.
Then treat it with the previously mentioned remedies until it heals. You may also create a three-pronged cautery, as illustrated, for a quicker cauterization, as it allows for three burns at once. This is the image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On Cauterizing the Armpit.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery fluids or does not stay in place when set, becoming prone to frequent dislocation even with the slightest movement, as we have observed, then first the joint must be set. Then the patient should lie on his back or on the healthy side, and you should raise the skin inside the armpit upward with the fingers of your left hand if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then heat the cautery iron with two prongs, as shown in this illustration.
Then cauterize the skin with it until you reach the other side, resulting in four cauterizations. It is also possible to use an iron with three prongs, in which case there will be six cauterizations, with the prongs lying on the delicate part of the site.
This is the image of the iron with three prongs.
An additional cauterization may be added to make eight, after which you apply crushed onion with salt to the cauterized area, and then instruct the patient to rest and avoid moving the limb for a while until it gains strength, if the dislocation was upward, though this is rare.
Cauterize above the shoulder with one good nail-shaped cauterization or with multiple dotted cauterizations so that the joint will firm up, the moisture will dissipate, and the patient will heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On Cauterizing the Stomach.
If coldness and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, altering its temperament, and nasal fluids accumulate therein, and if it is treated with various methods but to no effect, the patient should lie on his back, extend his legs and arms, and then you cauterize three times. One cauterization should be placed beneath the xiphoid process, the size of a finger, using a nail-shaped cautery, and two more below on either side of the first cauterization, forming a triangular shape. Space them apart to prevent them from merging if they suppurate, and make the cauterization depth about two-thirds of the skin's thickness, forming the cauterization pattern.
This pattern and this size should be used without excess.
And if you wish, you may apply one large cauterization in the center of the stomach, in this shape.
The cautery instrument used for this single cauterization should be circular, as shown in this illustration.
The stomach may also be cauterized in a dotted manner for those who cannot endure this cauterization. Mark the stomach with dots of the desired amount using ink, then cauterize it with a dotted cautery, and treat it as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On Cauterizing a Cold Liver.
If pain arises in the liver due to coldness and moisture or a trapped wind, and this disturbs its natural temperament excessively, and the patient is treated with the remedies mentioned earlier, but to no effect, then the patient should lie on his back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink on the liver, in this shape and size exactly, below the lower ribs, where the human elbow ends.
Place a finger's width between each cauterization, and apply the cauterization straight along the body length without firm pressure.
The amount burned should be about half the thickness of the skin, no more. The patient should stand on his feet, and if he cannot, then lie down with his legs extended and arms raised. This is the image of the cautery tool.
You can apply these cauterizations with a knife-shaped cautery if you have caution and skill in the craft. Take care not to go too deep in the cauterization, as this may burn the entire skin, the abdomen, and reach the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so be aware.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On Opening a Liver Tumor with Cauterization.
If an abscess forms in the liver and you want to determine if the tumor is in the liver tissue or in its membrane, if it is in the liver tissue, the patient will feel heaviness and a dull ache.
If it is in the liver membrane, the pain will be sharp, and if doctors find its treatment challenging, the patient should lie on his back, and the swollen area should be marked with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire, which resembles a probe, as shown in this image. Cauterize with it once, burning through all the skin and ending at the membrane, allowing all the pus to drain, and then treat it with abscess remedies until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be used by someone highly experienced in the art of medicine and who has encountered such conditions many times, for in my opinion, it is better to avoid it.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On Cauterizing Colic.
The ancients mentioned cauterizing with the roots of Aristolochia for cold colic in this manner: take one long dry root of Aristolochia, the longest you can find, about the thickness of a finger, immerse it in oil, and ignite it in the fire. Then cauterize once at the junction of the collarbone and neck, twice with small cauterizations just below the veins, slightly toward the area below the jaw, and twice with large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
Two more cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly angled toward the back, another cauterization in the middle of the chest, one above the stomach, and three on the back, one between the shoulders and two on either side of the spine, below the cauterization between the shoulder blades.
The cauterization should not be deep but should be superficial on the skin. Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery resembling a probe, which they would heat and insert between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
The pus is then drained, as we mentioned in liver tumors, but this opening with cauterization involves risk: either the patient may die immediately, or an unhealable fistula may develop in the area.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you treat spleen disease with the remedies mentioned in the section and your treatment does not succeed, then cauterization is to be done in three ways, all of which are correct. One way is to make three or four cauterizations arranged along the length of the spleen.
In the manner of liver cauterizations previously mentioned, with a space between each cauterization about the width of a finger or slightly more. The shape of the cauterizing iron should be the same as described for liver cauterization, and do not press deeply with the cautery. The patient should be lying on his back.
The other method is on the elbow, raising the skin opposite the spleen where the patient’s left elbow ends, and lifting the skin over the width of the body so that the cauterizations are applied along the length of the body.
Then, you insert two strongly heated cautery irons until they pass through the skin to the other side, then remove the cauterizing irons, so there are four cauterizations. If you wish, you may use another cautery iron with three prongs.
Then treat the cauterized area after leaving it to drain pus for many days, as this is more effective than all previous treatments.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterizing for dropsy.
Cauterization is beneficial specifically for sacculated dropsy. If you treat the dropsical patient with the various treatments mentioned in the section and your treatment does not succeed, then you should apply four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen, and two on his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin, then leave the cauterization open to drain pus for a long time.
Do not neglect to provide the patient with treatment after the cauterization as necessary, so that the two procedures together hasten his recovery. The shape of the cauterizing iron used on the back should be nail-shaped as previously described, and the one used on the back should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If, in the dropsical patient, the feet and legs swell and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the top of the foot, in the hollow between the little toe and the fourth toe.
Keep your hand steady with the cautery iron and do not twist it; then raise your hand and do not reapply it at all, as yellow water will drain out. The cautery iron should have this form.
Then cauterize each leg with two cauterizations each, using the knife-like end of the cautery iron. The cauterizations should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it toward the middle of the leg, and on each thigh, make two cauterizations.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so that water drains from it, and then treat it with the other remedies we mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On cauterizing for diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is caused by cold and moisture, which weakens the retaining and digestive powers of the stomach and intestines, and if it has been treated with various remedies without success, and if you see that the patient is strong enough to tolerate cauterization, then make a large cauterization on his stomach. As previously mentioned in stomach cauterization with a circular cautery iron, make four light cauterizations around the navel with a delicate nail-shaped cautery iron, and one cauterization on the lower back above the coccyx, either large or two small ones.
If you observe that the humors are abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize once on the pubic area and once on each side of the waist; sometimes you may add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, as this is a successful treatment whose benefit does not fail, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the cauterization of hemorrhoids.
If there are many chronic hemorrhoids or just one in the rectum, and they are caused by thick, cold humors or corrupt fluids, and if treated as we have described without success, then cauterize the patient three times on the lower vertebrae of the back just below the sacrum in a triangular form.
And once cauterize below the navel about two fingers' width, and if you assess that the stomach has cooled and his food does not digest and you see his face swollen, cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization as previously mentioned, and once on the liver. Another on his spleen with a pointed cautery iron and leave the cauterization open for a time, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the cauterization of warts.
After cutting them, if you cut the wart, heat the cautery iron shaped like a stylus, then insert it, heated, into the wart itself after it has been cut, and press firmly until the iron reaches the vein from which the blood flows; do this once or twice.
If there are many warts, cauterize each one as we have described, then treat them with suitable ointments until they heal, and if you cauterize with a large cauterization on cotton, it will be more effective in benefit.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On the cauterization of the fistula that occurs in the rectum and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and operation that we described in its place and hesitates, he may be cured with cauterization. When a fistula appears in someone and persists, with pus and corrupt fluids flowing from it, the first thing you should do is measure it with a fine probe.
Then assess its depth with the probe, heat the cautery iron shaped like a stylus, then insert it, heated, directly into the fistula according to the depth of the fistula and the extent to which the probe entered, and repeat the cauterization until all of the corrupt matter is burned, once, twice, or thrice as needed.
Be cautious not to burn a nerve if present, or a major vein, and if the fistula reaches the mass of the bladder or the mass of the intestines.
Take care with all of these locations, and you should only perform this if the fistula is in a fleshy location and you believe it is not penetrative. Then treat the area until it heals, and if the area closes and the discharge stops, remaining so for a time, know that it is fully healed.
And if the discharge does not stop, know that it is penetrative or that there is decayed bone in its depth or something similar, which will be mentioned in its proper place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On the cauterization of the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind and affects the patient’s intercourse, then you should cauterize the sides directly over the kidneys, one cauterization over each kidney with the pointed cautery iron mentioned previously, and sometimes we cauterize a third time over the sacrum, resulting in three aligned cauterizations, which will be more effective in benefit.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
If weakness and laxity occur in the bladder due to cold and humors, causing the patient to be unable to retain urine, then cauterize below the navel over the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, once on the right of the navel and once on the left.
After the cauterization, from each side the width should be about a thumb joint, and cauterize once on the lower back or twice if needed, using the pointed cautery iron as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On the cauterization of the uterus.
If there is a condition in the uterus from cold and humors, preventing conception, causing menstrual irregularities or obstructed flow, or causing pain upon its arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder. Once on the sacrum at the lower back or twice, using the pointed cautery iron.
Chapter Forty.
On the cauterization of hip dislocation.
Sometimes phlegmatic humors accumulate in the hip joint, causing it to dislocate, indicated by one leg appearing longer than the other when measured, and a void at the site of dislocation. Therefore, the patient should be cauterized at the hip joint itself in a semi-circular shape.
After marking the area with ink around the joint so that the joint itself lies in the center of the circle, use the cautery iron previously described for the stomach cauterization. If that cautery iron is not available, cauterize three times with the large olive-shaped cautery iron.
Make the cauterization depth match the thickness of the entire skin, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
The forty-first chapter.
On cauterizing the sciatic nerve.
If pain occurs in the hip area due to cold and moisture, and you have treated the patient as described in the classification and the treatment was not effective and the condition persists, the patient should purge thick humors with colocynth or aloeswood pills or similar.
Then, cauterize it, and cauterization can be of two types: either cauterizing with caustic substances or with fire, and cauterization with fire has many forms, one of which is to cauterize directly on the hip itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
Make them deep enough, with the distance between each cauterization about the width of a finger, and the cautery iron should be olive-shaped. One may also make a cauterization in the middle on the hip itself, totaling four cauterizations. If you wish, cauterize it with the circular iron previously mentioned in the dislocation of the hip, as a single cauterization.
The circle should encompass the entire hip and burn the entire thickness of the skin. This is the description of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize the thigh with two cauterizations on the area where the patient indicates pain, and one cauterization above the ankle, four fingers toward the outer side. The cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should only reach the thickness of the skin.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends toward the toes, cauterize where they indicate with the point cautery three or four times, or more if needed. If they indicate pain below the knee toward the leg, cauterize there with a single knife-shaped cauterization.
Be cautious in all your cauterizations not to extend the cauterization to the point where you burn a nerve or major artery, as this could cause serious harm or disability to the patient.
I have seen cases where cauterization above the ankle was overdone, causing swelling in the leg that extended to the foot, leading to ulceration and the entire leg deteriorating, followed by diarrhea and eventual death. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize them in exactly this manner.
Some scholars among the wise have described a method of hip cauterization using a cup-like iron instrument, with a diameter of half a span and a rim thickness the size of a date pit or slightly less, with a second and third cup inside.
The distance between each cup should be the width of a thumb joint, with the cups open on both sides, and the height of the cups is about one or two joints. It has an iron handle firmly attached to the cups, and this is its form.
Then, it is heated in the fire until it becomes red and sparks, then it is placed on the hip with the patient lying on the healthy side. You make three circular cauterizations at once, then leave it for three days, dress it with fat, and leave the wound open for several days.
Afterwards, treat it with ointments until it heals. The author of this book states that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its unsightliness and terrifying appearance, and because few can endure it, though it is an effective cauterization for those who can tolerate it and when applied to the right location.
As for cauterization with caustic substances, it involves making two cup-shaped devices resembling door hinges from copper or iron.
Their edges should have a height of about two joints, with the space between them the width of a finger, open at the top and bottom, and joined together in this form.
Then, place it on the hip with the patient lying on the healthy side, and secure your hand tightly. Pour between the two rings the strong water, slightly warmed, and hold it for about an hourglass measure. The patient endures its sting and burning, which feels like fire.
When the stinging subsides, remove the device and wipe the caustic water from the entire hip with fresh water. Then, leave it for three days and apply fat until the blackness of the burn disappears, allowing pus to drain for a few days, as it is highly beneficial.
Then, treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold to hold the water in place as you did with the hip. This is the description of strong water, as recorded in the article on medicine refinement.
Take equal parts of soda ash and unslaked lime, crush them, and place them in a new pot with a small hole at the bottom just large enough for a rod. Place a glazed pot underneath.
Add fresh water to the soda ash and lime to cover them by a finger's depth, pressing them down firmly with your hand. Let the pot sit until the strong water drips into the glazed pot below, then collect all this water and pour it onto fresh lime and soda ash again.
At this stage, it becomes very potent, effective in various medical applications and in cauterizing other parts, as it acts just like fire. Other substances used to cauterize the hip include thapsia, baladhur honey, and lime mixed with soap.
Galen mentioned a treatment from an ancient man for hip pain and sciatica, highly praising it and claiming that no other treatment is needed and that it cures with a single application.
Until he might be carried into the bath and emerge cured, which is achieved by taking green mustard; if the fresh green is not available, then use the recently dried one, finely ground with some fat, and apply it to the hip where the pain is, or on the leg or thigh.
Tie it and leave it for about three hours or until the patient feels the burning sensation has subsided, then take him to the bath; when his body becomes moist, place him in the pool, and the pain will depart, and he will recover by God's permission. If he does not recover, repeat the dressing ten days later.
He will recover, God willing. Be aware that cauterization with these treatments should not be used without first cleansing the body. Dioscorides mentioned that goat dung, if used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial for it.
The cauterization is done in this manner: take wool soaked in aged oil and place it on the deep area between the thumb of the hand and the wrist, closer to the wrist. Then take a piece of dry goat dung.
Ignite it with fire until it becomes a glowing ember, then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then take another piece, and keep doing this until the sensation reaches from the middle of the upper arm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called dung cauterization.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On the cauterization of back pain.
Back pain may occur from many causes, such as a fall, blow, excessive evacuation, and so forth, and it is often due to the accumulation of cold, moist matter. Cauterization is performed in this type alone.
When the cause is the accumulation of cold matter, after purging the patient with potent pills and similar treatments, cauterize the back at the site of the pain in three rows across the width of the back itself. Mark the area with ink, and in each row apply five cauterizations or more, according to the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cauterization is done with a dot-shaped cauterizer. If you wish, you may perform three or four cauterizations with a medium nail-shaped cauterizer in this way.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On cauterization for the onset of humpback.
This condition frequently affects young children. Its early sign in a child is that he experiences shortness of breath upon standing and moving, and at the end of his vertebrae, you will find a protruding knob that stands out from the other vertebrae.
If you observe this and wish to halt it, cauterize it with a circular cauterizer in this manner. Ensure the cauterization covers each side of the vertebra evenly. If you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a dot cauterizer in two or three rows, keeping the dots close together. Then treat the area until it heals as we have described.
Take care to use cauterization only on a hump caused by nerve contraction.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterization of gout and joint pains.
If joint pain arises from cold moisture flowing to any part of the body, when pain occurs in the legs, physicians specifically call this gout.
If cold-caused gout is treated with the various treatments we described in detail and the pain persists, cauterization will relieve it. Perform it after purging around the joints of the legs with multiple cauterizations using a medium olive-shaped cauterizer in this manner.
If you need to dot the front of the leg, do so with a dot cauterizer. If the pain extends to the knees or other joints, which often occurs, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side using this same olive-shaped cauterizer.
If more cauterization is needed, cauterize without pressing too deeply; keep it at skin level only. If the pain extends to the hips or back, apply the cauterization we described in its appropriate section.
If the pain is solely in the hands, dot around the wrists in two encircling rows. If the pain remains in the fingers, dot each joint and along the back of the hand. If, after a few days, the pain ascends to the elbows or shoulders.
Cauterize each of them from all sides. The patient should not lack good management and medication, for if he eats well and purges the phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On cauterization of hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and part of the intestine and omentum descend into the testicle and the case is recent, instruct the patient to refrain from eating for a day and to use laxatives to clear his bowels.
Then have him lie on his back before you, instruct him to hold his breath until the omentum or intestine protrudes, then push it back with your finger. Mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a sign resembling a semicircle with its ends pointing towards the upper body.
Then heat a cauterizer shaped like this.
Until it becomes white-hot, emitting sparks, then return the intestine or omentum into the body, while an assistant places his hand on the area to prevent the intestine from protruding. Spread the patient’s legs and place a cushion beneath him, while another assistant binds his legs.
Another assistant holds his hands over his chest, then apply the cauterizer directly on the mark, holding it upright and steady, pressing until it reaches the bone, or repeat if the first application does not reach the bone.
Take great care to prevent the intestines from protruding during cauterization, lest they get burned, which could cause either death or great calamity for the patient. And know that if your cauterization does not reach the bone, your work will not succeed; the cautery for children should be gentle, appropriate to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized site after three days with ghee until the scab from the burn subsides, then treat it with other ointments until it heals. The patient should lie on their back for forty days until the wound seals.
His diet during the treatment should be such that it softens the bowels, preventing the intestines from protruding during straining or defecation. When he wishes to stand after the forty days, apply a firm bandage and keep it for another forty days. He should avoid exertion, overeating, drinking excessively, and loud shouting.
If he follows this regimen, he will be completely healed, God willing. I will discuss the treatment of hernias through incisions in its chapter, God willing. As for a hernia that occurs in any part of the abdomen and is in its early stages, if you wish to prevent its growth, cauterize it with a circular burn proportional to its size. Let the area of the skin you burn be approximately two-thirds of the hernia's size, then treat it as we have described, for it will not increase, God willing. Some early practitioners recommended cauterizing the hernia with a triangular-shaped cautery in this form.
After marking the hernia with ink, make a transverse line on the upper side of the hernia and another line below, then apply a single nail-shaped burn in the center. The first method of cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On the cauterization of sprains.
If a fall or blow causes pain in a certain limb and the pain persists for a long time without responding to medicinal treatment, cauterize it with a pointed cautery. The cauterization should correspond to the size, weakness, or strength of the affected limb.
If the pain and sprain have firmly affected the limb, it may heal with the first cauterization. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization, as such pains tend to move from one limb to nearby areas, so cauterize them until the patient recovers.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
As for lepers, they greatly benefit from cauterization, especially in cases of leprosy caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
When you wish to cauterize it, observe whether the leprosy is in its early stages and has been treated as mentioned in the division but has neither subsided nor stopped. If you fear that the corruption will overtake the patient's entire temperament, cauterize the head with five burns. One burn in the center of the head, the second below it near the forehead at the hairline, two on the temples, and one at the back of the nape. Press your hand firmly with the cautery to slightly affect the bone.
This will cause scales to peel, allowing the thick vapors to escape. Also cauterize the spleen as previously mentioned. If the leprosy has advanced significantly in the patient and appears visibly, apply the cauterizations we mentioned on the head. Apply one burn to the tip of the nose, two to the cheeks, two on the neck vertebrae, six on the back vertebrae, one large burn on the coccyx at the end of the spine, another above it on the sacrum, and two on the hips, one on each hip. Apply two burns on the knees, one on each knee, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the chest bones, and cauterize each joint of the fingers and toes with one burn, as well as each ankle and wrist.
Be careful with the nerve at the back of the ankles to avoid burning it. A burn may also be applied to the pubic bone, another to the pit of the stomach, and another to the liver. Know that the more you increase the cauterizations, the more beneficial and effective they will be.
Understand that the patient does not feel the pain of cauterization as a healthy person would because his body has become numb. The cauteries should vary in size according to the size of the organs and joints, as previously outlined regarding the cautery tools.
Then treat the cauterization with chickpea flour mixed with honey and other remedies until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On the cauterization of numbness: when any organ becomes numb and has been treated with medications, oils, and compresses without healing, cauterize the numb organ itself with burns according to the size of the organ. Let your cauterization penetrate the thickness of the skin slightly.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals. In cases of numbness that affect the hand or foot, cauterize at the vertebrae of the spine where the nerve controlling that organ emerges, and the numbness will dissipate.
Only someone well-versed in the anatomy of organs and the pathways of the body’s motor nerves should undertake this procedure.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On the cauterization of vitiligo.
If vitiligo becomes chronic and no medical remedy proves effective, cauterize the affected area with a burn that is slightly deep, according to the skin’s thickness, until the whiteness fades and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour mixed with rose oil, plantain leaves, pigeon’s blood, or the blood of swallows, taking one part of each. Mix all together, apply to a cloth, and secure it to the site until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On cauterization of cancer.
If cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, cauterize around it with a circular iron as it revolves; some sages have advised a deep cauterization in its center, but I do not agree because I anticipate it may ulcerate, which I have observed several times.
The correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle as we said, or with numerous cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On cauterization of abscesses.
If an abscess forms on someone and it is slow to mature, either due to the humor causing it, the patient's advanced age if he is elderly and has little blood, or the season, and you wish to hasten the abscess’s maturation, cauterize around it with numerous small pin-like cauterizations.
Then leave it, for it will hasten to mature; if you wish to lance it with cauterization, heat the iron in this shape.
Apply it to the center of the abscess until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be directed downward so that the pus flows easily, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On cauterization of malignant ulcers.
The malignant ulcer is essentially decay spreading through the tissue, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood; if you see the ulcer in a place suitable for cauterization with fire, heat many nail-shaped cautery irons, both small and large, according to what suits the area of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from every side until all decay is eradicated and nothing remains; then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas so that all scabs and decay are removed.
Then treat it with ointments that promote tissue growth; if after three days you see that healthy tissue is growing without decay, otherwise reapply the cauterization to any remaining diseased areas; the malignant ulcer may also be treated with a strong medicine.
For it serves the same purpose as fire but acts more swiftly; I have detailed its treatment with strong medicine in the division, so you may refer to it there whenever needed.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted warts.
This condition often occurs on the soles of the feet and is a rough matter that causes pain; it may be treated by two methods of cauterization, either with fire or with strong water.
As for cauterization with fire, heat the hollow cautery iron resembling an eagle’s feather made of iron, sized to surround the wart from all sides with thin edges, then apply it hot to the wart and rotate it around the wart with your hand until the cautery iron reaches the wart’s depth.
Leave it for three days until pus gathers, then bandage it with wild mallow pounded with salt, leaving the dressing on overnight, which will cause the wart to detach from its roots; then treat the wound with an ointment that promotes tissue growth until it heals, if the warts are not inverted.
Warts often appear on the body’s surface, especially on the hands and feet; you should take a tube made of copper, iron, or an eagle’s feather, place it over the wart or verruca, and pour a small amount of strong water into the tube.
Hold the tube while rotating it and apply slight pressure with your hand so that the tube’s edge affects the wart’s root, allowing the strong water to penetrate deeply to the wart’s root; the patient should bear the sting of the strong water for a short while.
Then leave it, and the wart will be removed by its roots; proceed this way, treating each wart individually until all on the body are addressed, and then treat the sites after removal with ointments that promote tissue growth.
Chapter Fifty-Four.
On cauterization of tremors.
If a tremor arises in someone due to cold in the nerves or from quartan fever or otherwise, you should cauterize him four or five times along the vertebrae of the spine, with a cauterization between each vertebra, and one on his chest. And one cauterization on his stomach with an olive-shaped cautery iron, as this will calm the tremor and hasten the maturity of the cold illness.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On cauterization of boils on the body.
Ugly boils may erupt on the body due to cold, thick, and corrupt humors, so at their first appearance, cauterize the top of each boil lightly with a myrtle stick whose tip has been ignited, with long aristolochia, or with a lentil-shaped cautery iron.
Boils can be cauterized in this manner at their onset to prevent them from worsening and to disperse the causing humor so that the patient heals, though it should be done after the patient is bled.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On cauterization of hemorrhage occurring from artery severance.
Hemorrhage often occurs from a severed artery due to an external wound, the incision of a tumor, or cauterization of an organ, making it difficult to stop.
If this occurs, quickly place your index finger on the artery’s opening and press firmly to trap the blood beneath your finger and prevent any flow; then place several small and large olive-shaped cautery irons in the fire until they become very hot.
Then take one of these irons, either small or large, depending on the wound and the site where the artery has burst, and apply the cautery iron directly to the artery after quickly lifting your finger, holding the cautery iron until the bleeding stops.
If, when you lift your finger from the mouth of the artery and the cautery goes out, the blood surges, then quickly take another cautery from the prepared ones in the fire, and continue doing this one after the other until the blood stops.
And be careful not to burn a nerve that might be there, which would cause the patient further harm. Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if the artery is large, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization as we mentioned, or by severing it if it has not already been severed. For when it is severed, its ends contract and the bleeding stops, or it may be tied tightly with threads, or medicines may be applied to it to stop the blood, with firm bandaging.
As for those who attempt to stop it with a ligature or tight bandaging with cloths, or by applying burning objects and the like, the bleeding will not stop completely except rarely. If someone encounters this and there is no doctor or medicine available, they should quickly place the index finger directly on the mouth of the wound as we described.
Press it very firmly until the blood is restricted, and pour very cold water continuously over the wound and on the artery, while keeping the finger in place, until the blood thickens, clots, and stops. Meanwhile, assess whether cauterization or medicine is needed.
Chapter Two.
On incision, puncturing, venesection, wounds, and similar procedures.
Khalaf said: We mentioned in the first chapter every illness for which cauterization with fire and burning medicine is suitable, along with its causes, explanations, tools, and forms of cauterization, and I organized this from head to foot.
In this chapter, I will follow the same approach, so that the student may easily find what they seek.
Before I begin, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more danger than the first chapter on cauterization.
For this reason, caution should be greater here, as in this chapter, the work often involves releasing blood, which is essential for life, when opening a vein, incising a tumor, lancing an abscess, treating a wound, extracting an arrow, or incising for a stone—all of which involve risk and fear, and most often result in death.
I advise you to avoid falling into situations of doubt, as in this profession, you will encounter different types of people with various illnesses. Some of them have become so weary of their illness that they no longer fear death.
Due to the severity and length of their suffering, their condition may clearly indicate death, and some will offer you their wealth, enriching you, in hopes of health, even though their illness is fatal. You should never assist those who come to you in such a condition.
Let your caution exceed your desire and eagerness, and do not undertake any procedure until you have certain knowledge of its positive outcome. In treating your patients, always use prior knowledge and inform them of the outcomes leading to safety.
For this will help you earn praise, glory, reputation, and commendation. May God, my sons, inspire you with guidance and never deprive you of correctness and success, for it is in His hands; there is no god but Him.
I have organized this chapter into sections, as in the chapter on cauterization, from head to foot, so that what you seek may be easier for you, God willing.
First Chapter.
On treating the fluid that accumulates in the heads of children.
This condition often occurs in children at birth when the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness, and it may also occur due to an unknown hidden cause.
I have not seen this condition in anyone other than children, and all those I saw afflicted by it soon died, so I decided to leave this condition untreated. I once saw a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day. Until the child could not sit up on their own due to the size of the head, and the fluid continued to increase until they perished.
This fluid may either collect between the skin and the bone or beneath the bone on the membrane. If the fluid is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, one should make a single horizontal incision in the center of the head, about two finger-breadths in length, to allow the fluid to flow. This is the image of the scalpel.
If the fluid is greater and the swelling is larger, make two intersecting incisions in this manner:
If the fluid is beneath the bone, indicated by the sutures of the head being open on all sides and the water moving inward when pressed by hand—this is not difficult to recognize—then make three incisions in the center of the head in this manner:
After the incisions, drain all the fluid, then secure the incisions with cloths and bandages. Moisten from above with a drink and oil until the fifth day, then release the bandage, and treat the wound with twisted cloths and ointments. Do not cease to bind the head moderately, and feed the patient with dry, low-moisture food.
Until the area strengthens and heals. Another method for incision is to observe where the swelling and fluid accumulation appear most, as it may be more prominent at the back, front, right, or left of the head.
Direct the incision to where the swelling and water accumulation are visible, and incise as you are able. Take care not to sever an artery, causing bleeding that could lead to the patient’s death along with the fluid drainage.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears known as the pulsating ones.
When a person suffers from sharp illnesses affecting the eyes or chest, and the condition persists with no relief from medicinal treatments, the best treatment is to cut these two arteries.
If you intend to cut them, shave the patient’s head with a razor, then rub the area with a coarse cloth to reveal the artery. Tighten the patient’s neck with part of his garment, and locate where the pulse beats; these spots are the depressions behind the ears, rarely concealed except in some people.
Then, mark them with ink, and cut them with the scalpel, down to the bone, and horizontally across the head. If desired, insert the scalpel beneath the artery and lift it upward with the cut, making the length about two joined fingers.
When the artery is severed, the blood spurts out rhythmically in a forward leap. If the artery is not visible by touch, measure three fingers’ width from the ear, mark with ink, and cut down to the bone.
Release an average of six ounces of blood, although sometimes more or less may be released, depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of his arteries. Then examine the wound, and if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it away.
To prevent any hot swelling, dress the wound with a strip of linen cloth and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On extracting the arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic migraine, sharp catarrhs from acrid fluids, heat in the temple muscles, severe chronic headaches, or similar ailments, and has been unsuccessfully treated with various medical therapies, we have tested in such cases the extraction or cauterization of the arteries from the temples as described.
The method for extracting them is to shave the hair on the patient’s temples, then locate the visible artery in the temple, which is identified by its pulse and is rarely hidden except in a few individuals.
Or in extreme cold, if it is not visible, have the patient tighten his neck with part of his garment, then rub the area with a cloth or compress it with hot water until the artery is clearly visible. Then, take the scalpel, which looks like this. Gently peel away the skin with it until you reach the artery, then hook it and pull it up until it emerges from the skin, freeing it from the membranes beneath on all sides. If the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook. Then, cut a portion sufficient for its ends to separate and contract, preventing bleeding. If it is not completely severed, blood will not stop flowing. Drain between six and three ounces of blood.
If the artery is large, tie it in two places with a strong double thread, which should either be silk or lute strings, to prevent rapid infection before the wound heals, as this could lead to bleeding.
Then cut the excess between the two ligatures, doing this immediately or later if desired. Alternatively, cauterize it to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are cut off, which achieves the same effect, if not better, as mentioned.
Unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, as cautery helps deplete moisture and thus enhances the benefit. After extracting the two arteries, pack the area with old cotton, apply firm compresses, and, after removal, treat with dry medications that stimulate tissue growth and with twisting, until healing is complete, God willing.
If bleeding occurs from the artery during the procedure, quickly stop it, either by cautery or by filling the area with alum and applying pressure until the blood stops. If nothing is available, press your finger on it until the blood clots.
Then, wash the area with very cold water to calm the intensity and secure it properly. A lighter and easier alternative to artery extraction is to cauterize the vessel with a double-bladed cautery, marking the two points with ink.
Heat it very intensely, and apply it down to the bone so that the artery is severed in two places and its ends are separated, as they will not heal together after this cautery. Here is the shape of the cautery.
It has two sharp blades, resembling small awls, but is significantly less sharp than a knife; if they were as sharp as knives, they would cool quickly and would not sever the flesh quickly. With some thickness, they retain the heat of the fire.
And it cuts the flesh quickly. This procedure is better, lighter, and easier than all others, and the distance between the blades should be the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
On the treatment of constant hot tears flowing to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and flow from the veins on the outer skull, and if they do not benefit from any medicinal treatment, and you see the patient's face reddened. And he feels in his forehead a creeping sensation like that of ants; his eyes are emaciated and moist, their lashes eroded and lids sticky from the sharpness of the tears. Therefore, the ancients resorted to this procedure in its treatment, which they called "treatment by the sword," where you instruct the patient to shave the hair on his forehead.
Then, make three parallel incisions along the length of the forehead, each incision about two fingers' width, with one incision aligning with the length of the nose at the center of the forehead, the second slightly distanced from the movement of the temple muscle, and the third on the opposite side.
Be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from the connection of the jaws. Each incision should be about three joined fingers apart. Have prepared sponges or many dry cloths ready to wipe the blood.
Then, insert the sharp two-edged scalpel, which has this shape. From the incision near the temple to the middle incision, strip off all the skin between the two incisions along with the membrane over the bone. Then repeat this from the middle incision to the third incision, after which you remove this scalpel. Then, insert another instrument into the first incision, called a small knife, sharp on one side and smooth and blunt on the other. This is its shape:
Place its sharp side upward towards the flesh attached to the skin, with the smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, cutting all the vessels that flow from the head to the eyes without the cut reaching the outer skin.
Then do the same from the middle incision to the other incision, and after a moderate amount of blood flows, press the sites to remove the clotted blood. Then insert in each incision a wick of wet cotton and place a dressing soaked in wine and oil or vinegar and oil on it.
To prevent hot swelling, on the third day, remove the bandage and apply ample washing with lukewarm water, then treat it with Basilicon ointment with rose oil and other treatments for wounds until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from within the head.
When someone experiences frequent, sharp, persistent discharges, and you see that his eyes are emaciated and small, his vision weakened, his eyelids ulcerated, and his eyelashes falling off. And he has a sharp, painful ache deep in his head and frequent sneezing; know from these symptoms that these materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment for this is to instruct the patient to shave his forehead and make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.
And he has a sharp, painful ache deep in his head and frequent sneezing; know from these symptoms that these materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment for this is to instruct the patient to shave his forehead and make a single incision in the middle of the forehead. Or slightly raise it transversely, beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple, cutting down to the bone, keeping your hand away from the muscles of the temples that move during chewing, until the bone is exposed and all blood is wiped away with a sponge.
Separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or linen twists, then secure from above with dressings soaked in wine and oil to prevent hot swelling. When you remove them and see that the hot swelling has subsided, it is necessary to scrape the bone so that flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that encourages flesh growth, such as using two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony to prepare an ointment, which is used to grow flesh in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
On the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is of one of four types: either a mineral stone or something stone-like, such as iron or glass; a plant seed, like a chickpea or pit, or similar; a liquid, like water, vinegar, or the like.
Or an animal; if a pebble or pebble-like object that does not expand falls into the ear, face the ear towards the sun, and if you see the pebble, drop in a little violet oil or sesame oil, then try to remove it by shaking the head or sneezing with colocynth powder. Block the nostrils when the sneeze arrives, after placing a ring of cloth or wool around the ear and pulling the ear upward; often, this removes the object. If it does not come out, try to remove it with fine forceps shaped like this.
If it comes out with the forceps, or if not, attempt removal with a fine, slightly bent blunt hook. If it still does not come out, make a copper tube and insert one end of the tube firmly into the ear hole.
Seal around the tube with pitch softened with oil so that no air escapes except through the tube, then draw in air forcefully, which often removes it. If it does not come out with what we have described, take a bit of Nabataean gum or the prepared gum used to catch birds and place it on the tip of a rod.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, gently insert it into the ear hole after drying the ear from moisture. If it does not come out with all that we have described, proceed to incision before hot swelling or spasms occur.
The method of incision is to first bloodlet the patient from the cephalic vein, extracting blood according to his strength. Then you seat the patient before you, turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near the lobe in the lower part.
The incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever tools you can, quickly stitch up the incision immediately, and treat it until it heals.
If the fallen object in the ear is one of the grains that swells and expands, try removing it with the aforementioned method. If it does not come out, then take a fine, delicate scalpel in this manner.
Attempt to cut that type of grain that fell into the ear, but only do this if you are certain that the grain has softened from the ear's vapor until it breaks into many small pieces, which you then remove with a blunt hook or a delicate forceps or by suction.
As we have mentioned, it will be easy to extract it. As for water that enters the ear, the patient should first use spikenard to sneeze, having filled his ear with some old cotton while lying on the ear containing the water to see if it exits this way.
If not, take many small, smooth pebbles the length of fingers, warm them slightly over the fire, and the patient inserts one into his ear hole. He then hops on his leg on that side and strikes another stone against the one in the ear.
Continue doing this with pebble after pebble until all the water comes out. Alternatively, water can be removed by taking a reed or feather, inserting one end into the ear, and then burning the other end until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.
Repeat this process until all the water is out, or draw it out with a tube as previously described with the pebble. As for removing an animal that has entered the ear, if it is small-bodied like a flea or similar, treat it as mentioned in the division.
If its body is large enough to be felt, try to remove it with forceps and hooks, as it is easier than anything lodged in the ear. For removing worms that may develop in the ear, if you have treated it as mentioned in the section on drops and it has not worked.
You should look at the ear in sunlight; if you see any worms, remove them with fine forceps or hooks. If none appear, take a tube shaped like this.
The tube should be narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. Insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suction it strongly. Repeat this several times until all the worms come out. If they do not come out, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned for the pebble.
If they do not come out as described, use the drops I mentioned, which were used by the ancients to kill worms. You will find this in the section on drops, and pour oils and medicines into the ear using this instrument, which is shaped like this.
As you see, it is made of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. If you wish, the plunger inside the tube can be made of solid copper. Alternatively, you can take a probe, wrap its end tightly with cotton.
Then pour the oil or juice or whichever medicine you want into the tube while it is in the ear, then insert the cotton-tipped probe from above, squeezing it moderately until the oil is pushed into the ear canal, where the patient will feel it.
The patient will feel it inside. Ensure that what you pour into the ear has been warmed slightly over a fire, and avoid pouring anything extremely cold or hot into the ear, as it cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
On treating blockages in the ear.
Some children are born from their mothers’ wombs with their ear passages unperforated.
Some people may also experience a blockage in the ear canal due to an injury or flesh growing there. This blockage may be deep in the ear hole and not visible.
It may also appear slightly outside the hole and be visible. The one deep in the ear and invisible is usually harder to heal, while the visible one should be treated by positioning the patient’s ear in sunlight. Look into the ear; if you see the blockage, open it with a delicate scalpel shaped like this.
Its tip should be slightly wide, with a partial edge, and the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear. If the blockage is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, hold it with a fine hook and cut it gently until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep in the ear, take a fine, smooth probe, warm it slightly over a fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage, along with the hearing heaviness the patient feels, carefully open it up.
Be careful not to wound the ear nerve, then place a wick in the ear, sized to the width of the hole, soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure the wound will not heal. Alternatively, take a wick, moisten it with water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.
Use it, and if you see the ear swelling with a hot inflammation, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick that has been soaked in cerate made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides, then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use any of the treatments that stop bleeding, as mentioned in the section on cauterization.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids can be moist or dry, so you should hold them with tweezers or a hook and cut them off from their roots with a scalpel, then apply powdered vitriol to the area.
If they bleed, cauterize them gently with a lentil-shaped cautery; cauterizing them after cutting is preferable, as they often return if any of the roots remain. If burned with fire, these roots are destroyed and do not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of the cyst that appears on the eyelids.
Something often appears on the eyelids resembling hail in its firmness and hardness.
For this reason, it is called "hail," as it is the gathering of thick moisture in the upper or lower eyelid. The procedure for it is to examine; if the cyst is protruding on the outer eyelid and moves in all directions, it is easy to manage by making a horizontal incision on it.
Then peel it gently from all sides until it is detached, then hold it with a hook and cut it off. If you are unable to cut it off without piercing the eyelid, this will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, close it with sutures and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, there is no issue, as the ointment will support and heal it. If the cyst is inclined towards the inner eyelid near the inner surface, invert the eyelid, hold the cyst with a hook without needing an incision, and cut it off from all sides.
If you pierce the eyelid during the cutting, it will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the cyst with salt water and treat the area with healing agents until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of the lipoma that appears on the eyelid.
The lipoma is a fatty growth in the layers of the upper eyelid. It is more common in children and weighs down their eyes, causing them to experience nighttime discharges and preventing them from looking at sunlight. Because tears come to them quickly.
For this reason, you see them constantly leaning forward on their faces and sleeping in this position, with their eyelids under the brows moist and swollen, the lipoma visible. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the lipoma between them. The procedure is to have the patient rest their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth to prepare a wick, making a circle out of it that surrounds the lipoma from all sides, then place it on the lipoma, pressing with your fingers from all directions to gather the lipoma in the center of the circle.
Then make a horizontal incision in the middle of that moist area with the scalpel, ensuring the incision is no larger than that for bloodletting. In terms of depth, cut through the entire skin until you reach the lipoma.
In most cases, the lipoma will emerge from the incision as a white, fatty piece, which you pull out with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, rotating your hand right and left until it is fully extracted. Be cautious not to enlarge the incision to avoid letting the scalpel slip toward the eye and causing harm.
If the lipoma does not appear with the initial incision, you should gently extend the incision slightly until the lipoma emerges, then pull it out as described. Then soak a cloth in vinegar and water, place it on the area, and secure it with a dressing; some people crush salt.
They place the salt inside the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture, then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing poultices until it recovers.
Chapter Eleven.
On various methods for lifting the eyelid.
If abnormal eyelashes grow on the eyelid in an unnatural direction below the normal lashes and become chronic, they harm the eye and cause various conditions like constant tearing, drooping eyelids, whitening, and thickening, eventually leading to blindness.
Eyelid lifting is done in four ways: by cauterizing with fire, by sharp medication as previously discussed in the cauterization section, by cutting and stitching, or by a reed technique, as I will describe.
You should place the patient’s head in your lap, then invert the eyelid with your left hand. If it doesn’t invert, insert a needle with a thread from below the eyelid, and pass the needle with the thread above, near the lashes themselves, pulling the thread upwards with the eyelid.
Invert it with a probe, then make an incision in the inner eyelid just below the excess lashes with a scalpel, from the outer canthus to the inner canthus. Then remove the thread and place a small cotton or cloth pad under the eyelid, marking it with ink.
Like the shape of a myrtle leaf, but the shape should be to the extent needed for raising the eyelid, as it varies among people; some may need a suitable amount cut from the eyelid depending on the degree of its sagging.
And some may need a smaller cut, all in proportion to the eyelid's sagging; then you make an incision along the two marked lines, starting from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, and the single incision should be near the natural eyelashes, as thick as the eyeliner rod.
Then insert the hook into one corner of the skin, peeling it all away, then stitch the lips together with a needle and a thin wool thread, wipe the blood, and attach any excess threads to the brows with some adhesive if.
You wish to do so; otherwise, it does not matter. Then keep the stitches and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. If you prefer, leave the wound without stitching and treat it with something drying and constricting, as the eyelid will rise when the wound heals, though stitching is preferable.
This method of retraction was mentioned by the ancients, though it is laborious for the patient, and it is a good method without risk. Another method for retraction is to mark the eyelid in a shape resembling a myrtle leaf, as we described. Then lift the eyelid with three hooks, either separated or grouped, in this way:.
Then cut the excess of the eyelid with small scissors, in this way, making a balanced cut:.
If you cannot secure the hooks and they do not remain in place, take a needle with thread and insert it into the center of the shape, then insert another thread near the larger canthus and a third thread near the smaller canthus; hold the threads evenly between your fingers, then lift your hand with them in a balanced manner.
Lift the entire marked skin as we described, then bring the edges of the wound together with stitches and treat it until it heals; if a hot swelling appears at the cut or incision, soothe that swelling with cerate or similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also turn its lashes inward, in which case you should apply what we mentioned regarding cutting, stitching, retraction with fire, or using a caustic agent; retraction with fire or the caustic agent is more effective and easier on the patient than cutting and stitching, though cutting and stitching are more skillful.
Retraction with reeds is done in this way: invert the eyelid and make an incision on the inside as described, then create two thin reed or wooden rods, each as long as the eyelid, and their width slightly less than the width of the scalpel.
Make small notches at their ends on both sides for the threads to hold, then gently gather them on the excess eyelid skin and firmly tighten the reeds on both sides and leave it for a few days, as the tightened skin will die, blacken, decay.
Until it falls off by itself; if it is slow to do so, trim it with scissors, then treat it until it heals. When it has fused, the eyelid will rise, and the lashes will no longer irritate the eye. This is the image of the two rods; make them to this shape and with these exact dimensions in length and width:.
Chapter Twelve.
On removing irritating hair from the eye with a needle.
If there is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a fine needle and insert a thin, smooth silk thread, then bring its ends together and tie them in a very delicate knot, and the length of the thread should be about a span.
Then insert another thin, shorter thread in the loop and tie its ends if you wish; then the patient rests his head in your lap, near sunlight to make the work clearer, as it is a delicate procedure. Then, insert the needle with the loop at the root of the excess hair.
Pass it through the eyelid quickly so it emerges above the natural lashes, then pull the thread upwards through the loop and insert into the loop the hair if there is one, two, or three, no more.
Then pull your hand to remove the hair with the loop through the eyelid along with the natural lashes. If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, pull the loop downwards with the thread you inserted until the loop exits from the upper hole.
Then reinsert the hair into it and pull them; repeat this until it rises to the upper hole and you can see it with your eye. At this point, withdraw the loop and thread, close the eye, and keep it closed for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place and flesh grows around it.
If the hair is short, you may either add a long natural hair to it so it rises with it, or leave it until it lengthens after a time, at which point you can raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the treatment of entropion (inversion) that occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
This entropion is referred to as "hare’s eyelid" and may occur either naturally or accidentally; accidental cases arise from the healing of a wound, a cut, or cauterization, and similar causes.
The method of treatment is to cut through the scar tissue, separate the edges, insert a piece of linen between them, and bind it until it heals; drying and constricting substances should not be used in its treatment.
If you do this, the entropion will return worse than before; instead, use softening agents such as fenugreek and apply poultices soaked in water in which marshmallow and flaxseed have been boiled, or apply a softening ointment of diachylon melted with a small amount of oil, applying it to the linen and treating with it.
The key to its treatment is to try by every means to prevent it from healing in its original form; this procedure we have described is merely to correct the entropion, not to restore the area completely to its previous condition.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of entropion that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This entropion of the lower eyelid is, in truth, called entropion; it may be natural or accidental, with accidental cases arising from a wound, cut, or cauterization, and the like.
The procedure involves taking a needle threaded with doubled thread, inserting it through the flesh from the left inner corner of the eye to the right, so that the thread lies at the edges of the flesh; then, pull the flesh upward with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to the desired shape, stop; if not, take a probe, place it on the incision, invert the eyelid with it, and make two cuts on the inner side of the eyelid; the edges of the cuts should meet at the angles of the original incision, forming an angle. Until, when joined, they form a shape similar to this:.
Which resembles the Greek letter lambda. Then remove a section of flesh so that the sharp edge is below the eyelid edge, then bring together the separated parts with two stitches, using woolen thread, and treat with the softening agents and linen as described until it heals.
If the entropion arose from a cut, stitch, or cauterization, make a simple incision below the eyelash line as previously described, then separate the edges with linen, as we have described.
In summary, when treating entropion in either the upper or lower eyelid, perform the procedure according to the appearance of the entropion, as its form may vary greatly; an experienced surgeon will devise a solution by whatever means possible.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or something close to it; the condition itself will often guide you on the appropriate procedure and instruments.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or the cornea.
This adhesion occurs in many people, whereby the upper eyelid becomes attached to the white of the eye, impeding its smooth movement and hindering its natural functions; it is necessary to insert the tip of a probe beneath the eyelid.
Lift it upwards or extend it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel that is not as sharp as typical scalpels but rather slightly dulled, so as not to distress the patient during the procedure, causing the scalpel to slip and injure the eye with its sharpness; make the cut as if you are peeling away the adhesion.
Be cautious until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is fully healed; then pour saline water into the eye to wash it, or instill a solution of verdigris dissolved in water, then separate the eyelid and the eye with a linen wick.
Place a woolen pad soaked in egg white over the eye; after the third day, apply healing ointments until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the excision of pterygium and excrescences of flesh in the eye corners.
The pterygium is of two types: one is fibrous, resembling a thin, hard membrane; the other is non-fibrous, resembling a moist, white, solid material that disintegrates when touched by metal or if caught by a hook.
The hook does not hold on to it. Both types originate from the larger corner of the eye and spread gradually until they cover the pupil, blocking light and eye movement. The procedure to excise it involves placing the patient's head on your lap.
The patient then opens their eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand; grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and pull it upwards, then take a needle threaded with a hair from a horse or cow, or a strong thread, bend the needle’s tip slightly, and insert it into the center of the pterygium.
Pull it through with the needle, tying the thread to the pterygium, and extend it upwards; with the hair, peel away the side of the pterygium facing the pupil, as though you were cutting it with the hair, to the end; then excise the remaining portion at its origin with a fine scalpel or small scissors, preserving the natural tissue at the inner corner.
This is to prevent the persistent flow of tears that may result from cutting it. You may extend the pterygium with only the hook or the thread as we described, then peel it with a smooth scalpel at the point resembling this shape:.
Take care that the scalpel does not touch the corneal membrane and cause a rupture, leading to a bulge in the eye; then, after the incision, place a little powdered salt or verdigris ointment in the eye, and leave it until the next day before treating it as necessary until it heals.
If the pterygium is non-vascular and you are unable to insert a needle or secure a hook in it, this type of pterygium is often treated with medication until it heals, as described in the classification; if you want to remove it, open the patient’s eye.
Take a smooth, delicate scalpel with a weak edge, as shown here: And gently scrape the pterygium from above with it; if you see it loosening and fragmenting, and the scraping affects it, immediately apply a drop of verdigris ointment, red ointment, or powdered salt in the eye, and bandage it until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all removed, unless a hot swelling develops in the eye, in which case leave it alone and treat the swelling until it heals; then resume scraping it until it heals. As for the protrusion of flesh in the inner corner of the eye:
If the protrusion severely irritates the eye, hook that protrusion with a scalpel and remove some of it without cutting too deeply to avoid excessive tearing, then apply red or verdigris ointment to the eye corners until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the excision of “warding” (fleshy growths) and the excess flesh that grows in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red flesh may grow densely until it covers or nearly covers the pupil, spilling onto the eyelids and possibly causing the eyelids to turn outward, resembling the blossoms of pomegranate flowers.
The procedure is to have the patient place his head in your lap, open his eyes, and extract all the red flesh with appropriate hooks.
Or, hold it with tweezers or forceps and cut the flesh piece by piece until it is completely removed, taking care not to harm the eye during the procedure; you may cut it either with the scalpel described for pterygium excision or with small scissors. Similar to those used to remove vessels, as shown in the next chapter.
When you have finished excising and all the “warding” is gone, fill the eye with crushed salt or apply red powder and other caustic medications, placing a cotton pad with egg whites over the eye to prevent hot swelling.
If any “warding” remains and excessive bleeding or swelling concerns you, leave the eye alone and treat it with anti-inflammatory remedies, then resume the procedure until it heals. Treat any excess flesh appearing in the eye similarly.
However, you should avoid treating any inherently weak eye or one with a temporary condition using surgical tools, and you should not begin any of these procedures unless the part is able to tolerate it.
Chapter Eighteen.
On removing the blood vessels from the eye.
The vessels are red veins that spread over the eye, obstructing vision and weakening the eye over time. You should first examine whether the eye with these vessels is strong and does not have any disease other than the vessels.
Then, perform the procedure by instructing the patient to place his head in your lap, and use one or two hooks to grasp these veins according to your skill, with the hooks delicately bent as shown here:
Or use double hooks in a single frame, as shown here:
Then carefully cut those veins with fine scissors, wiping away the blood from time to time until you see that the veins have disappeared and the blood has drained. Take care not to harm the eye with the scissor tips, and perform the work midday in sunlight.
Be steady in your work so as not to cut anything other than these veins. When you finish, apply green or red ointment to the eye to eliminate any remaining vessels. If you cannot remove it all at once, bandage the eye to ease its pain.
Leave it for several days until the pain subsides and there is no risk of hot swelling; then, repeat the procedure in the same manner until it heals. This is an image of the scissors used for this.
Leave it [and have the patient’s head rest in the assistant’s lap, while another assistant wipes away tears and adjusts the view of the front and back of the eye]. The basic approach is to open the eye with fixed or triangular openers held by an adept assistant.
The assistant should be skilled, with the patient’s head resting in his lap while another dries the tears and adjusts the view in the front and back of the eye. You can start removing from the upper or lower part of the eye, preferably by placing two hooks on the upper side, one at the end and the other at the beginning of the corneal ring.
Hold them between the middle and index fingers, then attach hooks opposite them from below, holding them between the ring and little fingers, and raise your hand gently until you see the entire vessel elevated; cut from the smaller end as you wish, with either scissors or a fine scalpel.
Thread the probe onto a needle and remove the entire vessel until it is lifted from the membrane. Do not stop drying, as the tears and blood will accumulate on you.
Then cut with scissors any excess above and below the ring so that nothing remains attached except on the cornea. If you can lift it off the cornea by peeling with the probe, it is better, and it may be possible in some people.
Once cut, it may cause irritation for several days, easing pain and preventing hot swelling; then repeat the procedure.
Chapter Nineteen.
On restoring the feather to the nose.
Doctors call the feather a fistula; if you treat it with cautery or a strong burning medication as previously described and it does not heal, then the only option is to cut open the swelling once it ripens and extract all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed; if you see decay or darkness in the bone, scrape it with an instrument that looks like this:.
It is called the rough-headed tool, made from Indian iron with a rounded head like a button, engraved with fine grooves like a file or a rasp. Place it on the damaged part of the bone and rotate it between your fingers, while applying a bit of pressure, until you see that the decay has been removed.
Repeat this several times, then treat the area with drying and astringent medications. If the area heals, new flesh grows, the discharge ceases, forty days pass without new issues, there is no swelling, and nothing else occurs.
Then know that it has healed. Otherwise, the only option left is to guide the fistula to the nasal cavity as follows: expose the bone again with iron or strong medication. When the bone is exposed, take a probe shaped like this:.
The iron should have a triangular tip and a tapered rod that narrows towards the end as you see. Place it directly on the bone, near the canthus, and keep your hand slightly away from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it.
So that he feels air exiting if he holds his hand to his nose. At this point, treat the area with drying, astringent medications as I described earlier. When the flesh grows back and the area hardens, the material that used to drain outside will return to the nose, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On restoring a bulging eye.
If the entire eye bulges without causing harm or impairment in vision, the patient should first be given a purgative. Then perform phlebotomy on the cephalic vein and place a cupping glass on the nape without incision, applying gentle suction.
Then apply a poultice made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and tragacanth to the eye, and bandage the eye over the dressing with numerous pads. The pads are prepared by taking several soft cloths, folding each piece into four layers to make many of them.
Then, stack them one on top of the other as needed for the eye, and bind them tightly with a firm cloth. Reapply the cupping glass with suction without incision, then remove the cup and keep the eye tightly bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during this time, it should be tightened well. Remove the bandage after a day and night as said, and if you see the eye has returned, if not, repeat the dressing, pads, binding, and cupping until it does return.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On removing the berry-like protrusion.
If a hernia appears in the choroid layer, then bulges and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a berry, distorting the person's appearance, and you wish to remove it, proceed as I will describe.
Insert a needle at the base of the berry from bottom to top, then insert another needle threaded with a doubled thread near the canthus, and pass it through, leaving the first needle in place.
Then cut at the point where the thread is doubled, tie it around part of the berry around the needle, and tighten it well. Remove the needle and apply wool soaked in egg white to the eye, leaving it until the threads fall with the berry. Then treat the eye with strengthening medications.
Until the wound heals, you may also encircle the berry from all sides with a strip of cloth to further increase the bulge of the eye. Then incise with a fine scalpel deep enough to drain the white fluid, allowing the eye to subside and wither. Bind it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On treating "Kamna" (a specific eye disease).
This ailment called Kamna is a fluid that accumulates in the eye, resembling cataracts but is not that. The procedure for this is to seat the patient upright on a chair, then hold his head with both hands.
Shake it until you see the fluid descend to the bottom of the eye; at that point, the light should reappear, and the patient should see as he previously did. If it does not descend, we then know it is water (cataract). If the fluid does not descend as described,
Seat the patient before you and take a fine scalpel, making a small incision above the corneal membrane at the point where it connects with the conjunctiva, so that the fluid may drain out.
When it drains, drop warm water mixed with honey or water boiled with fenugreek and honey into the eye, then treat with other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have mentioned the types of fluid in the division and which is suitable for needling with an explained and clarified discourse, so take it from there with accuracy, and then you should seat the patient before you, cross-legged, facing the light close to the sun.
You bind the healthy eye and tie it well, then lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye with fluid is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the needle close to the ciliary margin, with the thickness of a probe, into the very whiteness of the eye from the side of the smaller canthus, then push the needle firmly while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye, feeling that the needle has reached something hollow.
The needle should reach to a depth proportional to the distance from the pupil to the end of the black (the ciliary margin), as the copper is visible to the observer due to the transparency of the corneal membrane, then move the needle upward to the spot where the fluid is located.
Then press it downward repeatedly; if the fluid descends immediately, the patient will see whatever his vision has opened to immediately while the needle is in his eye, and then settle slightly. If the fluid ascends, lower it a second time without withdrawing the needle.
When it settles and does not ascend, gently withdraw the needle, twisting it gradually with your hand. Then dissolve a bit of pure Andarani salt in water and wash the eye from the inside, then place over the entire outside of the eye a strip or wool moistened.
With rose oil and egg white, binding it along with the healthy eye. As for us and the people of our time, we place on it ground cumin with egg white. If the needle does not respond to entering the eye due to its hardness, as some people have very hard eyes. Then you should take the lancet called the "post," which has this shape:.
Use it to pierce only the conjunctiva, not deeply, but merely to make a delicate passage for the needle, then insert the needle as we have described. Upon completing your work, prepare the patient to lie down securely on his back in a dark room.
He must refrain from all movements and coughing, and you provide food that softens his temperament, not allowing his head to turn right or left at all. The binding remains as it is until the third day, then you untie it in that dark room and test his vision.
Show him objects, then reapply the binding until the seventh day. This should not be done at the time of treatment or immediately after needling, but rather you should avoid it, as the fluid may rise quickly from intense gazing.
If a hot swelling appears, the eye should be unbound before the seventh day, and treat it with what will relieve the swelling until it subsides, then allow his vision to be released and place a veil over his face to train his sight from underneath it for days, while he is in that dark room.
He gradually leaves the room and resumes his activities. Know that in needling, the learner cannot do without repeated observation before proceeding with the work. I have heard from some Iraqis that it is said in Iraq they make a hollow needle to absorb the fluid.
I have not seen anyone in our country make that nor have I read it in any book of the ancients; it may indeed be a recent invention. Here is an illustration of types of needles for those who are unfamiliar with them:.
They are made especially of copper, with their tip exactly this thinness, triangular and sharp-tipped.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On Treating the Fleshy Growth in the Nose.
Different types of excess flesh may grow in the nose, some resembling many-legged scorpions, some being cancerous hardened flesh of a dull color, and some being soft flesh without a dull color.
If any of this flesh is soft, neither malignant nor cancerous, you should seat the patient before you facing the sun, open his nostril, insert a hook into that flesh, pull it outward, and cut off what you can of it with a delicate sharp blade from one side.
Until you ascertain that all the flesh has gone; if anything remains that you could not cut, scrape it away with one of the delicate instruments gently so that nothing remains. If blood overcomes you or a hot swelling appears.
Then counter it with what is necessary, or if it is of malignant swellings, proceed to cauterize it so that the blood ceases and all flesh is gone, then instill vinegar and water or wine in the nose after cutting. If the nose opens and moisture passes through to the throat.
Then know he is healed; if moisture does not pass through as it should, know that inside it there is flesh growing at the top of the loose bones that the instrument did not reach in cutting, and then you should take a somewhat thick linen thread.
Tie many knots in it, making the distance between each knot about the width of a finger or less, and the patient maneuvers to insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or whatever he can after shaping it like a button, drawing in its scent until it reaches the choana.
It emerges from his throat, and often boys at school perform such an act; it is something easy for whoever wants it. Then, you gather the two ends of the thread: the one that exits at the mouth and the other that remains in the nose.
Then you use the knots in the thread to separate the flesh. You do this until you are sure the flesh has been severed by the knots in the thread. Then you remove the thread and insert into the nose, after wiping away the blood, a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment, repeating this for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh, then finally insert a lead tube into the nose for a few days until it heals. If a drying treatment is needed, use it.
Here is the image of the nasal dropper used to drip oils and medicines into the nose.
It is made of silver or copper, resembling a small open-topped oil lamp, and its channel is likewise open.
Or if you wish, you may make the tube closed like a reed, with the oil reservoir of the dropper flattened.
It has a handle at the end, as you see, to hold when heating the oil or any desired extracts or flowing substances within it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On Warts Growing at the Tip of the Nose.
Often, a wart grows at the tip of the nose, enlarging and increasing over days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it at its initial appearance and completely remove it, then apply to the site either cauterization or a caustic drug that acts as cauterization. If its removal is delayed until it grows large, then examine it; if it is hardened, firm, dark-colored, and with little sensation.
Then do not treat it with a blade, for it is a cancerous tumor. Often I have seen those who removed this tumor suffer severe consequences. However, if the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you think it can be fully removed. Then drain the patient's humors, remove it without caution or hesitation, and treat the site with drying and astringent agents until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On Suturing the Nose, Lip, and Ear. When the connection is severed by a wound or similar cause, know that when a separation occurs in one of these cartilages, surgical intervention seldom succeeds except in certain cases.
When such an issue arises, observe whether the wound is fresh and bleeding, so that you can bring the edges together with suturing and treat it until it heals. If the separation of the connection has left each side intact, then you should scrape each side to the thickness of its visible skin until it bleeds.
Then bring the lips together with suturing, tighten them, sprinkle over them finely powdered calcite and frankincense, and place over the powder a plaster made of palm ointment or other binding ointments. Leave it bound for two or three days, then release it.
Then replace the medicine and leave it until the sutures naturally dissolve. Then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to close the separation either with needles as described in abdominal suturing or with thread as I taught you there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On Removing Nodules That Appear in the Lips.
Many people may develop small hard nodules inside their lips, some resembling lupine seeds, some smaller or larger. You should invert the lip, incise each nodule, and grasp it with a hook.
Cut it from every side, then pack the site after excision with powdered vitriol to stop the bleeding, then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the sites with an astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On Removing Excess Flesh in the Gums.
Excess flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called "epulis." You should hook it with a needle or hold it with forceps and cut it at its base, letting the fluid or blood flow. Then, apply powdered vitriol to the site.
Or use one of the astringent drying powders. If the flesh regrows after treatment— as it often does— cut it again and cauterize it, as it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On Scraping the Teeth with Iron.
Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the inner and outer surfaces of the teeth and between the gums, turning black, yellow, or green, which can lead to gum damage and disfigure the teeth.
You should seat the patient before you, with their head in your lap, and scrape the molar or tooth that shows scales or sand-like deposits until nothing remains of them. Do the same with any black, green, or yellow deposits and others until the teeth are clean.
If the deposits are removed with the first scraping, otherwise repeat the scraping on another day, and a second and third day if necessary, until you achieve the desired result. Know that each tooth may require scrapers of different designs and shapes as suited to your work.
This is because the scraper for the inside of the tooth differs from the one for the outside, and the one for between the molars has yet another form. Here are several types of scrapers to have prepared:
Chapter Thirty.
On Extracting Teeth.
You should treat the toothache with every means and delay extraction, for once extracted, it cannot be replaced, as it is a precious element. Only when extraction becomes inevitable,
should the patient resolve on extraction, you must confirm that the affected tooth is indeed the painful one. Often the patient is mistaken about the pain's origin, thinking it is in the sound tooth, leading to its extraction, and the pain does not cease until the diseased tooth is removed. We have seen barbers make this mistake many times.
When you have identified the aching tooth, you should incise around it with a moderately strong scalpel to loosen the gum from all sides. Then, move it gently with your fingers or fine forceps at first, bit by bit, until it loosens.
Then, use the large forceps firmly, holding the patient’s head between your knees to stabilize it, and pull the tooth in a straight line to avoid breaking it. If it doesn’t come out, use one of the other instruments, inserting it beneath the tooth from all sides gently, moving it as before.
If the tooth is decayed or eroded, fill the cavity with cloth and plug it well with a thin stick so it does not fragment while grasping it with the forceps. You should make a thorough incision around the gum from all sides.
Take great care not to break it, leaving part behind, causing the patient a worse affliction than the original pain. Avoid the ignorant practice of barbers who hastily extract teeth without using the techniques we described.
They often cause great harm to people, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving all or part of the roots behind. Or even tearing away part of the jawbone, as we have seen many times. After extraction, rinse with wine or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs, as it often does, then crush some vitriol and pack it into the site.
If the vitriol does not help, cauterize it. The fine forceps used to move the tooth at first should have long tips, short handles, and be thick so they don’t bend when gripping the tooth. Here is the shape of the large forceps:
They should be, as you see, with thick handles so that when you grip, they do not give way or bend, with short tips. They should be made of Indian iron or well-forged steel, with serrated tips that interlock for a firm and secure grip.
The tips can also be made in the form of a file, making them strong in their hold.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the extraction of molar roots and removal of broken jawbones.
If a root remains after a tooth extraction and breaks, you should place a piece of cotton soaked in ghee on the spot for a day or two until the area softens, then insert the forceps or hooks. These resemble the beak of the bird called the balarja, and this is the image of the hooks.
They are made like a file from the inside or like a scalfage; if this tool does not suffice to extract it, you should excavate around the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert the instrument resembling a small lever, which has this shape.
It has a short, somewhat thick end and is not tempered to prevent breakage; if the root is removed with this, otherwise use these other tools with this form, the first having a triangular end with some thickness.
Another fine triangular image.
We may also use this tool with two prongs, which has this image as well.
And with other instruments and metals previously mentioned in the extraction of molars, we may also use this tool resembling a large hook, which has this image.
It has a triangular, slightly curved end with some thickness to prevent breakage, and it is untempered; know that there are many tools for molars, as well as countless other instruments, and the skilled craftsman in his craft may invent his own tools based on what the work and ailments themselves indicate.
For some ailments, no instruments were mentioned by the predecessors due to the variety in their types; if a bone of the jaw or a part of the mouth breaks or becomes infected, examine it in its place with one of these appropriate tools and hooks that were mentioned for root extraction.
We may use forceps with this image.
It should have a slight thickness to hold the bone so it does not slip until the bone is removed, then treat the area with appropriate medicines; if the bone has a small infection, clean it from the decay and blackness until it is clear, then treat it until healed.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On filing teeth that grow over others.
If teeth grow outside their natural course, they mar the appearance, especially when it happens in women and slaves; observe if the tooth grows behind another tooth.
If it cannot be filed or sanded, remove it; if it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this tool, which has this image.
It resembles a small beak and should be made of Indian iron, with a very sharp tip, and cut over many days due to the hardness of the tooth so as not to disturb the other teeth; if it is well-positioned to be filed, file it with an Indian file, which has this shape.
It should be entirely Indian-made, with a delicately engraved handle, resembling the file used to make needles; gently file the tooth little by little over many days so it doesn’t loosen and fall, then finally smooth and refine it with some files.
If part of a tooth breaks and irritates the tongue while speaking, it should also be filed until the roughness of the break is removed, so it becomes smooth and doesn’t harm the tongue or distort speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite down on food for fear of them falling, and you have treated them with astringent medicines without success.
The remedy is to bind them with a gold or silver thread, with gold being preferable as silver rusts and decays after days, while gold remains as it is forever; the thread should be moderately thin and thick according to what fits between the teeth.
To bind, take the thread and insert its bend between the healthy teeth, then weave the thread ends between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until the weave reaches the healthy tooth on the other side.
Then weave back to the side where you started, and tighten your hand gently and carefully so that the teeth do not move at all; tie the thread at the roots of the teeth to prevent slipping, then cut the extra thread ends with scissors, twist them with the forceps, and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose one.
This prevents it from hurting the tongue, then leave it bound as long as it lasts; if it loosens or breaks, tie it again with another thread, and it will remain like this forever. This is the image of the teeth and the weaving structure for two healthy and two loose teeth as you see.
One or two teeth may also be reinserted in their place after falling, bound as described, and they will remain; this should be done by a skilled, expert craftsman. Bone from cattle may be carved into the shape of a tooth and placed in the spot where a tooth was lost. Thus, bind it as we have said, and it will remain secure, allowing the patient to benefit from it.
Chapter Thirty-Four
On severing the frenulum under the tongue when it impedes speech.
The frenulum under the tongue may either be a natural condition present at birth, or it could be a result of a healed wound.
To treat it, open the patient's mouth with their head resting on your lap, lift the tongue, and then sever the frenulum horizontally until the tongue is freed from its restriction. If it has some firmness or complication due to a healed wound, insert a hook, and make a horizontal incision until the frenulum is severed and the knot is undone.
Be careful not to make the incision too deep, which may cut an artery and cause bleeding; after the cut, let the patient rinse with rose water or a mix of vinegar and cold water. Place a piece of cotton under the tongue, for the patient to hold there each night.
This prevents it from rejoining; if bleeding occurs, apply powdered alum. If bleeding persists, cauterize the area with a suitable lenticular cautery tool. Then treat it with other appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Five
On removing the frog-like growth beneath the tongue.
A growth resembling a small frog may form under the tongue, preventing the tongue from functioning normally, and it may grow large enough to fill the mouth. To treat it, open the patient’s mouth toward the sunlight and observe the growth.
If it appears dark or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation, do not intervene, as it is a carcinoma. But if it is pale and moist, insert a hook and incise it gently with a fine scalpel, then free it completely from all sides.
If bleeding overwhelms you during the procedure, apply powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then resume until the growth is fully removed. Afterward, have the patient rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other suitable remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six
On treating tonsil inflammation.
In the throat, glands similar to those externally located may appear, called the tonsils. If you have treated them with the recommended remedies and they have not healed,
Observe carefully; if the growth is hard, dark in color, and has little sensation, do not treat it with metal. If it is red and thick at the base, also avoid metal due to the risk of bleeding, but leave it to ripen until it can either be opened or burst on its own.
If it is white, rounded, and thin at the base, it should be removed. Before doing so, examine whether the inflammation has completely subsided or reduced somewhat.
Then, seat the patient facing the sun, with their head resting in your lap, open their mouth, and have an assistant hold down the tongue with a tool that looks like this.
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When the tongue is pressed down, revealing the growth in full view, take a hook, insert it into the tonsil, and gently pull it outward as far as possible without pulling along any membranes.
Then, cut it with a tool resembling scissors, except that its ends curve with very sharp edges. It is made of Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this tool is unavailable, use a scalpel that resembles this shape:
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner, then after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.
If he has a hemorrhage, gargle with water that has boiled pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves or the like of astringents until the bleeding is stopped, then treat him until he is cured. And other swellings may grow in the throat other than the tonsils, you cut them as I mentioned in cutting the tonsils, alike.
And I treated a woman from a swelling that had grown inside her throat, tending towards paleness, with little sensation, almost blocking the throat, and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had prevented her from eating and drinking water.
She was on the verge of death had she stayed like that for a day or two, and two branches of the swelling had risen up to protrude from her nostrils. So I acted quickly, inserted a hook into one of them, then pulled it out, and a considerable piece came away.
Then I cut it off where I reached it through the nostril, then did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. I then opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue, inserted the hook into the swelling itself, and cut off some of it, and only a little blood flowed.
The woman’s throat was freed, and she immediately rushed to drink water and then to take food. We continued to cut away at the swelling multiple times over a long period, and the swelling would regenerate in place of what was cut, so that it was a prolonged effort for both her and me.
I devised a solution and cauterized the swelling inside her throat thoroughly, and it stopped increasing. Then I traveled away from the area and did not know what God decreed for her after my departure.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On the Excision of Uvula Swelling.
This is known as a “grape” if an affliction descends to the uvula, causing swelling, and it is white and elongated; this is called a “column.” If it is thick at the base and rounded, it is called a “grape.” If treated as we mentioned in the chapter and the treatment does not succeed.
And you observe the hot swelling has subsided and it is thin, so it should be excised; however, if it is gathered into a round mass without length and is bloody, dark, black, or numb, it should be avoided for excision.
As it poses a risk to the patient, if you observe it with the qualities I described—whiteness and length—you should seat the patient facing the sun, press the tongue with the instrument we previously described, then insert the hook into the “grape.”
You should pull it downward and excise it with one of the two tools I mentioned for tonsil removal, ensuring that you cut only what exceeds the natural size, nothing more, as cutting more may harm the voice and speech.
After excision, apply the method we described for tonsil removal and treat it until it heals. If the patient fears the excision, you should use the technique of cauterization without worry or hesitation, done with a sharp medicine, positioning the patient’s head in your lap.
Then press his tongue with the mentioned tool, take some of the sharp water we described in the cauterization chapter, mix it with unslaked lime, making it neither too thick nor too thin, and fill it in the hollow of this instrument. Its shape is as follows:.
Its end, where the medicine is placed, is hollowed like the bowl of an applicator spoon. Position the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself while the patient lies on his side, allowing saliva to flow out of his mouth from the throat to prevent anything from entering the throat and causing harm.
Hold the medicine in your hand, pressing it on the uvula for about half an hour until you see it blacken and the sting of the medicine subside. If you wish, take cotton, wrap it around the tip of an applicator, and dip the cotton into the medicine.
Insert the applicator with the cotton into a tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Repeat this process until you achieve the desired cauterization of the “grape,” then leave it as it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, do so.
After cauterization, wipe around the “grape” with cotton soaked in fat, drying the surrounding medicine. The patient then rinses with cold water and is treated externally with poultices and internally with gargles until healed; this type of treatment is safer than excision and less worrisome.
The uvula may also be treated in a gentler way than cauterization and excision, with fumigation as follows: take mint, hyssop, thyme, rue, wormwood, chamomile, yarrow, and similar herbs, gather them all or some in a pot, and immerse in vinegar.
Boil the pot, sealed with clay, and in the center of the lid place a perforation fitted with a hollow instrument shaped as follows, made of silver or copper:.
Insert the end with the bulb into the patient’s mouth, allowing steam to rise to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is well softened. Repeat this several times until it withers. Take care not to perform this treatment at the onset of swelling.
As it often exacerbates the swelling, it should only be done when the hot swelling has subsided. If this instrument is not available, take a reed and attach an eggshell to the end to prevent the patient’s mouth from burning.
The eggshell prevents the steam’s heat from burning the mouth, making this a safe and effective treatment.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On the Removal of Thorns and Other Objects Lodged in the Throat.
It is common for a bone, fish spine, or other objects to become lodged in the throat. You should remove anything visible to the eye after pressing down the tongue with the instrument in sunlight.
So you can see what’s in the throat. If it is not visible and is hidden in the throat, induce vomiting in the patient before his food is digested, as the lodged object may come out. Alternatively, have him swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce stalk.
Or have him swallow a bite of dry bread, or take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it with a string, and have him swallow it. When it reaches the place of the thorn, quickly pull the string, repeating this several times.
Often, the thorn or bone will adhere to it and be removed. If it does not come out with the mentioned methods, then use a lead instrument shaped as follows:.
It is slightly thicker than an applicator and has a hook at the end. The patient inserts it gently into his throat while tilting his head upward, being cautious not to touch his larynx to avoid coughing, pushing out the bone or thorn, or the doctor can insert it by hand.
It is preferable for the patient to insert it himself, as he knows the exact location of the lodged object. He either pushes downward or pulls his hand with the tool upward, according to what is suitable, until it is removed.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On removing the leech lodged in the throat.
If you have treated the leech as mentioned in the division on medication and it was ineffective, then examine the patient’s throat under sunlight after pressing down their tongue with the instrument I have described to you.
If your sight falls upon the leech, pull it with a small hook or a fine, precise forceps; if you cannot, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient’s throat near the leech, then insert a fire-heated rod inside the tube.
Do this several times, and have the patient abstain from water for the entire day; then take a basin filled with cold water, open their mouth in it, rinse but do not swallow any of it, and stir the water from time to time with their hand.
The leech will fall into position when it senses the water; if it does not come out with the aforementioned methods, fumigate the throat with urine and asafetida using the instrument I described for fumigating the uvula. Do this several times, and it will fall.
The method for fumigation is to take a vessel containing burning coals, covered with a lid with a hole in the middle, in which you place the tip of the instrument; then, insert the fumigant, and the patient places their mouth at the end of the tube, closing their mouth so that the smoke does not escape until they feel that the smoke has reached their throat.
The leech will fall into position; if it does not fall, repeat the fumigation several times, have the patient endure thirst, eat salty food and garlic, and avoid drinking water, for with this regimen it must come out. This is the image of the tool used to extract the leech from the throat if it becomes visible.
It resembles hooks, as you can see, but it has this curvature that enters the throat, and its tips resemble a bird’s beak, with the roughness of a file; once it grasps something, it will not release it.
And there is another tool for pressing the tongue: a wide iron ring, just large enough to fit over the tongue in the mouth, held in place on its side, keeping the mouth open involuntarily, and the patient cannot remove it until you do.
Description of the instrument that opens the mouth with this exact measurement.
Chapter Forty.
On the discussion of incising and cutting open swellings.
The swellings are of many different types, as will be mentioned one by one in this book, and they differ in their incision and cutting in two respects: first, by the type of swelling itself and what it contains in terms of fluids.
The second type is based on the locations in the body where they occur, for a swelling that appears in the head differs from one in the anus, and a swelling in a fleshy area differs from one in a joint, each requiring its own method of treatment.
Some swellings should not be incised except after their pus has fully matured, while others should be incised while still fresh and not fully mature, such as swellings near the joints.
This is because if a swelling occurs near a joint and remains untreated until the surrounding area decays, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, possibly leading to the impairment of that limb, or if the swelling is near a vital organ.
If you delay its incision until it matures, you could harm that vital organ; or, if it is near the anus, you should incise it while fresh, as it is necessary to incise a partially mature swelling near the anus to prevent deep decay from penetrating inside, leading to fistula formation.
This can become a permanent condition without recovery. You should recognize the time to incise swellings that have fully matured, which is when the swelling pain subsides, fever diminishes, redness and throbbing reduce, and the head of the swelling becomes indented, along with other signs.
You should aim the incision at the lowest point of the swelling, if possible, so that it allows easier drainage downward, or at the thinnest, most protruding part of the swelling. The incision should run lengthwise with the body if the swelling is in areas like the hands or feet.
The locations of the muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries are, generally, in all flat areas that do not bend. But in those that bend, the incision should be made according to that spot. And if the swelling is in the fleshy areas, it is best to avoid incision.
Until it fully matures as we have said, for if you incise it before that, the pus will flow for a long time and it will contain much filth and dirt, and sometimes its edges become hard and depressed. Some swellings may be incised across the body when necessary or according to what the organ needs.
For small swellings, one incision should be used, and for large swellings, a wider incision or multiple cuts, depending on the size of the swelling. There are cases where the skin needs to be hollowed out and removed if it has become like a piece of cloth.
And it reaches the point where it has died, as is seen in many abscesses and swellings. Some of these are incised with a three-cornered incision, and some are cut in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like an inguinal swelling.
Some require a circular incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and other similar incisions. For those without a head, like smooth, flat swellings, only a simple incision should be made. If the swelling is large and has accumulated pus over time and you incise it, do not rush to extract all the pus at once.
Instead, extract some of it, then wrap the swelling until the next day, then extract more pus. Repeat this gradually until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a small child, or an elderly person, for the vital spirit may often weaken with the sudden release of pus, and the patient might die without you realizing. Be extremely cautious in this matter.
After incising these swellings, you should clean the wound and examine it. If the wound is small or a single simple incision, use twisted cotton or old cotton. If the swelling is large and has many incisions.
You should insert a piece of wick into each incision until they meet each other. If part of the skin of the swelling is cut or hollowed out, you should pack it with old cotton or linen fringe without moisture and bind it until the third day.
Then, remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during the procedure, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them and apply it repeatedly to the bleeding site.
If the bleeding persists, you should apply the management, treatment, and powders that we have described in many parts of this book and its sections. If it is winter and the swelling site has many nerves, you should moisten the bandages with hot wine and oil.
And place them on the site. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply bandages soaked in water and oil or in wine and oil, all of which should be cold. On the third day, as we have said, the swelling should be untied and cleaned.
And use the appropriate treatment until it heals. This is what you need to know about treating swellings in general, and as for specific methods, I have detailed each swelling, its treatment method, in an organized and summarized manner.
Chapter Forty-One.
On Incising the Swellings that Appear on the Scalp.
Small swellings appear on the scalp; these are types of cysts surrounded by membranes that are like a chicken’s gizzard. They come in many types: some are fatty, some contain fluid resembling mud.
Some contain fluid similar to porridge or broth and the like, and some are hardened and solid. All of them are safe to incise and remove unless an artery is encountered during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the tool, the image of which will follow, called "the probe," to determine their contents. If it contains fluid, incise it longitudinally with a simple incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from line ~B~ to line ~C~. Once the fluid is drained, remove the sac that contained that fluid entirely; leave nothing behind at all, as it often recurs if any part remains.
Then, dip cotton in the Egyptian ointment if available, or in salt water, and fill the wound with it, leaving it until the next day, as it will consume what remains of the sac. Then reapply the cotton with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time if needed.
Until you are certain that none of the sac remains, at which point treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains a fatty cyst, incise it in this manner:
With a cross-shaped incision, place hooks in the edges of the wound and peel it from all sides, trying your best to remove the membrane that contains it. If an artery is encountered, proceed as I have described. Do the same for a hardened swelling with the incision.
The treatment is exactly as I have described. Incising the hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and fluid, and some of these swellings on the head of some people contain no fluid at all; as I once incised a swelling that
The head of an old woman, where I found the tumor to be as hard as solid stone, rough, white, which could not be broken, and if thrown, it would shatter. Other tumors occurring in the head, aside from this one, are like the tumors that appear on the heads of children.
And at the bases of the ears, make a simple incision on all of them and ensure that the cut is made from the bottom to facilitate the flow of the matter downward, then treat it with the appropriate remedy.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On the incision of tumors (swelling) that appear in the neck, these tumors often occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins. They may also appear throughout the body, sometimes occurring individually in the neck and other times in multiples, each generated from another.
Each of these tumors is contained within its own sheath, like cysts and head tumors as we have described. There are various types of these tumors: some are hardened, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and unresponsive to treatment.
If you observe one that feels good to the touch, with an appearance close to skin color, moving in every direction, not adhered to any neck nerve, vein, or artery, and is not deeply embedded. Then you should make a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this manner, from line ~J~ to line ~B~.
Remove it from all directions, stretching the edges of the skin with a hook or two, or with multiple hooks if necessary, as we described with head tumors, and remove it gradually. Be careful not to cut any vein or nerve, and ensure the scalpel is not too sharp.
To avoid accidentally cutting further or disturbing the patient and cutting unnecessary parts; if you cut a vein or artery and it hinders the operation, place powdered alum or some powder that stops bleeding in the wound.
Bind the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides, and the wound softens and begins to show signs of festering. Once the bleeding stops, return to your work until you finish. Then examine with your index finger if there remain any small tumors, cutting and clearing them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the tumor, you should not cut it from its root. Instead, tie it firmly with a doubled thread and leave it until it falls off naturally without harm. Then pack the wound with worn cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, and treat it.
If you cut off the entire tumor, you should bring together the edges of the wound and stitch it immediately, ensuring that no residue remains. If you find any remnants due to the tumor's size.
Then you should target cutting its root and base, applying stitching as mentioned. If the tumors contain fluids, make a simple incision at the site where it appears ripe, directing the cut downward as we said.
Then, after the incision, use twisting with Egyptian ointment or similar to consume the remaining decay. Once you see the wound is cleansed, treat it with flesh-regenerating ointments until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On incision of the larynx for a tumor that occurs inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision of the larynx, but I have not seen anyone perform it in our country. This is the course of their words. As for those with diphtheria, they should avoid laryngeal incisions, as they do not benefit from it.
This is because all the veins and lungs are in poor condition. But for those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no illness in the windpipe, a laryngeal incision must be used to avoid the harm that comes from suffocation.
If we want to perform this, we should make a small transverse incision under three or four circles of the windpipe, between two rings, to the extent that the incision is in the membrane, not the cartilage. This spot is suitable for incision.
This is because it lacks flesh, and blood vessels are far from it. If the surgeon is fearful, he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then make an incision until he reaches the windpipe, avoiding blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the membrane we described and can identify the incision in the windpipe by the phlegm that exits from it and by the voice cessation. Leave the wound open for a time, and when the critical period for suffocation passes, close the edges of the wound in the skin.
Stitch it without involving the cartilage, then apply medications that regenerate flesh until it heals. The author of this book said that the explanation of this statement is when they see that one of these mentioned tumors has obstructed the patient’s throat.
And when the patient approaches death, fearing his breath will stop, they resort to the incision of the larynx so the patient can breathe slightly from the wound site and be saved from death. They instructed to keep the wound open until the peak of the illness passes, which typically lasts around three days.
Then they ordered the stitching and treatment of the wound until it healed. What I witnessed myself was a servant who took a knife and slashed her own throat, cutting part of the windpipe. I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning like a slaughtered animal, so I examined the wound.
I found the blood that came from the wound to be slight, so I was certain she hadn’t cut a vein or jugular. Air was coming out of the wound, so I quickly stitched and treated the wound until it healed. The servant experienced nothing except a slight hoarseness in her voice, nothing more.
And after a few days, she returned to her best condition, so we say that incising the throat holds no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the incision of the tumor that appears externally on the throat, called the "elephant throat."
This tumor, known as the "elephant throat," is a large swelling the color of the body, common in women, and has two types.
It can either be natural or accidental; as for the natural type, there is no treatment, but the accidental one has two forms: one resembling fatty tumors and the other resembling a swelling from artery contraction, which is dangerous to incise. You should not use iron on it at all except if it is small; probe it with a spatula, and if it resembles a fatty tumor and is not connected to any veins, then incise it as you would with fatty growths. Remove it along with its sac if it is in one; otherwise, completely excise it and treat the area with the necessary remedies.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On the incision of different types of tumors.
There are many types of tumors, and I have mentioned all of them in the classification; here we should explain the difference between a tumor and an abscess, as it is confusing. I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat, fever, and severe pain until the excess cools down. Then the infection completes, and the fever and intensity subside, while the tumor has no heat, fever, or pain; it is enclosed in a membrane sac, a specific container for it, and matches the color of the body. It starts as small as a chickpea and can grow as large as a watermelon or smaller.
It has two types, either fatty or containing fluid; the colors of fluid are numerous as I mentioned in the classification. When treating the tumor, you should first probe and examine it with the instrument called the spatula, as illustrated in the following section.
Estimate the tumor’s size, then remove the spatula and observe what follows; if fluid of any color flows out, make a simple incision as I described with other swellings. If no fluid follows the spatula, then it is fatty.
Make a cross-shaped incision on it as I have taught you; attach it with hooks and gently separate the skin from all sides, keeping the sac intact if possible so you can remove it entirely with the tumor.
If the sac tears during the procedure and you cannot remove it whole, as often happens, take it out piece by piece so nothing remains, for if any of it remains, large or small, the tumor will likely recur.
If you are unable to remove a small remaining part, pack the wound with a caustic powder, bind the wound, and apply a cooling remedy for the hot swelling, then treat it with other medications until it heals. If the tumor is large, suture its edges and treat it with healing compounds.
If a pulsating or non-pulsating vein is in the way and causes bleeding, quickly pack the area with powdered alum, bind it for two or three days until the wound festers and the blood flow calms, then return to remove what remains of the tumor.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On the illustrations of instruments.
Used in incisions and lancing, including illustrations of spatulas, which come in three types: large, medium, and small.
Illustration of a large spatula.
Illustration of a medium spatula.
Illustration of a small spatula.
Made from steel with square, firm edges for swift entry into swellings. These are illustrations of probes, called "bard," also in three types: large, medium, and small. Illustration of a large probe.
Illustration of a medium probe.
Illustration of a small probe.
Suitable for probing swellings, wounds, fistulas, and hidden areas to locate any bones within, crafted as round, smooth rods like needles, from Chinese brass, ispadruri, brass, iron, or silver, with ispadruri being the best.
Some probes are also made from black lead, suitable for probing fistulas with curved depths, as they bend flexibly to match the curves, and these too come in three types: long, medium, and short.
According to the depth needed for each fistula, with thickness proportional to the fistula's width or narrowness. Illustration of a large lead probe.
Illustration of a medium lead probe.
Illustration of a small lead probe.
Illustrations of hooks, of which there are many types. Some are simple, meaning they have one hook, in three types: large, medium, and small. There are also blind hooks, also three types, double-hooked ones, and curved double-hooked ones. There are three types, and there are hooks with three prongs, also three types, each needed for specific procedures. Illustration of a large simple hook. Illustration of a medium simple hook. Illustration of a small simple hook.

Illustration of a large triple-pronged hook.
Illustration of a medium triple-pronged hook. Illustration of a small triple-pronged hook.
These are images of scalpels used to cut and peel tumors and swellings; there are three types because there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel:.
Image of a medium scalpel:.
Image of a small scalpel:.
Their blades, which are used to cut, are sharp, while the other edges are not sharp. They are made this way to help with peeling the tumor in cases where there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient feels some relief from the burning sensation experienced during the peeling of the tumor.
These are images of cauteries, which are of three types because there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large cautery:.
They are made of copper, resembling the kohl stick, with one end shaped like a wide, double-layered spoon that has the scalpel blade hidden in it. It resembles a bird’s tongue and can be moved inward and outward as desired, as you can see.
Images of bistouries that are hidden between the fingers when opening tumors so that the patient does not feel them; there are three types, as there are large, medium, and small ones. Image of a large bistoury:.
Images of cupping tools used to stop blood flow; they are three types, with large, medium, and small ones. Image of a large cupping tool:.
They are made of copper or porcelain, rounded and slightly elongated, as you see, and should be thin. You should have these types of cupping tools in large and small sizes to quickly stop blood flow when necessary, especially if medication is unavailable.
However, they should not be used to stop blood flow in all parts of the body but only in fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, abdomen, and groin, as well as similar moist, fleshy parts.
Smaller instruments resembling pistachio shells can also be made in this form:.
They are used to stop blood when it flows from the site of bloodletting or when a vein or artery is cut, and some of them are made in a rounded shape like this:.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On Treating the Male Breast.
Some people's breasts may swell upon reaching puberty and resemble female breasts, remaining as an unsightly swelling. For those who dislike this, the breast should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision like this:.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~:. Then remove all the fat, fill the wound with healing medication, bring the edges of the wound together with stitches, and treat it until it heals. If the breast sags downward and relaxes due to its size, as happens in women,
You should make two crescent-shaped incisions in the upper sides, each connecting to the other at the ends, so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one like this:. From line ~B~ to line ~C~, then remove the skin between the incisions, remove the fat, and use the stitches and powdered medications we mentioned, along with any other necessary treatment, until it heals.
If you cannot fully remove what you need to cut due to the patient's discomfort or excessive bleeding, pack the wound with cotton soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On Opening Tumors that Appear Under the Armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the hardened "swinish" type, enclosed in a sac, with some containing fluids. If they contain fluids, they should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision like this:.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~. When you have drained all the pus from the tumor, pack it with worn cotton and leave it for another day, then remove the cotton.
Treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the "swine node" type, incise it as we described for swine nodes. If the wound continues to produce pus, apply cauterization as previously explained.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On Incising a Tumor that Arises from an Artery or Vein, Called Aneurysm.
If an artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, a tumor often appears as a result, and the same can happen to a vein, leading to swelling and inflation.
The signs by which you can tell whether the swelling and inflation are due to an artery or vein are as follows: if it originates from an artery, the tumor will be elongated and deep in the body, and if you press it with your finger, you will feel it as though it has a crackling sound.
If it is from a vein, the tumor will be rounded and close to the surface of the body. Incising such tumors is risky, especially those in the armpit, groin, neck, and various other places in the body, particularly if they are very large, so you should avoid treating them with a blade.
Likewise, avoid those that are located in the limbs or head. If there is swelling at the opening of an artery, make a longitudinal incision in the skin, open the incision with hooks, then strip the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it, passing it through to the other side, and tie the artery with a double-thread suture in two places, as I explained for ligating the arteries in the temples. Then, with a bistoury, pierce the area between the two ligatures to release all the blood contained in it.
The swelling dissolves, then you use the treatment that produces pus until the bindings fall off, then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is due to a vein incision, you should hold as much of the swelling and skin as you can with your hand, then insert a needle below the place you held with your hand, passing it through with a doubled thread until it exits on the other side. Then tie the swelling tightly with it, as I have described to you in tying a grape from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear the threads might slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling at the intersection of the first needle.
Tighten your threads at four points, then cut the swelling in the middle until its contents come out, then cut off the excess skin and leave what is tied. Then place a dressing dipped in wine and oil over it. Then use the treatment that involves twisting and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the swelling that occurs due to nerve twisting.
Just as swelling occurs in the artery and vein, swelling also occurs in the nerve if there is an impact or excessive fatigue or the like, and it mostly appears in the wrist and heel areas.
In any place where the joints move, there is a hard swelling resembling the color of the rest of the body, and it is usually painless. When pressed firmly, the patient feels a kind of numbness, and the swelling does not accumulate deep in the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in all directions but does not go forward or backward. If it is in the joints, it should not be approached with iron as it may cause long-term damage, and if it is in the head or forehead.
Then cut the skin with a scalpel. If the swelling is small, hold it with forceps and cut it from the base. If it is large, hook it with a snare, flay it, then remove it, close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On removing warts that appear in the abdomen.
Some people frequently develop warts in their abdomen and other parts of their body, known as "fungal" due to their resemblance to mushrooms, with a thin base and a thick head, with lips that have transformed. Some are small, while others grow very large.
I once saw a man with two warts in his abdomen that were very much like mushrooms—no difference—white, thin at the base, with cracked, transformed lips, and constantly oozing moisture. I removed them, with one weighing about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces.
To remove them, examine if the patient is moist and the wart is white, moist, and thin at the base. If so, cut it with a wide scalpel, and have cauterizing irons heated in the fire nearby, as a lot of blood often flows upon removal.
If the blood overwhelms you, cauterize it immediately. If you find the patient is cowardly and afraid of cutting with iron, take a well-tied lead thread, tighten it around the wart with these features, and leave it for two days, then increase the tightening of the lead, and keep tightening it.
As it affects the wart, continue until it detaches and falls off by itself without intervention. If the wart is thick at the base, cutting it involves some risk and danger, especially in the abdomen, but it is possible to cut half of it or a portion.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, and treat the wound until it heals. Beware of attempting to remove a wart that is dark in color, has little sensation, and is unsightly in appearance, as it is a cancerous tumor. We will discuss cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On treating navel protrusion.
A navel protrusion can have many causes: either from a tear in the abdominal membrane, causing fat or intestines to protrude as with other hernias, from blood emanating from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or from trapped gas.
If it is due to a tear in the membrane and the release of fat, the color of the swelling resembles the color of the body, is soft, painless, and appears in different shapes. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, then its position will differ significantly from what we described. When you press it with your fingers, it disappears, then returns, and may be accompanied by a gurgling sound. It often enlarges considerably in the bath or with severe fatigue. If it is caused by moisture, it will be soft.
It does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, the swelling darkens with these signs. If it is due to growing flesh, the swelling will be firm, hard, and will remain constant in size.
If it is caused by wind, it will feel soft to the touch, and the procedure is to examine whether the navel protrusion is due to blood from the artery, vein, or wind. You should avoid treating it as there is risk and danger in it, as I informed you in the chapter where I discussed tumors arising from the artery and vein.
If the navel protrusion is due to the intestines or omentum, you should instruct the patient to hold his breath and stand upright, then mark around the entire navel with ink. Then instruct him to lie on his back before you, and incise with a wide scalpel around the navel in the area marked with ink, then pull the middle of the tumor upwards with a large hook, and firmly tie the incision site with a strong thread or silk string.
Make a loop with the tie, then open the middle of the tightened tumor above the tie, and insert your index finger into it to locate the intestine. If you find that the intestine is caught by the tie, loosen the loop and push the intestine back inside the abdomen. If you find omentum, pull it out with a hook.
Cut off the excess. If you encounter an artery or vein, firmly ligate it, and return to your work. Take two needles with two strong threads, and insert the needles into the incision made around the tumor, crossing them over each other, then secure the tumor at four points around the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the site until the tightened flesh decomposes and falls off on its own, or cut it when it becomes thin and decayed, then treat it with the necessary ointments until it heals. If the navel protrusion is due to flesh that has grown within it.
Or if it is due to moisture, you should hollow out the tumor as we said, and drain the blood or moisture found within, then treat it with something that seals the site.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the Treatment of Cancer.
We mentioned in the categorization the types of cancer and how to treat it with medications, and the warning against treating it with iron to avoid ulceration, as well as mentioning cancer originating in the womb and the warning against treating it.
The ancients stated that whenever cancer is in a location where it can be entirely excised, such as cancer in the breast, thigh, or similar organs from which it can be wholly removed, especially if it is small and early. But if it has advanced and become large, you should not approach it.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me who has succeeded in this. The procedure, if feasible as we said, is to first purge the patient of black bile multiple times, then bloodlet if there is evident fullness in the veins.
Then position the patient in a posture conducive to the procedure, then insert hooks suitable for the cancer, and hollow it out from all directions along with the skin, thoroughly, so no root remains. Let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.
Instead, press on the area and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with available instruments. If during the procedure, you encounter heavy bleeding from a severed artery or vein, cauterize the vessel to stop the blood flow, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Four.
On the Treatment of Dropsy.
We have explained in the categorization the types of dropsy, the accumulation of water, the symptoms of each type, and treatment with medications. The only type treated with iron is the sac-like dropsy, and iron should not be used for the drum-like or fleshy types at all.
For that is fatal. If you have treated this sac-like dropsy with medications and your treatment was ineffective, then consider: if the patient has become severely weakened, or has another disease besides dropsy, such as a cough, diarrhea, or similar.
If there is a cough, diarrhea, or similar, avoid treating him with iron, as it is hazardous. If the patient appears strong and has no other illness besides dropsy alone, is neither a child nor an elderly person, the procedure is to have the patient stand before you. With an assistant behind him pressing on his abdomen with his hands to push the water downward toward the pubic area, then you take a spiked scalpel shaped like this:
Sharp on both sides, long, and pointed like a scalpel, but with a slight blunting to prevent it from penetrating the intestines during the procedure and causing harm. Then observe, if the dropsy originates from the intestines.
You should make an incision three fingers’ width below the navel, aligned just above the pubic region. If the swelling originates from a liver condition, make the incision three fingers to the left of the navel. If it arises from a spleen condition, make the incision on the right side, three fingers' width.
The incision should also not be on the side where the patient wishes to lie, to prevent fluids from draining into that weakened area. Then, pierce the entire skin with the instrument, insert the instrument into the incision, and lift your hand.
With the scalpel, slide between the skin and membrane as if you are flaying it, removing as much as the size of a fingernail or similar. Then, pierce the membrane until the scalpel reaches an empty area, which is the location of the water. Then, remove it and insert into the hole the instrument, which is shaped like this.
It resembles a thin tube made from silver, copper, or smooth, polished wood. It has a small hole at the bottom and three holes on the sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you can see.
One end is sharpened in the shape of a pen tip, resembling this form:.
There is a ring at the upper end. When the instrument reaches the water, it drains immediately through the instrument. Extract a moderate amount of water at once, for if you withdraw too much, the patient may die from the dissolution of their vital spirit.
Or the patient may experience fainting close to death. Therefore, drain only according to their strength, as indicated by their pulse strength and healthy color. Then, remove the instrument and retain the water, for it stops immediately.
This is due to the skin that holds the hole in the membrane, which I mentioned should be incised in that manner. Then, reinsert the instrument another day if you deem the patient can bear it.
And also withdraw a small amount of water, doing this for several days, observing caution to avoid mistakes until only a small amount of water remains. If you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand.
Encourage sweating in the bath and sun, and make him endure thirst, and treat him with drying medicines until he recovers. Then, cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after the water has been extracted as I previously described.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On treating children who are born with an unpierced urinary opening, or if the opening is narrow or in an incorrect position.
Some infants are born with an unpierced urethra, so it is necessary to pierce it immediately upon birth.
Using a very fine scalpel, shaped like this:.
Then place a thin lead pin in the hole, tie and secure it for three or four days. Whenever he needs to urinate, remove it, let him urinate, and then replace it. If you do not use the lead, the urine passing over the spot may prevent it from closing.
For a narrow hole, treat it with lead as we mentioned for many days until it widens. For those whose opening is in an incorrect position, for example, some are born with the opening at the end of the urethra and cannot urinate forward.
He has to lift the urethra upward by hand, and he will not be able to conceive, as the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line. This is a very serious defect. The procedure is to have the patient lie on his back.
Then, stretch his urethra strongly with your left hand, and sharpen the head of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel, like a pen's point or as if carving something, to make it protrude like a dome, with the hole properly positioned in the center.
Be cautious about blood loss during the procedure, as it often occurs. Use what stops bleeding, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On the ulcer that appears on the foreskin, urethra, darkening, degeneration, and adhesion of the foreskin to the urethra.
This ulcer frequently appears on the urethra as a repulsive fleshy growth. It can be benign or malignant. For the benign one, you should hook it with a fine instrument.
Then cut it completely to clean it, and apply a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment. Then, treat it with palm ointment until it heals. If the ulcer is malignant with a foul color, use cauterization after cutting and stripping it.
If the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, with part of the ulcer inside and part outside the foreskin, you should first remove the inner ulcer. Once it heals, then treat the external part.
Because if you treat both together, you do not avoid the risk of perforation of the foreskin, and also there may appear in the testicles and the foreskin blackening and decay, so you should gouge out everything that has blackened or seems likely to decay or has already decayed.
Then, apply to it honey mixed with pounded, sifted pomegranate peel and barley flour, then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped tool in this manner:.
For cauterization is useful for both conditions, meaning both bleeding and a wound that has decayed. If the glans is eroded and entirely gone at some time, you should insert a lead tube into the urinary tract for the patient to urinate through; as for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans.
This adhesion occurs in those with an intact foreskin who do not require circumcision, and adhesion may happen due to an injury or swelling, so you should separate it with a blunt scalpel until the connection is loosened and the glans is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to clearly distinguish it, you should separate a bit of both the glans and the foreskin, as the foreskin is thin and may quickly be perforated due to its thinness. Then, separate the foreskin from the glans with a thin piece of linen soaked in cold water to prevent it from re-adhering.
Then treat it with an astringent solution until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
On the purification of boys and the treatment of errors that may occur to them.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of a connection, like other surgeries, except that, as it is performed by our choice and specifically used in boys, we should establish the best method for it.
And the easiest, safest method. I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their writings, as it was not practiced in their laws, and it is something we have acquired.
Through experience, I found that most craftsmen and barbers use purification with a razor or scissors, the clamp, tying with thread, and cutting with the fingernail, and I have tried all these methods.
But I have found nothing better than purification with scissors and tying with thread, as purification with a razor often causes the skin to cling, as the foreskin has two layers, and the upper layer may be cut while the lower layer remains.
This necessitates another cut and renewed pain. Purification with the clamp risks cutting the tip of the urethra, as it may enter its hole. As for purification with the fingernail, the skin may slip, spoiling your work, or the boy's skin may be naturally short.
Many are born this way and do not need purification; I have seen this. As for purification with scissors and tying with thread, experience has revealed its advantages to me, as the scissors cut evenly, with the upper blade like the lower blade.
When you squeeze your hand, aligning the two blades, they cut evenly and at the same time. The thread loop thus forms a kind of barrier around the skin of the urethra on all sides, preventing any error. First, the method is to give the boy the impression.
Especially if he understands a little, that you are only tying the thread around his penis and will leave it until the next day. Then, cheer him up in every way you can, according to what his mind accepts, and stand him in front of you upright.
He should not be sitting. Hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so the boy does not see them or any of the tools. Then place your hand on his penis, blow into the skin, and lift it upwards until the head of the urethra emerges.
Then, clean it of any dirt that has collected, then tie the marked spot with a doubled thread, and tie a second knot a little below it. Hold the lower tied area firmly with your thumb and forefinger, and cut between the two knots. Then, lift the skin upwards quickly, and expose the head of the urethra. Let the blood flow briefly; this is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle it with burnt gourd ash, which is the best I have tried, or fine flour, which is also excellent.
Then, lift the skin upwards quickly, and expose the head of the urethra. Let the blood flow briefly; this is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle it with burnt gourd ash, which is the best I have tried, or fine flour, which is also excellent. Then, apply a dusting of powder with a cloth soaked in the yolk of an egg boiled in rose water and beaten with fresh, good-quality rose oil. Leave it on until the next day, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
Here is the design of the scissors suitable for purification:.
They should be blunt and sharp, without any curve, tempered at the screw, and the length of the blades should be equal to the length of the handles. As for mistakes that may occur in purification, the inner skin may turn entirely or partially when cut, so you should stretch it immediately with your fingernail before the area swells.
And cut it evenly. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days pass and what is beneath the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the hot swelling subsides, and then gently peel it.
Cut it as circumstances allow, and take care with the head of the urethra. If something is cut from the head of the urethra, it does no harm; treat it with the wound-healing powders we have described in the section on powders.
If an excessive amount of skin is cut, causing it to retract upwards, this also does not cause much harm; treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
On the treatment of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs due to an obstruction from a stone, clotted blood, pus, growing flesh, or similar causes. If you treat this with the methods we described among the forms of treatment outlined in the division.
And if the urine does not flow, and you observe that its retention is due to a stone lodged in the neck of the bladder, then make the patient kneel on his knees, with another person sitting on his back, pressing his abdomen to his back, while the patient holds himself as best he can.
At this point, the neck of the bladder is forced to push the stone back, allowing the urine to flow. If it does not flow by this method, and the patient's condition becomes severe, you should employ extraction with an instrument called the catheter, whose image is as follows:
It is made of silver, thin, smooth, and hollow like a bird’s feather, slender as a probe, about a span and a half in length, with a delicate funnel at its head. To draw urine with it, take a doubled thread and tie a piece of wool or cotton firmly at its end.
Insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the catheter, and trim any excess wool with scissors so that it fits snugly into the tube like a button. Then, lubricate the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white, and seat the patient on a chair.
Anoint his bladder and urethra with moist oils or warm oil and water, then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches its root. Then bend the urethra upward towards the navel and push the catheter inside.
Continue bending the urethra until you push the catheter inside; when it reaches near the rectum, tilt the penis downward with the catheter inside, and push it until it reaches the bladder. The patient will feel that it has reached an empty space.
This is done in this manner because the passage through which urine flows has a curve. Then, gently pull the thread with the wool, and the urine will follow the wool; remove it, and the urine will flow. Then, reinsert the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
The instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or ivory, hollow, with a long tube slender as pus, and if you wish to drip water and medicines into it, this is done with an instrument called a syringe. Its image is as follows:
It is made of silver or ivory, hollow, with a long tube slender as a probe, entirely hollow except at the tip, which is solid, having three holes—two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
The hollow part where the plunger is inserted is sized just to seal it without excess so that when you draw in moisture, it is suctioned, and when you push, it is expelled over a distance, like the sprayer used to project naphtha in naval warfare.
When you want to release moisture into the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the liquid and pull the plunger up, drawing the liquid into the syringe. Then insert its tip into the urethra, as we described for the catheter, and push the liquid with the plunger.
Thus, the liquid reaches the bladder promptly until the patient feels it, and here is an image of a delicate syringe also used to inject the bladder.
It is made of silver or ebony, with an upper end resembling a small funnel and a notch below it to secure a tie. Then take a camel's bladder, place the liquid you wish to inject into the bladder, and fasten it securely between the barriers with a doubled thread.
Warm that liquid slightly over the fire, then insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra. Press your hand firmly on the bladder containing the liquid until the patient senses that the liquid has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder available, take a piece of parchment, fashion it into a circle, and puncture it around the edges. Then insert a strong thread through those holes as it circles, gathering the circle as you would a napkin after placing in it the desired liquids, oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument, and use it as you would a bladder by pressing your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the extraction of stones.
We have mentioned in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and I have explained the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder and the signs of each of these, as well as the stones that require surgical intervention by hand and incision.
These are specifically stones formed in the bladder and those lodged in the urethra, and I will describe that with clear explanation and brevity.
I say that stones formed in the bladder most commonly affect boys, and among their signs is that urine exits the bladder, resembling water in its thinness.
Sand appears in the urine, and he scratches his genital area and fiddles with it, and it often swells and then subsides, with the rectum protruding in many of them. Children heal from it easily until they reach fourteen years of age, it is difficult to heal in the elderly, and as for young men, they fall somewhere in between.
The larger the stone, the easier the treatment, and the smaller the stone, the opposite. When we proceed to the treatment, the patient should first be given an enema to expel all waste from his intestines, as it may prevent detection of the stone during examination.
Then the patient should be taken by the legs, shaken, and lowered downward to make the stone descend to the neck of the bladder, or he should jump from a high place several times, then sit him upright before you with his hands under his thighs so that the bladder tilts entirely downward, and then examine him.
Feel from the outside, and if you sense the stone in the space, immediately make the incision. If it is not within your touch at all, the index finger of the left hand should be oiled if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is fully grown.
If he is a fully-grown youth, insert the finger into his rectum and search for the stone until it is under your finger, then gradually move it toward the neck of the bladder, press on it with your finger, and push it outward toward the spot where you intend to make the incision.
And you instruct one servant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another servant to extend the testicles upward with his right hand, while with his other hand, he pulls the skin under the testicles away from the area where the incision will be made; then you take the scalpel that has this form:
You make an incision between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle but toward the left side of the buttock, with the incision directly over the stone, while your finger is in the anus, pressing it outward at an angle so the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, just enough for the stone to pass through.
No larger, as sometimes the finger in the anus presses the stone toward the incision, allowing it to pass without difficulty; know that some stones have angles and edges, which can make them harder to remove.
Some are smooth and resemble acorns, making them easy to remove, while those with angles and edges require a slightly larger incision; if it still doesn't come out this way, you may need to maneuver it, either by grasping it with a strong forceps with a file-like tip.
To grip the stone securely so it does not slip, or by inserting a slender instrument with a hooked end underneath it; if this is still difficult, slightly enlarge the incision, and if excess bleeding occurs, stop it with alum.
If there is more than one, push the largest stone first to the mouth of the bladder, then cut to extract it, followed by the smaller stones, if there are more than two; if one is extremely large, making a large incision to remove it is unwise, as it could cause one of two complications for the patient.
Either the patient may die, or he could suffer from constant urinary dribbling, as the site may not heal at all; instead, attempt to push it out, or manipulate it with hooks to break it into pieces and remove it bit by bit.
When you finish your work, pack the wound with frankincense, aloe, and myrrh, bind it, and place a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water, over it to reduce the hot swelling; then have the patient lie on his back, and do not loosen the dressing until the third day.
When the dressing is loosened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with palm ointment and basilicum ointment until it heals; if excessive hot swelling, ulceration, or complications like blood clotting in the bladder occur, blocking urine flow, this can be identified by blood in the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound to remove the blood, as if it remains, it may cause the bladder to deteriorate and become infected; then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, treating each complication with the appropriate remedy until it heals.
During all times of treatment, bind the thighs together to secure the medicines placed on the wound; if the stone is small and has lodged in the urethra, blocking urine flow, treat it with the method I am about to describe before resorting to an incision.
I have often avoided incisions with this treatment, as I have tried it successfully; it involves using a steel probe that looks like this:.
A triangular, pointed end embedded in a handle; then, you take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, then gently insert the probe into the urethra until it reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the probe with your hand in the stone itself, little by little, aiming to pierce it through to the other side so that urine begins to flow immediately; then press down on any remaining stone from outside the penis, as it will crumble and pass with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not possible due to an obstacle, tie a thread below the stone and another above it, then make an incision on the stone within the penis between the two threads, and extract it.
Then untie the binding and clean out any clotted blood that has formed in the wound; the thread below the stone is necessary to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the upper thread ensures that when you release it after removing the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, you should, when tying the upper thread, lift the skin upwards so that it returns when you are finished and covers the wound as we mentioned.
Chapter sixty-one.
On the removal of stones for women.
Stones rarely form in women, and if one of them has a stone, treating it is difficult and often impossible for various reasons: first, because the woman may be a virgin, and second, because it is rare to find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is modest or a relative, and third, because it is rare to find a woman skilled in this art, especially in the hands-on work; and fourth, the site of incision for the stone in women is far from the stone itself, requiring a deep incision.
This is risky, so if necessary, one should enlist a skilled female physician, though they are rare; if not available, seek a chaste, gentle male physician, or bring a midwife skilled in women’s matters or a woman with some knowledge of this procedure.
Bring her and instruct her to follow all your commands for searching the stone first; if the woman is a virgin, she should insert a finger into her rectum and search for the stone, and if she finds it, press it under her finger.
At that point, instruct her to make an incision over it; if the woman is not a virgin but a widow, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient’s vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing firmly.
If she finds it, she should maneuver it from the bladder’s opening downwards as much as possible until it reaches the base of the thigh, then make an incision at the midpoint of the vulva at the thigh’s root from whichever side she reaches and feels the stone.
Her finger should not leave the stone, pressing beneath it; make a small incision first, then insert a probe through the small incision, and if she feels the stone, enlarge the incision just enough for the stone to pass; know that there are many types of stones.
There are small and large stones, smooth and rough, long and round, and branched; know their types to inform your approach, and if blood overwhelms you, sprinkle powdered alum on the site and hold it for a while to stop the bleeding, then return to your work.
Continue until you remove the stone, and prepare in advance the tools mentioned for removing stones in men to assist in your work; if bleeding overwhelms you and you sense from the blood’s pulse that an artery is cut, apply the dust to the site.
Bind it tightly with a compress and leave it without returning, leaving the stone in place without removing it as the patient may otherwise perish; then treat the wound, and once the bleeding stops after a few days and the area festers, return to finish removing the stone.
Chapter sixty-two.
On incising the hydrocele.
A hydrocele is simply the accumulation of fluid in the white membrane beneath the scrotal skin surrounding the testicle, called the scrotum, and it may occur in a special membrane nature forms near one side of the testicle.
It may appear as if it is another testicle and may occur between the scrotal skin and the white membrane mentioned; this only happens rarely. This hydrocele originates from weakness affecting the testicles, attracting this substance, or it may arise from a blow to the testicles.
This fluid comes in various colors, either yellowish, bloody red, dark black, or watery white, the latter being most common, with identifying signs.
Where fluid accumulates, if it is in the white membrane mentioned, the swelling appears somewhat elongated, egg-shaped, and the testicle is not visible as it is surrounded by fluid on all sides.
If the fluid is in a special membrane of its own, the swelling appears rounded on one side of the testicle.
Thus, a person may think it is another testicle; if the fluid lies between the scrotal skin and the white membrane, it is palpable. To know the color of the fluid, probe the swelling with a square probe previously illustrated, and whatever appears on the probe’s tip will indicate its contents.
When ready for surgical treatment, order the patient to be bled if possible and his body appears full; then he should lie on his back on a slightly elevated surface, with plenty of cloths underneath, and you sit to his left.
Instruct an assistant to sit on his right and extend his penis to one side of the scrotal skin and towards the lower abdomen; then take a broad scalpel and make a vertical incision in the scrotal skin from the center to near the pubis.
Make the incision straight, parallel to the line dividing the scrotal skin in half until you reach the white containing membrane; peel it back carefully, avoiding cutting it, and let your dissection focus more on the area adherent to the testicle, peeling as thoroughly as possible.
Then you make a wide incision in the membrane filled with water and drain all the water; then you separate the lips of the incision with hooks, stretch the membrane upwards, avoiding the scrotal skin, and cut the membrane as thoroughly as possible, either entirely or piece by piece.
Especially the thin side, for if you do not cut it thoroughly, you cannot be sure that the water will not return. If the testicle emerges out of its skin during the procedure, then after finishing the membrane incision, return it and suture the edges of the scrotal skin together.
Then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals. If you find that the testicle has been damaged by another condition, you should tie off the vessels in the spermatic cord to prevent bleeding, then remove the testicle from the cord and take it out, treating the area as previously described.
If there is water accumulation on both sides, understand that there are two hydroceles; incise the other side as you did with the first. If it is possible to perform both procedures at once, do so, and then wipe away the blood.
Insert wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions, and then apply another piece of wool soaked in vinegar and oil externally. Spread it over the testicles and the area of the abdomen, and place a folded cloth on top as padding. Tie it from above with a bandage that has six ends, arranged in this manner:.
Then take two cloths, sew them, and stuff them with fluffed wool in this manner. Make the ties from cotton or moist wool, securing them tightly in the waistband of the trousers, with one end passing from the backside to the back.
The second tie goes toward the pubic area, two ends around the thighs from below, and the remaining two ends on the groin. Secure all the ties in the waistband of the trousers. This hydrocele can also be treated by cauterization instead of incision with metal.
This is done by taking a thin knife-like cautery and incising the scrotal skin with it while it is hot, as described, until the white membrane containing the water is exposed. Then take another cautery in this shape:.
It resembles the Greek eye, then use it to incise that membrane while it is hot until all the moisture is released. Then stretch the membrane with hooks and use the cautery to remove the containing layer, cutting as thoroughly as you can to remove it all while protecting the testicle from contact with the heat.
Know that this procedure is safer, minimizes bleeding, and is preferable to the incision method. If, during the incision or cauterization, you encounter a hot swelling, bleeding, or another issue, you should treat each of these problems with the appropriate treatment as previously described.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot endure this procedure due to its severity, then use the incision method that I will describe if you have confirmed the diagnosis based on the signs we previously mentioned.
If the hydrocele is watery, sit the patient on a high chair and incise the swelling at its base with a wide scalpel. Make the incision along the length of the body, and it should be wide enough for all the water to drain, then apply cotton to the site and bandage it.
Leave it to absorb the remaining water, and treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not drain during your incision, it may be because the white membrane obstructs the opening of the wound and prevents the water from coming out.
At this point, insert a goose feather or the instrument used to extract ascites fluid (as previously illustrated) into the wound, or slightly widen the wound opening.
Be aware that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so; if it does, make the incision again in the same manner, and the patient can manage the condition as it recurs over time.
Section Sixty-Three.
On Incision for the Fleshy Hydrocele and its Treatment.
Know that incising this type of hydrocele is dangerous and often leads to fatal outcomes; therefore, we recommend avoiding it to ensure safety. I will now describe the procedure and the types of swelling involved.
I say that many types of swellings may occur in the tissues that make up the testicles, due to various causes—either an acrid residue descending to the testicles, or a blow, and the swelling matches the body’s color without any fluid.
The swelling may be hard and sometimes petrified, with a dark color and no sensation. It may result from the entanglement and dilation of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from vein swelling. Arterial swelling can be identified by its dissipation when pressed.
If you press it with your fingers, it disperses and should not be interfered with. However, if the swelling is from venous dilation, it does not dissipate when pressed, and this type can be incised along with other tissues.
To do this, incise the scrotal skin, lift the testicle upwards, remove it from the white membrane, free the spermatic cord from the vessels, tie the vessels, and cut the cord after freeing it from each area around the testicle. If the testicle has adhered to those growing tissues.
The testicle must be extracted and excised. If the adhesion is between any of the membranes or between the vessels, all the attachments should be carefully freed and cut in a circular fashion.
If the tissue growth is located at the rear adhesion site, you must excise it entirely and remove the testicle as described. When your procedure is complete, pack the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and vinegar, and then treat it with other methods until it heals.
Chapter sixty-four.
On the treatment of hydrocele associated with a varicocele.
The varicocele is a twisted swelling, somewhat convoluted, resembling a cluster, with relaxation of the testicles, which makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient, and its treatment is risky, similar to what was previously mentioned.
However, it is necessary to describe the procedure as the predecessors practiced it, so I say that the patient should be seated on an elevated chair, and the testicular sac should be pressed downwards, then you grasp the skin of the scrotum with your fingers, along with the vessels that are close to the penis.
A servant other than yourself should hold it and stretch it forcefully, then you make an oblique incision with a broad, sharp scalpel along the vessels until they are exposed, then strip each side as I have described for drawing the arteries in the shoulders, then insert a needle with a doubled thread.
You tie it at the beginning of the places affected by the varicocele, and also tie it at the end, then make a vertical incision in the middle along the body and extract the accumulated cloudy, corrupted fluids.
Then treat the wound as with other wounds where you want the tissues to develop discharge, so that the vessels nourishing one of the testicles fall off, which is acceptable; but if the varicocele affects all the vessels, it may be necessary to remove one of the testicles with the vessels so that the other remains nourished. Otherwise, by cutting the vessels, they wither, rendering them useless.
Chapter sixty-five.
On the treatment of intestinal hydrocele.
This type of hydrocele occurs from a tear in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen around the groin area, where the intestine descends from this hernia into one of the testicles.
This hernia may result from either a tear or an extension of the peritoneum and can arise from various causes such as a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting something heavy, among other things. Its sign, if due to peritoneal extension, is that it occurs gradually over a long period.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling appears to deepen as the peritoneum compresses the intestine. If caused by a tear in the peritoneum, the sign is an intense pain that occurs suddenly, with the swelling visibly uneven and close beneath the skin.
This results from the intestine protruding outside the peritoneum, and sometimes the omentum may also protrude with the intestine, leading to what is called an intestinal and omental hydrocele, which may also contain gas; if feces pass into the intestine and are retained there, it can result in the patient's death.
This causes severe pain and rumbling, especially if compressed, and treating this condition with iron instruments is risky and should be approached with caution. The procedure involves instructing the patient to push the intestine back into the abdomen with his hand, if it can be returned.
Then he lies on his back before you, lifting his legs, while you stretch the skin near the groin upwards and make a longitudinal incision along the scrotum’s skin, then insert hooks into the edges of the incision as needed to keep it open.
The incision should be large enough to allow the testicle to emerge, then dissect the layers beneath the scrotal skin until the firm white peritoneum is fully exposed from all sides, and then insert your index finger next to the testicle.
Between the white membrane beneath the skin of the testicle and the second membrane, you release the adhesion behind the testicle, then bend it inward with the right hand toward the skin of the testicle, while with the left hand you pull the white membrane upward and lift the testicle with the membrane toward the incision.
You instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upward, and you completely release the adhesion behind it, examining with your finger to ensure there is no twisted intestine in the firm white membrane; if you find any, push it down into the abdomen.
Then, take a needle with a thick thread twisted from ten strands, insert it at the end of the membrane beneath the skin of the testicle near the incision, and cut the folded ends of the thread to make four threads. Then, arrange them in a crossed shape and tie the membrane beneath the skin of the testicle tightly from two sides, also twisting the ends of the threads and tying them firmly so that nothing from the vessels that nourish it can reach it. This prevents any hot swelling from occurring, and you make a second tie outside the first, about less than two fingers' width away; after these two ties, you leave a portion of the membrane beneath the skin of the testicle about the width of a finger.
This prevents any hot swelling from occurring, and you make a second tie outside the first, about less than two fingers' width away; after these two ties, you leave a portion of the membrane beneath the skin of the testicle about the width of a finger. Cut the remainder in a circular shape and remove the testicle with it, then make an incision at the lower part of the skin of the testicle so that blood and pus drain as we previously described, then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound and use the bandage as we explained.
The white membrane, as mentioned, may be cauterized after cutting it to prevent blood loss, as this often occurs; leave the bandage until it falls off naturally, and if it delays in falling, apply hot water and anything that induces sweating until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with general wound care until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
Regarding hydrocele due to wind: I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron, and the early doctors advised that it should be treated as we described for hydrocele with varix, whereby the vessels are gently tied after making an incision below.
Then, an incision is made in the middle, and the swelling is treated in a way that opens it so that the vessels fall away, and the wound is treated as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
On the hernia occurring in the groin.
A hernia may appear in the groin, as we mentioned, causing a bulge in the area without any intestine descending into the scrotum, and if any does descend, it is minor and returns at all times.
But if the condition persists, the split in the membrane increases until the intestine and omentum descend into the scrotum, which occurs due to the extension of the membrane in the groin, as we mentioned. This happens as the membrane extends, then slackens, causing the area to swell and bulge; its treatment is cauterization, as I previously described.
It may also be treated with iron in this manner: have the patient lie on his back before you, then make a transverse incision at the site of the swollen hernia, about three fingers wide, and separate the membranes under the skin.
Until the white membrane beneath it is exposed, then take a rod and place it on the bulging part of the membrane, pressing it into the depth of the abdomen, then sew the two protruding areas of the membrane at the end of the rod, joining them together with stitches.
Then, withdraw the end of the rod without cutting the membrane at all, nor touching the testicle or anything else, as I instructed in treating intestinal hydrocele, then treat it with wound care.
When the threads are removed, clean the wound and dress it until it heals, as the membrane contracts and the hernia bulge does not increase.
Cauterization is preferable in this location as it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-Eight.
On the relaxation of the skin of the testicle.
The skin of the testicle often becomes slack in some people without the underlying flesh relaxing, giving it an unsightly appearance, so whoever wishes to treat it should have the patient lie on his back.
Then, cut away all the slack skin down to the thick skin, bringing the edges together; if you wish, first sew the slack skin in three or four stitches to secure it, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the usual wound care until it heals and the stitches fall off.
Chapter Sixty-Nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our law.
For this reason, I should not mention it in this book; however, I do so for two reasons: first, so that the physician is informed if asked, and knows how to treat anyone affected by it, and second, because we often need to castrate certain animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, goats, cats, and other animals. I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting. In the crushing method, the procedure is to place the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then, crush them with your hand until they dissolve and cannot be felt by touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, the animal should be held, and the skin of its testicles compressed with the left hand, then tie off the cords and make a single incision on each testicle.
Then, when the testicles appear, cut them off after peeling them and leave nothing of the membranes on them except for the thin membrane over the vessels. This type of castration is better than that done by crushing.
Because crushing may leave a part of the testes, causing the animal to still desire intercourse; then, treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the treatment of hermaphrodites.
Hermaphroditism in men is of two types: in one type, an appearance resembling a woman’s vulva with hair appears next to the genital opening or on the scrotal skin between the testicles, and urine may flow from the part that is in the scrotal skin.
In women, there is one type, where a small, protruding structure resembling a man’s genitalia appears above the vulva on the pubic area; one part looks like a man’s penis, and the two others resemble testicles. The treatment for all three types is as follows.
For the two types in men and the single type in women, the excess flesh should be cut away until no trace remains, then treat the area like any other wound until it heals. As for the second type in men, where urine exits through the scrotal skin, no treatment is required, and it has no cure.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On the excision of the clitoris and excess flesh from the female genitalia.
The clitoris may grow beyond its natural size, becoming unsightly, and in some women, it may enlarge so much that it protrudes like a man’s organ and becomes engaged in intercourse.
You should grasp the excess part of the clitoris with your hand or a hook and cut it off without going too deep, especially at the base, to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then treat it with a wound-care regimen until it heals. The excess flesh is a growth that can fill the cervical opening.
It may even protrude externally, resembling a tail. For this reason, some early physicians call it the "tail disease"; it should be cut just as the clitoris is, and then treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On treating atresia (imperforate hymen or vaginal occlusion).
Atresia is when the woman’s genitalia are either unperforated or have a very small opening. This can be either congenital or acquired. The acquired form arises from a prior condition and may be due to an overgrowth of tissue.
It may also be from a thin or thick membrane, located in the uterine depth, sides, top, or bottom, preventing intercourse, conception, or childbirth, and sometimes menstruation. Diagnosis is made by visual examination by the midwife.
If the obstruction is close to the surface but not visible, she examines it with her fingers or a probe. If the blockage is a thin membrane close to the labia, proceed to puncture it by placing a small support on the labia and then pressing both thumbs.
With the woman lying on her back and her legs apart, pull the labia forcefully until the thin membrane tears and the blockage opens. Then take some wool soaked in oil and place it on the area, and have the woman engage in daily intercourse to prevent the site from healing over.
If the membrane is thick, incise it with a broad scalpel resembling a myrtle leaf. If the blockage is from an overgrown tissue, hook and cut it off, using non-caustic medicines to stop the bleeding, such as alum, dragon’s blood, and frankincense mixed with egg whites.
Then use a wide lead tube to prevent rapid closure, keeping it for several days, and use a dry linen wick. Then proceed with other wound treatments until it heals. Sometimes other growths appear in the uterus, and these should be cut in the same manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor; for a cancerous tumor in the uterus, surgery is never performed.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On treating hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that occur in female genitalia.
Hemorrhoids are swellings at the openings of blood vessels that cause persistent bleeding. If hemorrhoids persist, they become warts. Their types and signs were mentioned previously, and here we will discuss...
…those that respond to treatment and those that do not. I say that if hemorrhoids and warts are deep in the uterus and cannot be felt, they are not treated surgically. Only those at the uterine opening, which can be felt, are treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, and the warts should be stretched out with tweezers or a coarse cloth, then cut off at the base, with one of the non-caustic blood-staunching powders applied to stop the bleeding.
Examples include alum, dragon’s blood, frankincense, and similar substances. She should then raise her legs against the wall for a while and then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peel, gall nuts, and the like. Then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a poultice on her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise, apply cupping to the lower back and breasts without incision. Then, take a wool pad, soak it in the juice of restharrow, plantain juice, or blackberry branch juice with oak gall extract, and apply it to the area.
Once the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pustules, they resemble the heads of grain, with a rough appearance; cut off any that appear as with warts, and treat until it heals.
Chapter seventy-four.
On lancing an abscess that appears in the womb.
Many types of tumors may appear in the womb, such as cancer, indurated swelling, ulcers, abscess, gangrene, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and inflammatory tumors; I have described all these diseases, their types, and their symptoms in the classifications.
In this article, we should discuss the inflammatory swelling that appears in the womb when it is one of the tumors that accumulates pus and how to lance it with iron; you should examine it, and if the pain of the tumor at its onset is sharp with throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
And if you see it red and sensitive to touch, do not rush to lance it; treat it with what aids maturation until these symptoms subside, and then the woman should sit on a two-seated chair and lean back.
She should bring her legs toward her lower abdomen, her thighs spread apart, with her arms placed under her knees and bound together with an appropriate band.
Then the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument that opens the mouth of the womb, an illustration of which will follow; when you intend to use this instrument, you should measure the depth of the woman's womb with a probe so that the inserted part of the instrument does not exceed the depth of the womb.
If the instrument is deeper than necessary, padding should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the whole instrument from penetrating the womb's depth, and the screw in the instrument should be positioned at the upper side.
You should hold the instrument while an assistant turns the screw to open the cervix; if the abscess appears and feels soft and thin to the touch, it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel, and once all the pus is drained.
A soft wick soaked in rose oil or green oil with some astringent should then be placed in the wound, with the wick extending out of the incision in the cervix; then, clean wool soaked in water boiled with mallow should be placed over the womb and the pubic area.
Then, after two days, it should be treated with an appropriate ointment until healed.
The womb and the wound may be washed by injecting a mixture of water and honey, followed by water boiled with licorice root or long birthwort, and then resume with the ointment; if the abscess is hidden deep within the womb.
Treatment with iron should be avoided, and it should instead be treated with the methods mentioned in the classification.
Chapter seventy-five.
On teaching midwives how to treat live fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural position.
The midwife should first recognize the natural form of birth; signs include the woman bearing down, desiring fresh air, and feeling more at ease in her labor.
The fetus's rapid emergence indicates a natural birth, with its head emerging first, and the placenta either alongside or attached to its navel; upon seeing these signs, you should press on her abdomen to facilitate the quick expulsion of the fetus.
If it descends head-first, the placenta follows, and it is cleaned well of any residue; any birth deviating from this is unnatural and undesirable, as the fetus may emerge feet first or with hands preceding the head or legs.
One hand, one leg, or the head with one hand might emerge, or it could be curled up, sometimes turning on its back or presenting other problematic positions; thus, the midwife should be skillful and delicate with all these situations, cautious of error and mistake.
I will explain each of these positions and the appropriate procedures for dealing with them; if the fetus exits head-first as expected but the woman struggles with severe labor pains and her strength wanes, have her sit on a chair and instruct the women to support her.
Warm her womb with cooked fenugreek and moist oils, then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers to cut the placenta, or she tears it with her fingernail until its moisture flows, and she presses the woman’s belly until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, the woman should be injected with fenugreek saliva mixed with sesame oil, then instructed after the injection to push forcefully; she should be induced to sneeze with spikenard while holding her mouth and nose, and the fetus will come out immediately. If the fetus’s hands come out first, gently return them little by little.
If the hands cannot be repositioned inside, place the woman on a platform and raise her legs upward, then shake the platform on the ground while the woman holds on to prevent falling during the shake. If the hands do not retract and the fetus has died, cut them off and pull the remaining fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them gently until it comes out. If the fetus exits on its legs, you should push them upward, then gradually turn the fetus until it is straightened, and then take one of its legs and pull it slowly.
When the thighs emerge, instruct her to push forcefully and make her sneeze with spikenard, and the fetus will come out. If it does not come out as described, gradually reposition the fetus to its natural shape, then it will emerge smoothly. If it still resists after all these methods,
Take the saliva of marshmallow, fenugreek, sesame oil, and dissolved gum, pound all these well in a mortar, and apply it to the woman’s vulva and lower abdomen. Then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the ribs.
When you see that her lower body has softened, make her a fumigation of myrrh and let her hold it. After holding the fumigation for an hour, sit her on a chair, induce sneezing, and close her mouth and nose, then press gently on her lower abdomen, and the fetus will emerge immediately, coming out on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, carefully work to retract its hands little by little, then have the woman lie on her back, lower her legs downward as she lies on a bed, keep her hands clasped, and press gently on her upper abdomen. Then remove the cushions under her legs so that her lower body is positioned downward. If the fetus does not emerge, take both her legs and shake them vigorously, then press gently above her ribs until the fetus rises upward. Then the midwife should insert her hand and straighten the fetus little by little.
Instruct the woman to push forcefully until the fetus exits. If the fetus emerges transversely with one hand hanging out, work to reposition its hand; if this is not possible, make the woman stand and walk. If she cannot walk, have her lie down on
on her bed and shake her legs vigorously, then apply the mixture of salves described earlier. If labor begins, seat her on a chair, attempt to reposition the hand and align the fetus to its natural form, induce her to sneeze, and instruct her to push forcefully until the fetus emerges.
If the fetus emerges on its back with its hands extended and its face toward the mother’s back, the midwife should hold the fetus’s hand, then gradually turn it and align it gently. Once it is straightened, apply to her genitals the described oils and salves.
Then instruct her to move little by little. Once she does this, seat her on the chair, instruct her to lean to the right side, and then direct her to push forcefully and induce sneezing with spikenard; thus, the fetus will emerge, upright on its side.
If the fetus descends to the mouth of the womb with the placenta in this position, tear the placenta with your fingernail until the moisture is drained. If it clings to the fetus’s face and neck, cut it from the umbilical cord to prevent strangulation, then push the fetus inward until it is positioned correctly.
Instruct the woman to push forcefully several times, and it will exit smoothly. As for the birth of twins or multiple fetuses, know that twins are commonly born, and sometimes three or four are born and survive, although this is rare. As for five, it is unnatural and they do not survive at all.
They are surrounded by a single placenta, regardless of their number, and are separated by a membranous partition between them, each connected by its umbilical cord. They may emerge as a single fetus would, in a smooth natural birth, or with difficulty as described.
If some of them encounter difficulty during birth and assume unnatural positions as previously described, treat them as instructed. The midwife should be gentle, act with care and patience, and handle each form with whatever strategy will best ensure safety.
A note on the embryos that form in the womb and are miscarried: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even more than ten can form. I have verified that a woman once miscarried seven, and another miscarried fifteen, all fully formed.
By the will of the Almighty and All-Knowing, all this should be known by the midwife, for such cases might arise before her someday, and she should meet them with the appropriate response.
Chapter Seventy-Six.
On Extracting a Dead Fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus as described in the section on treatment and it has not been expelled, and the situation necessitates manual intervention, you should examine whether the woman is strong and free from symptoms that may threaten her life, in which case she should lie on her back on a bed.
Her head should be inclined downward, her legs elevated, with an assistant holding her on both sides or securing her to the bed so that her body does not move when the fetus is drawn out.
Then, the opening of her womb should be moistened with soft oils along with mallow saliva, fenugreek, and linseed. The midwife then applies these oils and saps to her hand, inserts it gently into the womb, and seeks a suitable spot on the fetus to hook with the instruments.
Observe: if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, insert the hooks into its eyes, nape, mouth, jaw, below its chin, its clavicle, or in areas close to the ribs or beneath the cartilage.
If the fetus is positioned feet-first, place the hooks in the pubic region and the middle ribs. Hold the hook in the right hand, with its curve positioned between the fingers of the left hand, then insert the hand gently and hook into one of the mentioned locations.
Continue until you reach a clear point, then place a second or third hook if needed, ensuring the traction is balanced without pulling to one side. Extend with steady traction, not merely in a straight direction, but gently moving to each side.
This aids in its release, similar to tooth extraction; between tractions, the grip should be relaxed. If any part is blocked, the midwife should lubricate her fingers and insert them to free the obstructed part. If part of the fetus emerges, the hooks should be repositioned slightly higher.
Continue this process until the entire fetus is expelled. If a hand emerges first and cannot be repositioned due to compression, wrap it with cloth and pull it out entirely, then sever it.
Either at the wrist joint or elbow, and proceed similarly for the other hand and feet. If the fetus’s head is large and obstructed or has accumulated fluid, a sharp-pointed scalpel should be inserted between the fingers.
Use it to incise the head, allowing the fluid to drain, or crush it with the instrument called the “mishdak,” whose illustration appears in the section on instruments following this.
The same should be done if the fetus has a naturally large head: the skull should be incised or crushed with the mishdak, as mentioned, and the bones extracted with hooks. If the head emerges and compresses at the clavicle, it should be incised to release chest fluids.
The chest will then compress. If the chest does not compress and cannot be expelled, it should be cut in the best possible manner. If the lower abdomen is swollen or has ascites, it should be incised to release the fluid.
If the fetus is positioned feet-first, pulling it out is easier, as is aligning it with the cervix. If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, wrap a cloth around your hand and draw it out, incising the abdomen or chest to release their contents.
If the limbs have been extracted and the head remains obstructed, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the cervix is open, her hand should enter the cervix to locate the head, drawing it with her fingers toward the cervix, then inserting one or two hooks to pull it out.
If the cervix has closed due to inflammation, force should not be applied. Instead, moist, fatty substances should be poured over, poultices applied, and the patient seated in relaxing, softening baths.
If the fetus is positioned sideways, it should be adjusted using the same procedure as with a live fetus; if this is not possible, it should be sectioned and extracted. No part of the placenta should remain inside at any cost. After the procedure, treat the uterus for any resulting inflammation as described.
If bleeding occurs, the woman should be immersed in astringent waters, along with other treatments. I once observed a woman who had become pregnant, but the fetus died in her womb; she then became pregnant again with it.
The second fetus also died, and after a long time, a swelling appeared at the site, inflamed until it opened, oozing pus. I was called to treat her and attended to her for a long period, but the wound did not close, so I applied some strong drawing ointments.
A bone emerged from the site; days later, another bone appeared. This surprised me, as the abdomen is not a location for bones. I inferred they were bones of the dead fetus, examined the wound, and extracted numerous bones from the fetus’s skull.
I continued extracting bones until I had removed many, while the woman remained in good health. She lived with a slight discharge from the site for a long time. I mention this unusual case here.
Because it provides knowledge and assistance for the physician who undertakes treatment by hand.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
The instruments required for the extraction of the fetus are depicted here.
A depiction of a screw used to open the mouth of the uterus.
This is the clamp used to align the books; it has screws at both ends of the wooden parts, but this screw should be more delicate than the clamp and should be made either of ebony or boxwood, with each piece being the thickness of two fingers.
The edges are about the width of a finger and the length is a span and a half; in the middle of the two pieces, there are two projections of the same wood, secured in place, each about half a span or slightly longer in length and about two fingers or slightly wider in breadth; these are the two projections.
These projections are inserted into the mouth of the uterus to open it by turning the screws; here is a depiction of another instrument for the same purpose, which is more delicate and lighter.
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two projections at the end, as you can see; each projection is about a span in length and two fingers in width, so if you want to open the uterus with it.
Seat the woman on a bed with her legs hanging down, spread apart between her thighs; then insert these two projections, joined, into the mouth of the uterus while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs, and then open your hand with the instrument as you would with hooks, to the extent you want to open the uterus. Until the midwife can do what she needs, here is a depiction of another screw as mentioned by the ancients.
A depiction of the instrument used to push out the fetus.
A depiction of the crushing tool used to crush the head of the fetus.
It resembles scissors with teeth at the end, as you see, and it can also be made rectangular like hooks in this design; as you see, it has teeth like a saw, used for cutting and crushing.
A depiction of another expelling instrument.
A depiction of a hook.
This hook is made slightly thick so it does not break when pulling the fetus with it; a depiction of a two-pronged hook.
A depiction of two broad scalpels for cutting the fetus.
The more types of these instruments there are and the more they are prepared by the craftsman, the faster his work and the higher his value among people; so do not underestimate having any instrument prepared, for you will certainly need it.
Chapter Seventy-Eight.
On the Extraction of the Placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, then induce sneezing with costus and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils; if it comes out this way, otherwise, take a pot.
Pierce a hole in the lid and place inside it herbs that open the mouth of the uterus, such as pennyroyal, rue, dill, chamomile, artemisia, cinnamon, and centaury—all of these herbs or some of them; submerge them in water and set it over the fire, then place a silver tube in the hole of the pot lid and the other end at the mouth of the uterus.
Hold it there until the steam reaches the depth of the uterus, then induce sneezing as we said, so the placenta will come out quickly; if it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow saliva.
Then insert it into the vagina to locate the placenta; once she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out gradually until it is expelled. If it is attached deep in the uterus, insert the hand as described, and once the placenta is found, pull it gently little by little with care.
To prevent the uterus from prolapsing due to strong pulling, it should instead be gently moved to the sides, right and left, and then increase the pull; it will then respond and release from attachment. If the mouth of the uterus is closed, we have described the treatment by sneezing, the pot treatment, and the herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, do not use force in pulling again; instead, tie what has emerged from the uterus to the woman's thigh, then inject her with the fourfold ointment, as it will decay after a few days.
It will disintegrate and come out; however, if it decays, it will emit a foul smell that rises to the stomach and head, harming the patient, so suitable fumigations should be used.
For this, some of the ancients have tried the smoke of watercress and dried figs; here is a depiction of the instrument used to fumigate the woman when menstruation or placenta is retained and similar issues.
It is made of lead resembling a funnel or of copper; the narrow end is placed in the vagina, and the wide end is placed over the fire with incense placed on embers. You hold it until the incense is used up, and then replace it with more.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
On Treating an Imperforate Anus.
Many infants are born with imperforate anuses, blocked by a thin membrane; the midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger, or, if not, cut it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil over it and treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear it will close up, place a lead tube in the opening for many days, removing it whenever the child wants to defecate.
Obstruction of the anus may also occur from a wound healing over or a tumor; in such cases, that adhesion should be cut open, then treated with the aforementioned treatment and lead tube.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
The fistulas that occur in the lower part are complications and swellings that appear near the anus externally or in the surrounding area on one side, and the fistula may be singular or multiple.
If this complication persists, it will open, and watery white fluid or thin pus will discharge from it; some of these fistulas may penetrate into the rectum and intestines, while others do not. The penetrated fistula can be recognized by the discharge of stool or gas when the patient defecates.
Sometimes worms may exit from it; some fistulas, if they are in the area, may penetrate the bladder and the urethra, or may penetrate the hip joint or sacrum. The distinction between a fistula that penetrates the anus and one that does not can also be known.
You insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the fistula, either copper or iron if the fistula has no twists. If it has twists, insert a thin lead probe or a strand of horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or the strand in your finger. If you do not feel it at all, and nothing exits the hole—no stool, gas, or worms, as we mentioned—then know it is non-penetrated, so proceed with treatment.
If the fistula penetrates to the bladder or urinary tract, it is indicated by urine exiting from it and the area not healing with medicines. If it penetrates to the hip joint or sacrum, it is indicated by the probe reaching that area.
If there is no twist in it towards the bone, pain is felt around the area, pus continually exits, and no treatment or ointment heals it; these penetrated fistulas are all incurable.
Treating them is futile trouble for those unlearned physicians who attempt it. However, as for those that are non-penetrated and non-chronic, recovery is hoped for with the use of the iron, as I will describe and as I have experienced. Lay the patient on his back before you.
Raise his legs upward, with his thighs tilted toward his abdomen, then insert a copper or lead probe into the fistula if there are twists, so that you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe in your finger, having penetrated on its own, exposed without any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrated. Do not trouble yourself with it, for as we said, it is incurable.
It is said that in rare cases it may heal in some people. One treatment hoped to be beneficial is to heat a thin cautery iron according to the width of the fistula, as mentioned before, and insert it while hot into the fistula until it reaches near the anus, then repeat it two or three times.
Until you know that all of the excess tissues have burned up—the ones that resemble the tube of a bird’s feather—then treat it with twisted threads soaked in ghee until the burnt tissues come out, and then treat it with healing ointments. If it heals, so be it.
Otherwise, it will never heal by any other treatment. However, if you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger in the anus, and there is a thick barrier of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the fistula near the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula. Make the incision along with the probe while it is in the fistula, until the incision reaches the end of the probe; then remove the probe, and it will fall away. Then clean out all those clogged tissues that resemble the tube of a bird’s feather, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If bleeding overwhelms you and interferes with your work in cutting out those tissues, the best and quickest remedy is to cauterize with fire or a sharp medicine, for cauterization by fire serves two good purposes: burning away excess tissues.
Stopping the blood and drying the moisture. Then treat it with twisted threads soaked in ghee or sulfur powder mixed with oil until the site produces pus, expelling the burnt tissues in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that promote the growth of solid flesh.
These are medicines that contain astringents and drying agents; if it heals, then it is cured, and recurrence is not expected. If the fistula has reached deep into the anus and is far from the body's surface, insert your finger into the anus and examine it.
If you feel the probe, with a barrier of membrane or flesh between you and it, and it is close to penetration, then the work in it is only one of hopeful expectation, using one of three methods: either cauterize it as we have said.
Or make an incision until you reach its depth, allowing you to insert twisted threads and administer treatment nearby, but do not extend the incision too far so as not to cut the muscle surrounding the anus, which would cause the patient involuntary stool passage. Then treat it as mentioned; it may possibly heal, as we said.
Or you may penetrate that barrier and pierce it after making an incision close to the anus, as we mentioned, using either the probe or another sharp-edged instrument. Then thoroughly clean out all the clogged tissues within the incision as far as you can manage.
Then heal the entire wound along with the fissure and the upper opening until it closes, while leaving the fistula open inside the rectum so that it is easier on the patient; the fistula may be perforated in this manner.
This is when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is on one side of the rectum near the surface of the body with the skin and around the rectum; then take a probe with a perforated end like a shoemaker's needle, in this form:.
Insert into it a twisted thread of five strands or so, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches the bottom; if it is perforated near the edge of the rectum from the inside.
Pull the thread out through that hole by inserting your finger into the rectum and pulling out the end of the thread, then bring both ends together and tighten them; leave it for a day or two, and each time the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it well until the tissues between the ends of the threads are severed and fall off. Then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the mouth of the fistula is not perforated, perforate it in whatever way you can, unless it is very deep, in which case you must not do it to avoid cutting the muscle. Then proceed with it as we mentioned until it heals.
The form of the thorn-like scalpel used to incise fistulas has one very sharp edge, while the other side is not sharp, to avoid cutting what is unnecessary, as you see:.
Chapter Eighty-One.
On perforating hemorrhoids that bleed, cutting them, and treating fissures.
Hemorrhoids come in two types: either they are inside the rectum, resembling red bulbs or like clusters of grapes, and they vary in size, with blood constantly flowing from them.
They may be single or multiple, and they may be outside the rectum or around its edges. However, those outside the rectum are usually less moist, with yellowish fluid or a small amount of blood constantly seeping, and they are of the same color as the body.
The treatment for those inside the rectum is to instruct the patient to defecate and strain until the rectum protrudes, and the warts become visible to you. Then, quickly catch them with hooks or hold them with your nail and cut them at their roots. If the hooks do not hold due to their moisture and looseness.
Wipe them with a rough cloth or with a piece of Marazz bread, or pull them with your fingers and then cut them. After cutting, sprinkle some sharp powders on them to act as cauterization, or cauterize them as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with other treatments until they heal. If the rectum does not respond to protrusion, administer an enema with a slight sting to wash out the rectum, allowing it to emerge quickly when the patient strains. As for the warts outside the rectum, they are easily managed.
This involves taking hold of them with your nail or catching them with a hook and cutting them, then treating them as we have described until they heal. For those who dislike cutting with metal, perforation is done as follows: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upward and pass the needle through its base from the other side. Wrap the ends of the thread under the needle while it is perpendicular, tighten the wart firmly, tie the thread, and remove the needle. Do this to all the warts, leaving one unperforated.
To allow for residual blood drainage, place a cloth soaked in rose oil or carrot oil on the rectum, instruct the patient to remain still, and leave it until the warts fall off. Once they have fallen, treat the area with ointments and other treatments until it heals.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often result from dry stool and constipation. If they become chronic and do not respond to medication, they should be scraped with a scalpel blade or your nail until they become moist, removing the outer crust that prevents healing.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, scrape it again, more thoroughly than before, until it bleeds lightly and is abraded. Then treat it, and it will heal.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
On treating inverted and non-inverted calluses, dry warts, and anthills.
A callus is a round lump the color of the skin, resembling a nail head, and it can appear anywhere on the body, especially on the soles of the feet and toes, often causing pain when walking.
You should cut around the callus, grasp it with forceps or a hook, and remove it from its root, then treat it. If you wish, you can cauterize it as described previously. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, and rounded protrusion above the surface of the skin.
They frequently appear on children's hands, and the treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it or perforate it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off. If you wish, you may cauterize it as previously described with fire or sharp medicine.
Inverted and non-inverted warts can also be removed with the tool I will describe for treating anthills. As for the anthill, it is also a small, thick, and compact protrusion on the skin surface that extends deeply inward. When exposed to cold, it feels similar to an ant sting.
It can occur anywhere on the body, most commonly on the hands. Its treatment involves taking a tube made from a goose feather or a strong eagle feather, placing the tube over the anthill so its circle surrounds it, and then twisting your hand with the tube to cut around the anthill.
The tube cuts deep into the flesh, allowing the anthill to be extracted from its root. If you prefer, you can use a copper or iron tube designed like this:.
The top of the tube is firm and twisted for easy gripping and twisting with the fingers. If you wish, you can cauterize the anthill as described previously for warts in the chapter on cauterization.

On the types of instruments used for enemas in treating rectal ailments, diarrhea, and colic.
The enema syringe can be made of silver, porcelain, or forged copper. These instruments are made in various sizes, small or large, depending on the users. The syringes used for treating young children are small, and for those with narrow or sore rectums, the syringes are made very delicate. Illustration of a large syringe:.
The upper funnel, where the bladder is attached, is wide and has a barrier where the bladder is tied, as seen. The lower end, which is inserted into the rectum, is very smooth and firm, with two holes on one side and one on the other.
The holes are as wide as the thickness of the piston or slightly wider. The bladder, used to hold the medication, is made from an animal bladder or sheep skin and shaped like a small pouch with a diameter of one span.
It is perforated with many holes spaced about the width of a finger apart. Then, a strong thread spun from ten strands or so is passed through the holes to secure the bladder like a pouch. After filling it with medication, the top of the syringe is tightly fastened between two stones, and then it is used to administer the enema. Here is the image of the bladder's circle and perforations:.
To use it, fill the skin or bladder with medication, warmed to a temperature tolerable to the patient. Be careful not to make it too hot or too cold. The patient lies on their back, raising their legs upward.
A mat or cloth is placed beneath the patient, and the tip of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek mucilage, or the like. Then it is gently inserted into the rectum, and the assistant holding the bladder presses it firmly until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the intestines.
The syringe is then removed, and the patient lifts their legs against a wall. If the medicine urges evacuation, the patient should hold it in as long as possible. Keeping it in overnight is most beneficial. If used to treat diarrhea and its evacuation is immediate, the enema should be repeated until recovery.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings in the rectum, the syringe should be particularly delicate and smoother than those used for children. This is an illustration of a delicate syringe with a leather covering:.

On the treatment of wounds.
I have mentioned in the classification of treatments those that resemble cauterizations, and here I will detail their treatment manually and with complete medication. Wounds differ depending on the object causing the injury and the location of the wound.
The objects causing wounds are numerous, such as a stone strike, a sword slash, a knife cut, a spear stab, a stick blow, an arrow, and many other similar things.
As for wounds based on the body's location, they include injuries to the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and similar organs.
I will describe the treatment of some wounds so they can serve as a model and rule for other wounds. I will start with simple head injuries specifically, as compound injuries will be discussed at the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
I say that when a simple head wound occurs without a bone fracture, examine it. If it is caused by a stone strike or similar and has only torn the skin, and the wound is large, and you fear the onset of hot swelling, promptly perform venesection at the cephalic vein accordingly. Do not delay; extract blood proportionate to the patient's strength unless there is a contraindication to venesection. This is especially important if the blood flowing from the wound is minimal. The venesection should be done on the side opposite the wounded area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinking, and thick foods. If something prevents bloodletting, reduce food intake and avoid meat and beverages. Apply to the wound, if it develops a hot swelling, a cotton swab soaked in rose oil alone or mixed with an astringent beverage.
If the hot swelling is avoided, apply to the wound, if it is fresh with blood and not altered by air, the powder I will describe shortly. But if the air has altered it, apply some ointments.
Let it produce pus, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large, caused by a sword or similar, and its edges do not join with bandages, sew it as I will describe for stitching abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is barely attached by a small ligament, cut it, then treat the wound with medicines that regenerate firm flesh instead of skin. Instruct the patient to consume nourishing foods like heads and porridge.
If the skin develops rot and is not attached to the bone, remove all the rotten parts and discard them, then treat it. If a wound involves an artery or vein bleeding uncontrollably and medication does not stop the blood, locate the artery.
If you find the artery and it does not stop, sever it with a scalpel and tie it. If necessary, if previous measures fail, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If the wounds are small and simple, treat them easily by sprinkling the described powder while they are fresh with blood.
Before the air alters it, prepare the powder as follows: take one part frankincense, two parts absinthe, and three parts lime (slaked or unslaked). Grind and sift them, pack the wound with it, and bind it firmly so it adheres well.
It will coagulate with the blood. Then bind it with bandages and leave it as long as it does not swell, for the medication will not detach until it heals. Lime alone can be used if frankincense and absinthe are unavailable.
This method can also be used in many large wounds if applied correctly and bound tightly, provided the wounds are fresh with blood and not altered by air. However, if the air has caused some changes, especially during summer.
Using this powder is ineffective. Instead, treat it with ripening ointments or a poultice of barley flour mixed with water and honey until pus forms, then continue treatment until it heals.
If the wound involves a minor bone fracture, use forceps to align it. I will mention the treatment of skull fractures later. For a wound in the neck, the treatment does not differ from that of a simple head wound.
If a nerve or artery in the neck is severed, for a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treatments with strong astringents like verdigris and vitriol, as they harm and irritate the nerve.
Never apply anything cold to the wound because the essence of the nerve is cold, and it connects to the brain, the noblest organ. Use soft treatments like lime washed several times in fresh water and soaked in oil, rose oil, or zinc oxide.
Also wash with fresh water and use other mineral stones similarly, along with moist ointments. If the wound is large, use stitching or approximate its edges with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound is deep and forms a cavity at its bottom where pus collects, incise it at its lowest point. If an artery is severed and bleeding is detected, cut it, tie it, or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has severed some or all of the tracheal rings but spared the carotid arteries, stitch the edges of the skin to the tracheal tube without touching it. Align and restore its natural shape, then bind it securely and leave it for a few days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound affects the bone, inspect it. Remove any bone fragments entirely or as much as possible. If some cannot be removed, leave them until the wound festers, heals, and facilitates removal.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powder we described; if it festers in the wound and the bone becomes infected and forms a fistula, treat it as will be mentioned in its chapter, in surgeries of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a stab wound from a spear or knife and you see it is deep, observe if air escapes from it when the patient breathes, then know it is a fatal wound. If it is not deep and is fresh with blood, do not apply powder to it immediately nor bind it, lest the blood becomes trapped in its depth.
It may flow back to the heart and kill the patient; instead, apply an absorbent ointment and replace it twice daily. If you do not have an ointment, place an old piece of cotton in the wound to absorb what flows from it, and position the patient to sleep on the side of the wound.
This allows what gathers there to flow out. If three days or more have passed since the wound occurred and the patient shows no spasms, bad palpitations, or difficulty breathing, and you see their overall condition is good, then know the wound is sound and treat it with dressing and other remedies until it heals.
If healing becomes difficult and there is persistent discharge, then know it has turned into a fistula and treat it as described in its chapter. Position the patient on the wound so what gathers in it can drain. If the wound is in the chest or back, treat it as previously described for stitching.
If it is large, use sutures; if small, use powder. If the wound affects the bone and fragments are broken off, inspect the wound and promptly remove those fragments if they are detached; if they are not detached, leave them until...
...the wound festers, as this makes their removal easier. As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment follows the same principles we have mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-Five.
On Abdominal Wounds, Protrusion of the Intestines, and Their Suturing.
An abdominal wound may be large, small, or moderate. A large wound may cause one or several intestines to protrude, making their reinsertion and suturing more severe and difficult.
A small wound may also be difficult in another way, as reintroducing the intestines becomes harder. If the intestine is not promptly returned to its place, it swells and thickens, making its reinsertion difficult. For this reason, a moderate-sized wound is preferred, as it does not present the same challenges as these two types.
Know that suturing the abdomen is done in four ways: two general methods suitable for suturing the abdomen and other body wounds, and two specific methods applicable to all wounds but particularly suited for suturing the abdomen.
I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and detail. I say that if the wound is small and some intestine protrudes and is difficult to return, this is for one of two reasons: either the small size of the wound, as we mentioned, or because the intestine swelled due to exposure to cold air.
If this is the case, you should warm it by soaking a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water, or water boiled with citronella, cyperus, and spikenard, and then apply it to the intestine until the swelling subsides.
A decoction with astringent properties may also be used, as it is better than water alone in reducing the swelling. Once the swelling subsides, moisten the intestine with water boiled with mallow or marshmallow; this facilitates its reinsertion with minimal effort.
If reinsertion remains difficult after this treatment, enlarge the wound slightly with the instrument used for incising fistulas. The first method, if feasible, is preferable to incision, which should only be done as a last resort when all other measures fail. This is the form of the instrument:
One end of the instrument is curved and sharp, while the other is blunt. The sharp end is not as thin as a scalpel but slightly flattened. It resembles a small mace, as you see. Once the wound is widened and the intestine reinserted, ensure it is returned to its natural shape.
Restore it to its specific location, if possible, as this is preferable. If the wound is wide and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs elevated above their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, elevate their head and chest above their lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always position the wounded side higher than the other. This principle should be applied in major and moderate surgeries.
As for minor surgeries, position the patient as circumstances permit. Then bring a skilled assistant to hold the entire wound with both hands, bringing its edges together and revealing portions to the suture operator bit by bit.
This is the method for one of the general sutures: take a needle or several needles, depending on the wound’s size. Leave a margin of tissue equal to the thickness of a pinky finger and insert a single needle without thread through the edges of the skin. Pass it through the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin until it exits the opposite side. This brings together the margins of both the skin and the peritoneum, creating four layers. Then, tie a doubled thread securely around the needle multiple times from both sides until the wound edges are tightly closed.
Then leave a space about the thickness of a finger and insert another needle, fastening it with thread as you did with the first needle. Continue this process with as many needles as needed until the entire wound is sutured. The needles should be of medium thickness.
Needles that are too thin cut through the flesh quickly, while thicker ones are difficult to insert into the skin, so they should be of moderate thickness. The needle should not be inserted too close to the edge of the skin.
This prevents the flesh from tearing quickly and the wound from opening before it heals. Likewise, do not suture too far apart to avoid inhibiting wound closure. Then cut the ends of the needles so they don’t harm the patient during sleep, and place linen cloth pads on both sides to hold the needle ends.
Leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of suturing with needles is more suitable for smaller wounds, as it may be sufficient to use only one or two needles, or something similar.
The second general suturing technique involves stitching all four edges—both skin edges and both peritoneum edges—in one pass with a needle threaded with moderately thick, twisted thread. After passing the needle through these four layers, return the needle to the side where you initially started.
This way, the thread will form a crisscross pattern across the top of the wound, resembling the way sacks are sewn to secure contents. Leave a space between each stitch about the thickness of a pinky finger; this type of suture is well-known to everyone.
Using this method, I once sutured a man’s abdominal wound caused by a knife. The wound was wider than a span, and about two spans of the middle intestine had protruded from the wound in the center of his abdomen.
I returned his intestines after they had been exposed for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he fully recovered. He lived for many years afterward, able to engage in all his affairs, though doctors had initially declared he would never recover.
Remarkably, I did not use any ointment, as I was in a place with no medicines available. Instead, I applied old cotton to the wound twice a day and regularly cleansed it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two specific types of suturing, I will describe it according to Galen's precise instructions. Start the suture from the skin, inserting the needle from the outside to the inside. Once the needle passes through the skin and the muscle that runs straight along the length of the abdomen,
leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle, then pass the needle from inside to outside through the other edge on the opposite side. Once you have done this, pass it again through the same edge on the opposite side from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, making sure the needle also passes through the edge of the abdominal muscles on its side until it goes through all layers.
Then, begin again from this side, stitching it together with the edge of the peritoneum on the opposite side. Pull the needle out through the skin nearby, then return it through that skin and suture the edge of the peritoneum on the other side with the edge of the abdominal muscle.
Pull it out through the skin on that side, then repeat the process, doing it stitch by stitch until the entire wound is sutured in this manner. This technique resembles the way furriers stitch furs together.
Stitch the peritoneum once on one side with the edge of the skin, then leave it on the other side, and continue until you finish. As for the second specific suturing technique mentioned by Galen, here is his exact statement:
“This method involves stitching it in the manner of certain healers, where each part is brought together with its natural counterpart, joining the edge of one section of peritoneum with its other edge and the edge of the abdominal muscles with its opposite edge. This is done as I will describe for you.”
Insert the needle into the outer edge of the nearby abdominal muscle and pass it inside through that layer alone, leaving the edges of the peritoneum untouched. Then return the needle and pass it from outside to inside through both edges of the peritoneum, repeating the process.
You pass it from the inside to the outside through the edge of the other side of the abdominal lining opposite to it, and this type of stitching is better than the simple common stitching that was previously mentioned. This is the literal statement of Galen, and some have said that the stitching of the abdomen can be done with two needles. This involves threading one thread through them, starting by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side, then inserting the other needle from the opposite side and passing it from your side, similar to the stitching of cobblers.
Know that if the tear is in the middle of the abdomen, stitching it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen. As for treating the wound, its treatment is similar to other wounds: if you find the wound fresh with its blood before air alters it, and you return the intestines and stitch and secure them, then apply to it the healing powder.
If the wound has been altered by air, apply some ointments you have available until it festers, the threads fall off, and the peritoneum and abdominal linings heal, then treat it like other wounds until it recovers.
If no medicines are available, apply worn cotton to it as soon as it begins to fester, replacing it twice a day as I have instructed, until it heals. You will not need additional treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple unless you fear the wound will involve major organs in the pain.
In such cases, you should soak soft wool in moderately heated oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpit. If the patient feels pain or infection in their intestines, which often occurs, administer a lukewarm black astringent drink as an enema.
Especially if the infection has reached the intestines and turned into a penetrating wound into the abdomen. Know that the thicker parts of the intestines are easier to heal, while the thinner parts are more difficult to heal.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not heal from any injury due to the abundance and size of its veins, the thinness of its structure, and its proximity to the nature of nerves. However, if the protrusion from the wound is the omentum and it is found fresh, return it as you would return the intestines.
If it has been a while and it has turned green or black, it should be tied with a thread above the blackened area to prevent bleeding, as the omentum contains veins and arteries, then cut below the ligature.
Leave the ends of the thread hanging outside the bottom of the wound to make it easier to pull out when the omentum falls off and the wound festers. Regarding wounds in the intestines, if a tear occurs and it is small.
It may heal in some people, for I once saw a man who had a stab wound in his abdomen from a spear. The wound was to the right of the stomach, and it became chronic, turning into a fistula from which feces and wind emerged. I continued to treat him, though I did not hope for his recovery. I persisted in gentle treatment until he healed and the site closed. When I saw that the wound had healed, I feared for the patient that something bad might occur in his abdomen, but nothing adverse happened at all, and he remained in excellent condition. He was healthy, eating, drinking, engaging in intercourse, visiting the bath, and exercising in his work. Some experienced practitioners have mentioned that when a small wound occurs in the intestines, it should be stitched in this manner.
Large-headed ants are taken, and the edges of the wound are brought together. Then one ant, with its mouth open, is placed on the edges of the wound. When it bites and tightens its grip, its head is cut off, as it adheres and does not loosen. Another ant is then placed close to the first.
This is repeated with several ants, according to the size of the wound. Then the wound is closed, and the edges stitched. These heads remain adhered to the intestines until they heal and recover, without causing any harm to the patient. The intestines can also be stitched with fine thread.
This thread is extracted from the animal's intestines and used after being threaded through a needle. A section of the intestine thread is finely extracted and tied to a thin twisted linen thread, which is then inserted into the needle. The intestinal thread is used to stitch the intestines, which are then returned to the abdomen. This method of stitching with ants and intestinal thread is used out of hope and expectation.
However, if the tear is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy, nor can it heal at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On the treatment of catarrh and fistula.
Know that any wound or swelling that persists for a long time, becomes an ulcer, does not heal, and continuously discharges pus without ceasing, is generally referred to as a fistula in any organ where it occurs, and we call it catarrh, and the fistula.
It is, in reality, a hardened, compact, white mass without pain, having a cavity resembling the hollow of a bird’s feather.
For this reason, some have called it a feather. At times, it is moist and continuously discharges pus, though the moisture may occasionally cease. This moisture can be abundant or scanty, thick or thin.
I have previously mentioned in the classification, during my discussion of wounds, that any ulcer that does not heal or does not grow flesh is due to one of nine reasons: either a lack of blood in the body, its poor quality, or the presence of hardened flesh within it or on its edges preventing the growth of healthy flesh. Or because it is excessively soiled and filthy, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the substance nourishing it is of poor quality, or because the medicine used is unsuitable for its treatment, or due to a corruption occurring in the town, like a plague, or a specific condition within the town.
Or because it is excessively soiled and filthy, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the substance nourishing it is of poor quality, or because the medicine used is unsuitable for its treatment, or due to a corruption occurring in the town, like a plague, or a specific condition within the town. As occurred in the city of Zaragoza, where diseases are difficult to mature and swellings heal slowly by nature. Or because there is one or several bones in it. I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the classification.
Here, I must acquaint you with the treatment of fistula and catarrh by manual operation. Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body. Some fistulas extend to large vessels, arteries, or nerves.
Or to membranes, intestines, the bladder, a rib, a vertebra of the spine, or a joint of the complexly assembled joints, like the hand or foot. Some lead to the vicinity of a major organ or similar areas.
Any fistulas of this nature are among the difficult-to-cure diseases that do not respond to treatment, and engaging with them is futile and ignorant. However, if a fistula has not reached the mentioned locations, and you hope and aspire to treat it.
And if you wish to ascertain this, take a probe of copper or iron. If the fistula runs straight, examine it with this probe. If the fistula is crooked, inspect it with a fine lead probe, as lead is pliable.
It moves smoothly upon entry and bends toward the curvature. If the fistula has multiple openings and you cannot identify them with the probe, inject one of its openings with liquid, for the moisture you inject will flow toward the other openings and discharge from them.
Then thoroughly examine in any possible way to determine whether there is bone or nerve involved, whether the depth of the fistula is far or near, whether it is a single fistula with multiple openings. Investigate all this as much as you can by questioning the patient and noting the presence of pain when you press your hand on the site.
And similar indications and causes of swelling. Once you have accurately determined all this, then proceed confidently to the treatment, considering whether it is such that.
The fistula is visible, close, or located in a healthy site far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the locations I have mentioned. In such cases, incise the fistula as per my earlier description and extract the hardened masses, decayed flesh, and excess tissue from within it.
And anything growing at its opening, such as flesh or warts, and the like, treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep and straight, you should incise it as deeply as possible and clean it of all its decayed flesh.
Then use medicated twisted wicks dipped in caustic medicines and insert them into the depth of the fistula as far as the iron probe reaches. Repeat this process until the caustic medicine consumes all the remaining decay at the bottom of the fistula.
Then dress it with ointments that promote the growth of healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal, cauterize it as described earlier. If the cause of the fistula is bone, and you confirm this, examine and incise it as I have explained, unless you are prevented by an obstacle such as.
A vein, nerve, or major organ, as we have said. If the bone is exposed to you and it shows signs of decay or blackness, scrape it until its decay is removed, then treat it with substances that promote its healing until it recovers. If it does not heal and continues to discharge pus as before.
Know that if you have not completely removed all the decay, uncover it all again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it to the best of your ability, then dress it. If it heals, well and good; otherwise, know that the decay lies deep within. Uncover it all again.
Scrape and cleanse it as thoroughly as possible. If the decayed bone is a small one and you can extract it, pull it out using delicate hooks suitable for this purpose.
If there are multiple bones, carefully extract them all and leave nothing behind, to the best of your ability. If any ligaments obstruct them and cutting them poses no danger, cut these ligaments and any flesh present, and free the bones.
If you cannot extract the bones immediately, apply to the wound something that will induce decay, and leave it for a few days until the flesh and ligaments around the bones decay. Ensure the wound does not heal over the incision you made during the process.
Rather, place over it, if you fear this, cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in the Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. These will decay the ligaments and loosen the bones, making their extraction and removal easier.
If it is a single large bone, such as the tibia or femur, and only its surface is decayed, scrape it thoroughly until the blackness and decay are removed, then dress the wound. However, if a large portion is decayed and the decay has reached the marrow, it must be sawn.
Cut it completely until the decay ends, then treat it until it heals. I will tell you of a fistula that occurred in a man’s leg, which you may use as an example and aid in your practice. This man was young in age.
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to an internal condition. The matter accumulated in the leg, causing a significant swelling without any external cause. Over time, with errors by the physicians, the swelling ruptured.
Much matter discharged from it, and it was poorly treated until the leg developed multiple fistulae, all discharging pus and bodily fluids. Several physicians treated him over two years, but none of them were skilled in manual surgery.
Eventually, he came to me. I observed his leg, with a profuse discharge of matter from the fistulae. The man had grown emaciated, and his complexion had turned yellow. I inserted a probe into one of the fistulae, which led to the bone, and then examined all the openings.
I found that they interconnected from all sides of the leg. I promptly incised one of the openings, exposing part of the bone. I discovered it was decayed, eroded, blackened, rotten, and perforated, with the perforations extending to the marrow. I sawed away the portion that was revealed to me.
I removed the decayed bone, believing there was no further decay beyond what I had cut and removed. I then attempted to heal the wound with adhesive medications for an extended period, but it did not heal. I returned to examine the bone again, above the initial area I had uncovered.
I found the decay connected to the bone, so I sawed away the portion of decay visible to me. Again, I attempted to heal the wound, but it did not mend or close. I examined it once more and continued cutting the bone, piece by piece, attempting to heal it, but it did not heal until I had removed approximately a span of bone.
I removed the bone along with its marrow, then treated the wound with medications, and it healed quickly. This repeated process of surgery and cutting was necessary due to the patient’s weakness, his limited endurance, and my fear for his life, as he frequently experienced fainting fits from excessive drainage. Nevertheless, he achieved complete recovery.
Firm flesh grew in the place of the removed bone, his overall condition improved, his strength returned, and he resumed his normal activities without any hindrance in walking or any harm whatsoever. If a bone protrudes in a part of the body and has fractured.
It should be sawed in the following manner: Take a bandage and tie it to the protruding end of the bone. Instruct someone to pull it upward. Then place another, thicker woolen bandage beneath the first one.
Tie this bandage around the flesh beneath the bone, and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downward. Meanwhile, expose the flesh from the area where you intend to saw, to avoid harming it with the saw. Place a sturdy piece of wood or a plank beneath the bone to stabilize it from below.
For if you do so, the saw will not fail to cut through the diseased bone, and the cutting should be just above the site of corruption slightly, so that there may not be corruption within the cavity of the bone that is not apparent on the surface to the senses, thus compelling you to cut it again.
If the bone is diseased but not protruding, and the parts are connected, with the corruption in its middle or part of it, expose the flesh from all sides entirely, then place the wooden block underneath and cut from the first side where the corruption is.
When you have finished cutting it, then cut it from the other side, ensuring that the cutting is slightly away from the corruption, as we have said. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the diseased joint itself and saw the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no solution except scraping. If the corruption is in the metacarpal of the hand or the metatarsal of the foot, the treatment is very difficult, but you should peel away the corruption however it appears to you, scrape it, and clean it in any way you can.
By any method that works for you, provided no vein or nerve obstructs you. Know that the cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones are numerous, varying according to the placement of the bones, their alignment, thickness, thinness, size, and firmness or fragility. Therefore, you must prepare for each type of operation a tool appropriate to that operation.
Know that the procedures themselves may guide you to the type of tool you need if you possess long experience and knowledge in the arts of this craft, for whoever masters the craft and observes various types of diseases. He may devise for himself tools suited to each disease. I will illustrate for you, at the end of this chapter, several tools.
These will serve as examples to follow and as a measure to compare with others, God willing. Image of a saw:.

Chapter Eighty-Seven.
On amputations and bone cutting.
Limbs may become gangrenous either due to an external cause or an internal one. If you treat the corruption with medications and the treatment does not succeed, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb without being stopped by anything.
Then you must amputate that limb to the extent of the corruption, so that the patient may escape death or a severe affliction worse than the loss of the limb. The sign of this condition is that the limb blackens to the extent that you would think fire has burned it.
Or it decays after blackening, spreading the decay to the adjacent parts of the limb and into the rest of the body. In such cases, hurry to amputate it. Likewise, if the corruption is caused by the sting of a creature such as a sea scorpion, a snake, a tarantula, or the like.
If the corruption or sting is at the tip of the finger, cut off the finger without delaying the spread of corruption to the hand. Similarly, if it has affected the hand, cut it from the base of the wrist without delaying the corruption from spreading to the forearm.
Likewise, if the corruption spreads to the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow joint itself. If the corruption advances and you see it reaching the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder at all, as this would lead to the patient's death. Instead, resort to other treatments to the best of your ability.
Similarly, with the leg, if the corruption is in the toe, amputate the toe at one of its joints. If it spreads to the metatarsal, amputate the entire foot. If it ascends to the knee, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
If the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it and resign the patient to death. The method for amputating or sawing the limb is to tie a bandage below the area to be amputated and another above it.
One assistant pulls the lower bandage downward, and another pulls the upper bandage upward, while you strip the flesh between the bandages with a wide scalpel until the flesh is fully exposed, and then cut or saw. You should place linen cloths all around.
This prevents the saw from touching healthy tissue, which could cause the patient excessive pain and a hot swelling. If there is bleeding during the procedure, cauterize the site quickly or apply a styptic powder to stop the bleeding, and then continue your treatment until finished.
Then bandage the wounded limb with a suitable dressing and treat it until it heals. I will now tell you an example concerning a man whose leg was afflicted with the same condition I am describing. He developed blackness in his leg accompanied by a burning sensation resembling fire.
This corruption initially appeared in his toe and then affected the entire foot. Acting on his own, he decided to amputate the foot at the joint when he saw the corruption spreading through the limb and could no longer bear the intense pain and burning. He healed afterward.
After a long time, the same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand. He came to me, and I tried to halt the spread of the corruption by applying medications to his hand after cleansing his body, but the condition did not subside and began spreading to the next finger.
When the corruption affected his entire hand, he asked me to amputate it, but I refused, hoping to halt the corruption. I also feared that cutting off his hand might cause his death, as his strength was already greatly diminished. When he lost hope in me, he returned to his hometown.
I later learned that he had taken action himself and amputated his entire hand, after which he healed. I recounted this story to serve as guidance for handling this type of condition and as a practical example to follow.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
On treating abscesses and how to inject them with medications.
If a swelling develops in one of the fleshy organs and persists until it accumulates pus, then bursts or is lanced, releasing all the pus, leaving the area hollow as if it were a container.
The overlying skin, now as thin as a rag, has not reached the level of corruption that affects the bone, nerve, or ligament. In this case, it is called an abscess and not a fistula unless it persists long enough to damage one of these structures.
At that point, it is called a fistula or a chronic ulcer. Its treatment involves cutting away all the skin around it, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain it will not adhere to the area due to its corruption.
If you hope the skin will adhere and the corruption has not reached that level, and the skin retains some thickness of flesh, treat it with injection therapy. Examine the abscess; if it is large and emits foul-smelling pus, inject it with Egyptian medication.
It is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris in equal parts, combined in a vessel and cooked over the fire until the medicine thickens and reaches the consistency of honey. Then, take the needed amount, dilute it with water and honey, inject it into the cavity, seal its opening, and leave the medicine there for about two hours.
Then extract it by pressing; do this for several days until the cavity is cleansed and the foul odor disappears. If this medicine is unavailable, the cavity can be injected with lye water, which is prepared by taking the ashes of grapevine wood or oak wood and pouring water over them.
Then strain it and inject it until you are certain the cavity has been washed. If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the lye water, inject the cavity with a mixture of water and honey, to which a little powdered verdigris has been added.
Alternatively, inject it with honey mixed with wine, as honey cleanses and washes, while the wine adheres to the cavity, especially if the wine has astringent and drying qualities. When you have done this several times and are certain that the cavity’s corruption is gone, inject it with substances that promote flesh growth.
For example, take some palm ointment, dissolve it in rose oil and an astringent wine, or inject it with some of the other drugs and ointments whose properties we have described in the chapter on ointments. If the cavity opening is too narrow to accommodate the injector tube,
Widen it slightly with a metal instrument, or place a wick coated in Egyptian ointment or the sericon ointment to widen it. Similarly, if the opening is too wide, bring its edges together with stitches, leaving just enough room for the injector to enter without excess.
Also, if the opening from which the pus flows is situated too high, make an incision at its lowest point so that the pus can drain downward. This is because if pus accumulates in the depths of the cavity, it prevents the growth of flesh within it.
If you are unable to make an incision at the desired lower part of the cavity, position the affected limb in such a way that the pus flows out easily, ensuring that no pus remains trapped inside at all.
As for the healing medications applied externally to the cavity, the method is to take one of the healing ointments suitable for your purpose, spread it on a piece of linen cloth, ensuring the cloth is large enough to cover the entire cavity. Then, using scissors, cut a hole in the cloth opposite the cavity’s opening, making it slightly larger than the cavity opening. Next, spread a soft ointment on another piece of cloth sized to fit the hole and place it over the first cloth, positioning it so that pus can easily flow out of the cavity. Do not remove the large cloth until after
Several days. As for the cloth covering the cavity’s opening, it should be removed regularly to allow the accumulated pus to drain and to observe the discharge, determining whether it is abundant or scant, mature or immature.
In addition, inspect the cavity itself to determine whether the patient feels pain or not and whether there is swelling or not. If you continue the treatment in this manner and observe that the discharge from the cavity is minimal,
Know that the cavity has healed or is close to healing. At this point, untie it the next day or on the third day. When you untie the wound, replace the old cloths with new ones and refresh the ointment. If, after a long time, thin pus is discharged from the cavity, do not despair of its healing.
Its recovery is near because some people experience slow flesh growth in their wounds, while others are the opposite. If, after many days, immature pus is discharged from the cavity, know that the cavity has not healed. If the healing of the cavity is delayed,
And the condition persists, increase the drying agents in the medication. Use medications that are moist in consistency but drying in potency, such as the palm ointment with an added amount of colocynth. One of the most effective treatments involves using palm ointment.
Dissolve it in rose oil and sprinkle on it aged wine of moderate consistency, then knead it and use it. If the palm ointment is unavailable, you can achieve a similar effect with honey boiled until it thickens, or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, grind them all, and sprinkle them over the honey while it is on the fire. Then spread it on a piece of cloth and bind it to the cavity, or coat it with honey boiled until it thickens, sprinkle it with medicinal powders, and place the cloth over it, binding it securely.
For similar purposes, use long aristolochia, the root of the iris, blue iris, chickpea flour, and centaury, either individually or as a mixture. Grind and sift them, sprinkle them on the honey described, and use it. If the cavity persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depths.
If it has affected the bones or any of the hard nerves or ligaments, treat it as you would a fistula, as previously described.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
On the treatment of whitlow, bruised nails, the excision of extra fingers, and the splitting of fused fingers.
Whitlow is an excessive growth of flesh under the nail of the thumb on the hand or foot, and it may also occur under other nails. If left untreated for a long time, it becomes inflamed and swollen.
It may become corrupted and purulent, eating away at the nail root and potentially destroying the entire nail. The corruption might even reach the bone, emitting a foul odor, making the fingertip swollen and dark in color. If treated with the methods we have described and the treatment does not succeed,
You must cut away all the excess growth of flesh around the nail using a blade, then cauterize the wound afterward, as cauterization is very effective in this case. However, if the bone and nail are healthy,
And the corner of the nail is pressing inward, piercing and irritating the flesh, you should insert a thin probe under the corner of the nail causing the irritation, lift it upwards, and carefully cut away the affected flesh.
Apply corrosive and cauterizing medicines to the remaining flesh until it is completely gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the corruption has affected the bone, you must remove the diseased bone entirely, as healing will not occur as long as the bone remains corrupted.
If you observe the decay and corruption spreading within the finger, amputate it at one of the phalanges as previously described, then treat the wound until it heals. If the nail suffers a blow or bruise, causing severe pain, you should first perform bloodletting on the patient.
Then, split the nail with a sharp scalpel in a slanted cut from top to bottom, being careful not to extend the incision to the flesh beneath the nail. Doing so would cause severe pain to the patient and could lead to the growth of excess flesh in the area. Afterward, treat the site with remedies that alleviate pain.
As for extra fingers that grow on some people's hands, they may consist entirely of flesh, may contain some bone, or may even have a nail. Some grow at the base of the joint of a finger,
Or at one of the phalanges of a finger. Those that grow at a phalanx do not move, while those growing near a joint may move. If it is composed only of flesh, its removal is simple: cut it at its base using a broad scalpel.
Those that grow at the base of a joint are difficult to treat, so avoid cutting them. For those growing at a finger’s phalanx, you should first remove the flesh in a circular incision down to the bone, then saw the bone using an appropriate saw.
Then treat the site until it heals. As for the fusion of fingers, which often occurs either congenitally or as a result of wound healing, burn injuries, or similar causes, you should surgically separate the fusion.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape, then place between them a wick or cloth soaked in rose oil to prevent rapid adhesion, and separate them or place a thin lead plate between them so that the site heals as it should.
Similarly, if adhesion occurs between some fingers and the palm, sever that adhesion as appropriate to restore the proper shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On the excision of varicose veins.
Varicose veins are thick, twisted veins filled with black melancholic matter, occurring in various parts of the body, most commonly in the legs, especially among porters, farmers, and laborers. First, one should purge the body of black bile multiple times with a strong purge.
Then perform venesection on the basilic vein of the affected person. Treatment with iron is of two types: one involves incising and releasing the black blood, and the other involves stripping the vein and removing it entirely. For incising, follow this procedure: first, apply hot water generously to the leg.
Until the thick, turbid blood becomes softened. Then wrap the patient’s leg tightly with a cloth from above the thigh to below the knee, and make one, two, or three wide incisions in the vein.
Then extract the black blood by hand, moving from the lower part of the leg upward and from the upper part downward until an adequate amount of blood is released, or as much as the patient’s strength can bear. Then bandage the area and instruct the patient to avoid foods that produce black bile, and repeat the purging and venesection as needed.
When the veins become filled again and this harms the patient, stripping is done as follows: shave the patient’s leg if it has a lot of hair, then take them to a bathhouse and apply hot water to the leg until it reddens and sweat flows, or have them engage in vigorous exercise.
If a bathhouse is not available, warm the limb in other ways. Then make a longitudinal incision in the skin over the vein, either at its upper end near the knee or its lower end near the ankle. Open the skin with hooks and expose the vein from all sides until it becomes visible to the touch.
When it appears, it will look dark red. Once freed from the skin, it will resemble a tendon. Insert a probe beneath it, then lift it until it emerges from the skin and secure it with a smooth, blunt hook. Then make another incision near the first one, about three fingers apart.
Next, peel back the skin from the vein until it is fully exposed, then lift it with the probe as before and secure it with another hook, repeating the process to make additional incisions as needed.
Then strip the vein, cutting it at the last incision near the ankle. Pull and extract it until it emerges from the second incision, then pull it up to the next incision above. Continue this process until it is extracted from the third and highest incision. Once fully removed, cut it.
If the vein does not respond to pulling and stripping, insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread, tie it, and pull it. Then insert a probe beneath it and twist it with your hand in all directions until it comes out. Be cautious to avoid tearing it, as a tear makes extraction extremely difficult.
Such a tear can cause harm to the patient. Once the vein has been fully stripped, apply wool soaked in wine, rose oil, or olive oil to the wounds and treat the area until it heals. If the varicose vein is contracted and twisted with multiple curvatures in various directions.
And if it is not straight as previously described, incise it at each curvature and twist, securing it with hooks until it is entirely stripped. Exercise caution during incisions to avoid cutting or injuring the vein, as such damage makes stripping very difficult. Take utmost care.
Illustration of the hook used for incising varicose veins:.
Illustration of the blunt hook:.
It should not have the sharp bends of other hooks, nor should its tip be sharp to avoid injuring the vein. Instead, it should be thickly curved and smooth. If it is too thin, it may cut the vein due to its sharpness. Therefore, as mentioned, it should have a suitable thickness.
Chapter Ninety-One.
On the Extraction of the Madani Vein.
This vein develops in the legs in hot regions such as the Hijaz and the Arab lands, as well as in hot, arid regions with little fertility. It may sometimes form in other parts of the body besides the legs, arising from decay occurring beneath the skin.
Just as snakes, worms, gourds, and worms between the skin and flesh form within the body, the initial sign of this vein’s occurrence is intense inflammation in the leg, followed by blistering at the site, after which the vein begins to emerge from the blister.
It resembles the root of a plant or an animal. When its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing between one dirham and two dirhams, tied, and left hanging from the leg.
As more of it emerges, wrap it in lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut off a portion and continue wrapping the rest. Do not cut it off entirely at its base until it has fully emerged; cutting it prematurely will cause it to contract and retract into the flesh, resulting in swelling, decay, and a foul ulcer at the site.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and drawn out little by little until it is fully removed, leaving no part of it in the body. In some people, this vein can reach a length of five to ten cubits.
It has been reported that, in one case, it reached twenty cubits in length. If it breaks during treatment, insert a probe into the opening, making a deep incision along the body to drain all material, and apply antiseptic medications to the site for several days.
Then treat it as you would a swelling. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint or within the leg itself, creating multiple openings with branches emerging from each. Treat it as outlined earlier and according to the described divisions.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
On Incising for Worms Forming Beneath the Skin, Known as "The Cow Ailment."
This disease is called "The Cow Ailment" in some of our lands because it frequently occurs in cattle. It involves a small worm that forms between the skin and the flesh, crawling throughout the body, moving upward and downward.
Its movement from one organ to another is perceptible by touch until it pierces the skin wherever it chooses, emerging. Its formation arises from the putrefaction of certain humors, similar to the worms, snakes, and gourd seeds that occur in the abdomen.
The primary harm it causes is when it moves through the body, ascends to the head, and reaches the eye. It may pierce through the eye, emerge, and destroy vision—a frequent occurrence. If you intend to treat and extract it, this must be done when its movement and presence are perceptible.
You should tightly bind the area above and below it, then make an incision and extract it. If it sinks into the flesh and cannot be found, cauterize the area with fire to burn it. The most severe damage it may cause, as mentioned, is to the eye.
If it has reached the head near the eye, tightly bind below it along the forehead, then make an incision and extract it. The patient should regularly cleanse their body with purgative medicines to expel foul, putrid humors and avoid foods that generate decay.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
On Incising for the Disease Known as "The Protrusion."
This disease, known in our land as "The Protrusion," is a pain that appears in certain organs and then moves from one organ to another. I have observed it as I will describe to you.
I was called to treat a sick woman in a remote area. She uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in the vein of her forearm. After a short while, I saw the swelling move along her forearm like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as swiftly as mercury.
When it moved from one place to another, the pain disappeared from that spot and settled in the shoulder. Then, after an hour, it traveled through the body until it reached the other arm. She told me that it moved throughout her entire body in the manner I observed.
I marveled at how quickly it moved from one organ to another. I had never seen this disease with my own eyes in this manner before, although I had encountered people who reported pain shifting from one organ to another. However, I had not witnessed it firsthand as I did with this woman.
I concluded that this phenomenon was likely because the woman was from the desert, with a dry body and exposed veins. This allowed the migrating wind to be perceived, whereas it would not appear in the same way in those with softer, well-nourished bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels the pain, and it becomes visible as described, bind tightly above and below it immediately, then make an incision to release the trapped wind and cauterize the site.
If it is not visible to the eye, treat it by invigorating the body and using medications that dispel and diffuse winds, such as shabb al-muntin and habb al-sikbinj or similar remedies.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On Extracting Arrows.
Arrows vary according to their types and the parts of the body in which they lodge. As for their types, there are large and small arrows, some hollow glass and some solid glass, some with three edges, and others with four edges.
Some have tongues, while others have splinters. Regarding the organs where arrows may lodge, they are of two kinds: either major hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. If an arrow strikes one of these organs and the signs of impending death—which I will describe later—become apparent, you should avoid attempting to remove the arrow, as death will follow in most cases. If these dire signs do not appear and the arrow has not penetrated deeply into the organ, extract it and treat the wound. Among the signs of brain injury from an arrow that has pierced the bone and damaged the membrane covering the brain are severe headache, stupor, dizziness, and...
If these dire signs do not appear and the arrow has not penetrated deeply into the organ, extract it and treat the wound. Among the signs of brain injury from an arrow that has pierced the bone and damaged the membrane covering the brain are severe headache, stupor, dizziness, and... ...redness in the eyes and tongue, convulsions, mental confusion, occasional vomiting, and possibly bleeding from the nostrils or ears. Speech may cease, the voice may be lost, and a white moisture resembling porridge might ooze from the wound, accompanied by a fluid resembling meat broth.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient or attempting to remove the arrow if it has not already been removed. As for the signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is near the left breast and feels as if it has lodged in something solid rather than hollow...
The arrow may have a movement resembling a pulse. Black blood may flow from the wound, followed by cold extremities, cold sweat, and fainting. Know that death is inevitable. The sign of an arrow injuring the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels near the neck swell, the patient’s complexion changes, they breathe heavily, and they seek cool air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the lower ribs, causing labored breathing and severe pain.
There will be sighing, and all the parts of the shoulders will move. If the arrow strikes the liver, it will result in severe pain, with blood resembling the liver's red color flowing from the wound. If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food may emerge from the wound.
Its condition is apparent. If the arrow strikes the abdomen and becomes embedded, with feces emerging from the wound, or if the omentum or intestines are perforated, treatment is hopeless, as is removing the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine escapes...
...and part of the bladder protrudes outward with severe pain for the patient, know that they are doomed. As for the other organs, such as the face, eyes, throat, shoulder, upper arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they generally remain intact in most cases.
As long as the arrow does not strike an artery or nerve and is not poisoned. I will recount some of what I have witnessed regarding these arrows to guide you in treatment. An arrow once struck a man at the corner of his eye, near the base of his nose.
I extracted it from the opposite side, beneath the earlobe, and he recovered without any harm to his eye. Another time, I extracted an arrow from a Jew that had struck his eye socket below the lower eyelid. The arrow had lodged deeply, and only the small tip attached to the shaft was visible.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow with a smooth, square iron head and no barbs. The Jew recovered without any harm to his eye. I also extracted an arrow from the throat of a Christian; the arrow was of Arabic design.
This type of arrow had barbs. I made an incision between the jugular veins, as it had sunk deep into his throat. I delicately worked to extract it, and the Christian survived and recovered. Another arrow struck a man in the abdomen, and we anticipated his death.
After thirty days or so passed without any change in his condition, I incised the area, carefully maneuvered the arrow out, and he recovered without complications. I also saw a man struck by an arrow in his back, where the wound had closed over it.
After seven years, the arrow emerged from the base of his thigh, and I saw a woman struck in her abdomen by an arrow; the wound healed, and the arrow remained without altering her condition or causing her any harm in her natural functions.
I saw another man struck by an arrow in his face; the wound healed, and he did not experience much pain. Such cases are numerous. I extracted an arrow from a commander of the Sultan, which had struck the middle of his nose and slightly bent to the right.
The arrow was completely buried, and I was called to treat him three days after the incident. I found the arrow wound very narrow, so I probed it with a thin probe but could not locate it, although he felt a pricking pain beneath his right ear.
I hoped that the pricking sensation was from the tip of the arrow, so I applied a dressing with a pulling and maturing effect, hoping the area would swell and reveal the arrow's location for incision. However, no signs appeared indicating the arrow's presence there.
I continued applying the dressing for many days, but nothing happened, and the wound healed in the meantime. The patient gave up hope of its removal until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and informed me. I then applied a caustic medicine to the wound for many days.
The wound eventually opened, and upon probing it, I felt the thin tip of the arrow adhering to the cartilage. I continued enlarging the wound with the caustic medicine until the arrow's tip became visible. This process lasted about four months.
When the wound was sufficiently widened, I was able to insert forceps to grasp and move the arrow, but it did not respond to extraction. I continued maneuvering it with various instruments until one day I firmly grasped it with secure forceps, as illustrated at the end of this chapter.
The physicians believed that the cartilage of his nose could not heal, but I mended it, and the wound healed completely. The patient fully recovered without any issues. I now explain how to extract some types of arrows as a guide and model for cases not explicitly mentioned.
The details and parts of this craft cannot be fully grasped through description or comprehensively covered in a book. A skilled practitioner extrapolates from the few to the many, from the known to the unknown, devising new procedures and instruments for rare and unusual cases.
When engaging in this craft, I say that arrows are extracted from the tissues in which they are lodged in two ways: either by pulling them from the entry point or from the opposite direction.
If the arrow is protruding from a fleshy area, it can be pulled out. If it does not come out at the time of the injury, you should leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh decays, making it easier to pull out. The same applies if it is lodged in a bone.
If it does not respond to pulling, leave it for a few more days and try again with daily attempts to pull and move it, as it may eventually come out. If it still does not come out, you should drill around the arrow in the bone itself from all sides using a fine drill to create space, then pull it out.
If the arrow is lodged in the bone of the skull and has penetrated one of the brain's cavities, causing the patient to exhibit some of the symptoms I have described to you, refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it for a few days to evaluate the situation.
Proceed to extract the arrow. If it is deeply lodged and does not respond to pulling, use drills around the arrow as I have described, then treat the site until it heals. However, if the arrow has disappeared into a part of the body, And if it is not detectable by touch, probe for it with an instrument. If you locate it, pull it out using tools suitable for extraction. If you cannot remove it due to the narrowness of the wound or the arrow's deep position, and there is no bone, nerve, or blood vessel in the way,
Incise the area until the wound is wide enough to access the arrow and extract it. If it has barbs, grasp them and free the surrounding flesh by any means possible. If you cannot free the flesh, break and twist the barbs until you can remove them.
When attempting to remove an arrow from any location, rotate your hand with the forceps in all directions to loosen it, being exceedingly gentle to avoid breaking the arrow, which would complicate its extraction. If you cannot remove it at once,
Leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh decays, then attempt removal again, as it will become easier. If heavy bleeding occurs, use the treatments mentioned in their appropriate sections, taking great care to avoid cutting veins, nerves, or tendons.
Use every possible method to free the arrow, but always with care, patience, and precision as I have described. Position the patient in the same posture they were in when the arrow struck, as this facilitates the process.
If this is not possible, use any feasible position. For arrows to be removed from the opposite side, they may either have a part protruding outward or the arrow tip may be palpable and visible just beneath the skin.
Incise the area, making the cut just large enough to accommodate the forceps, then pull the arrow out. If it gets stuck in a bone, rotate your hand to create space around the arrow in the bone, then pull it out.
If this fails, leave it for a few days and try again. If the arrow's shaft is intact, push it through. If the shaft has fallen off and you need to push the arrow, use a hollow instrument to align with the arrow’s tail, then push it out.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out using an instrument that fits inside the hollow portion, as this will facilitate its removal. If the arrow is poisoned, carve out all the flesh affected by the poison if possible, then treat the area with appropriate remedies.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side and is close enough to be felt with a probe, you may incise the area carefully, avoiding veins and nerves, and remove the arrow.
Then stitch the wound if necessary and treat it until it heals. Below is an illustration of the forceps used for extracting arrows:
The tips resemble a bird's beak and are crafted to grip the arrow or any object firmly without slipping. They come in large, medium, and small sizes to match the arrow’s size and the wound’s width or narrowness.
Illustration of the hollow instrument:
Illustration of the solid instrument:
This solid-tipped instrument is like a probe, designed to easily enter a hollow arrow and push it out.
Chapter Ninety-Five.
On Venesection.
The veins customarily subjected to venesection in the body number thirty. Of these, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as al-Hasisain; the two arteries in the visible temples; and the two veins at the corners of the eyes, known as al-Nazirein.
There is also the vein extending vertically in the middle of the forehead, the vein at the tip of the nose, the two jugular veins in the neck, the two veins in the upper lip, the two veins in the lower lip—these are known as al-Jahark—and the two veins beneath the tongue.
As for the veins subjected to venesection in the arm and hand, they are five: one is the Cephalic vein, located on the outer side, which the common people call the "head vein." Another is the Median cubital vein, the middle vein formed by a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic, known as the "body vein" among commoners.
The Basilic vein, situated on the inner side, is also called the axillary vein and is referred to by commoners as the "belly vein." There is also the "cord of the arm," located on the forearm, which adheres to it and is clearly visible above the thumb, as well as the Asilum.
The Asilum vein is located between the ring finger and the little finger, with two branches. In the leg and foot, there are three veins: one is beneath the knee joint on the outer side, another is the Saphenous vein located near the ankle on the inner side, and the third is the Sciatic vein, situated at the heel on the outer side.
The other leg has three similar veins. As for the two veins behind the ears, their venesection benefits chronic catarrh, migraines, scalp sores, and chronic malignant head ulcers. The method for venesection is as follows:
Shave the patient’s head and rub the back of the head at the site of the two veins vigorously with a coarse cloth. Then, constrict the patient’s neck with a bandage until the veins become visible at the two depressions behind the ears. Palpate the area with your finger, and where you feel their pulse, mark it with ink.
Take a scalpel, specifically one known as al-Nashl, and insert it beneath the vein into the skin until it reaches the bone. Then, lift your hand along with the vein and the skin upward and sever the vein along with the skin in a clean cut, about the length of two joined fingers.
Or similar, and let out the amount of blood you desire, then bandage them with dressings and leave them until they heal. Their cutting and cauterizing were mentioned earlier in the book. As for the two arteries in the temples, their venesection is beneficial for chronic migraines, severe headaches, persistent eye inflammation, and the acute discharges flowing into the eyes.
The method of their venesection is as I will describe: the patient’s neck is compressed with a turban until the veins are clearly felt and their pulse becomes distinct under your finger. Then mark the location with ink, lift the skin above the vein upward with your forefinger,
Insert the Nashal scalpel from below, raise the vein upward, and sever it as you did with the other two veins. Let out the required amount of blood, then loosen the turban around the patient’s neck and press your finger on the vein for a while.
Then place cotton and a dressing over it, securing it tightly, and leave it until it heals. Their description, cutting, and drawing were mentioned earlier in the book. As for venesection of the forehead vein, it is beneficial after the cephalic vein for chronic facial conditions such as scalp issues, sores, and ugly redness.
The method of its venesection is as I will describe: compress the patient’s neck with a turban until the vein appears, then take the tool known as the axe, which is shaped as follows:.
Place the protruding prong at the head of the axe on the vein itself and strike it from above with a comb or similar object, allowing the blood to flow to the desired extent. Then loosen the turban from the patient’s neck and bind the wound until it heals.
It can also be opened with a broad scalpel, but the scalpel should not have a sharp tip like other scalpels. Instead, it should be slightly broad-tipped, and the incision should be oblique because the bone is close and the scalpel might break if it is thin.
As for the two veins in the corners of the eyes, their venesection benefits eye ailments such as scabies, redness, trachoma, and facial diseases. The method of venesection is to compress the patient’s neck with a turban, then incise them while standing above the patient. The incision should be slightly oblique and longitudinal using a small, slightly broad scalpel.
Since the location has no flesh, a thin-tipped scalpel might break. Let out the desired amount of blood, place cotton on the site, and bandage it for one night before removing it. As for venesection of the nasal vein, it is useful for acute fevers.
And for severe headaches and facial conditions like the red blotches that appear on the nose, especially if chronic. The method of venesection involves compressing the patient’s neck, then holding their nose with your left hand while using a thin, long scalpel.
Insert it directly into the center of the nasal tip, between the nasal cartilage, because the vein is not visible to the touch there. The blood will immediately flow. You should insert the scalpel slightly deeper, let out the needed blood, and then bandage it for one night, as it heals quickly.
As for the two jugular veins, their venesection benefits shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and melancholic diseases affecting the skin surface, such as black vitiligo, ringworm, malignant ulcers, and necrotizing sores. The method involves tying the patient’s neck beneath them with a band and having the practitioner stand over the patient.
The patient should sit on a chair, and the vein is incised longitudinally with a slightly broad incision. Let out a moderate amount of blood or as needed, and then repeat the same procedure for the other vein. Finally, remove the band.
Bind the veins moderately to avoid strangling the patient, and leave them until the next day for the wound to heal. As for the veins of the Jahark, their venesection, after the cephalic vein, benefits conditions such as oral ulcers, gum disease, malignant sores, cracked lips, and bad sores.
These are conditions that occur in the nose and its surroundings. The method of venesection involves seating the patient in front of you, compressing their neck with a turban, then turning their lips outward and observing the two veins—one on the right of the upper lip and the other on the left. You can distinguish them by their dark color.
Around these are also thin, dark veins, which you sever completely. If you are unsure and cannot identify them, aim to cut the largest and most visible ones. The same procedure applies to the veins in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, their venesection, after the cephalic vein, benefits throat inflammations, uvula diseases, and oral conditions. The method involves seating the patient before you facing the sunlight, raising their tongue, and observing the veins under the tongue—one on each side—distinguished by their dark color.
Incise them carefully without going too deep, as there are arteries beneath them that may cause excessive bleeding. As for the three veins that are venesected in the elbow, they are commonly venesected in all individuals and can be incised in two ways.
Either by piercing with a broad Rihani scalpel or an olive-shaped thin one, or by making an incision with a knife-like scalpel, which is called the Nashal [and this is its image]. The image of the broad Rihani scalpel:.
It is broad, as you see, and suitable for opening prominent, thick, convex veins filled with thick, cloudy blood. This is the image of the olive-shaped scalpel:.
This scalpel is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for venesecting delicate veins that contain thin, yellowish blood. This is the image of the Nashal scalpel:.
This scalpel, suitable for incision, comes in broad and thin varieties depending on the width and narrowness of the veins, and it serves as a reference for others. It is well-known among practitioners.
As for the basilic vein, one of the three main veins, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from ailments beneath the throat and neck, extending to the chest and abdomen. The practitioner must be cautious during its incision and remain vigilant, for beneath it lies an artery that, if mistakenly struck deeper with the scalpel, could sever the artery.
This would cause blood hemorrhage, so its phlebotomy should not be performed with a piercing scalpel but with an incision scalpel. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, it is better to avoid it, switch to another vein, or seek one of its branches.
Alternatively, you can incise the vein in the arm, as it is prominent, and open it with the incision scalpel as previously mentioned. If you wish to target it directly, you must palpate the site before tying the arm to locate the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then tie the arm and make an angled incision in the vein with the incision scalpel as mentioned. Ensure the incision is placed away from the artery. If, upon tightening the ligature, you notice swelling at the site marked with ink, this swelling indicates the artery; avoid it.
If you observe the blood spurting like a child’s urine during incision, and it is thin and red, know that it comes from the artery. Quickly press your finger on it for an extended time, then release. If the bleeding stops, it often ceases entirely. Then bind the arm.
Leave it, and warn the patient against neglect. Let them stay cautious and avoid moving the arm for days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and overwhelms you, and you lack immediate treatment, sever the artery if visible. Its ends will contract, stopping the bleeding.
Alternatively, take a pistachio shell, split it, use one half, and tie it firmly over the vein with a bandage until the next day. If the bleeding stops, that suffices; otherwise, treat it as previously described using styptic powders. Stopping the bleeding is not difficult in most cases.
This is due to the small size of the wound and the ease of binding the arm. As for the median vein, its phlebotomy benefits by drawing blood from the upper head and lower body, as it combines branches from the basilic and cephalic veins, as previously mentioned.
The practitioner must be cautious during its incision because a nerve lies beneath it. If the scalpel penetrates too deeply and strikes the nerve, numbness may occur, which is difficult to heal and may never recover. This nerve is often detectable by touch.
If the nerve is hidden in some individuals or is too thin to discern, perform the incision with an incision scalpel and take utmost care to avoid the nerve. If the vein lies between two nerves, incise the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, its phlebotomy draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for treating eye diseases. For this vein specifically, if you wish to incise it, use the olive-shaped scalpel or the broad myrtle-shaped scalpel, as it is the safest of all veins, having neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it.
However, when incising, avoid the head of the muscle with the scalpel and seek the soft area. It does not harm if the incision is not successful on the first attempt and is repeated, though it may cause swelling in some people if not done properly the first time.
Yet, such swelling does not cause significant harm. As for the method of phlebotomy, its symptoms, and its preparation, first, it is essential to understand that phlebotomy is used either to maintain health alone.
Or it is used for treating diseases. When employed to maintain health and prevent the onset of illnesses, phlebotomy should target one of the three veins at the elbow—the cephalic, median, or basilic—and be performed in early spring when signs of fullness appear.
Phlebotomy should be performed on a Sunday or Tuesday, three hours after sunrise. However, phlebotomy for treating diseases has no fixed time and is done whenever the need or urgency arises, be it day or night.
It can be performed at any hour or time. Children should not undergo phlebotomy until they are fourteen years old, nor should the elderly who are over sixty. If someone resolves to perform phlebotomy for any purpose.
They must cleanse their bowels with a mild enema before the procedure if there is significant retained waste to prevent putrid matter from being drawn into the veins during phlebotomy, which could harm vital organs. Intoxicated, drunk, or overfed individuals should not undergo phlebotomy until they recover.
Avoid phlebotomy immediately following dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, exhaustion, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, or anything else that weakens physical or mental strength. Beforehand, consider thinning the humors if the blood is thick.
Use foods, drinks, and medicines to achieve this, if possible. Then enter a bath unless contraindicated or engage in light exercise to thin the blood. Schedule the phlebotomy for early in the day and aim to clear the mind of all negative emotions that day.
Such as worry, anger, and fear, as well as physical conditions like extreme exhaustion, fatigue, and intercourse. Arrange the environment with items typically used, such as fragrances, flowers, entertainments, and similar things, to the extent possible for each person.
Then the practitioner should sit on a cushion higher than the one the patient is seated on. The patient's arm is extended, and the practitioner rubs it with their hand two or three times before tying the ligature firmly, twisting it two or three times. The tying should be moderate.
If the tying is not moderate—either excessively tight, which blocks blood flow, or too loose, which also hinders blood flow—adjust accordingly. After tying, the patient should rub both hands together briskly.
Until the veins swell and become perceptible to the touch, the practitioner should lightly wipe the scalpel with old oil. Then, they place the index finger of their left hand directly on the vein, just below the spot intended for incision, to prevent the vein from slipping away from the cut. Some veins behave like a string and slip away when incised, while others are filled with air; when the scalpel is placed upon them, they sink below it, deceiving the practitioner, and the scalpel does not open the vein—or if it does, the opening is narrow.
Therefore, the practitioner must act carefully and deliberately in all these matters. They should then lower the scalpel; if the vein is not opened on the first attempt, they should try again slightly below or above the spot, swiftly, provided the area has not swollen.
If the area swells or the patient becomes distressed, stop for a day or two and avoid tightening the ligature, as this may cause an inflammatory swelling, and do not permit the patient to bathe. Then, if desired, resume the incision. If the scalpel punctures and the opening is small, and the blood flow is thin,
And you fear that the desired amount of blood may not flow, reintroduce the scalpel into the same puncture, gently, in a straight motion, enlarging the opening slightly. Do this swiftly before the area swells, as small openings often lead to swelling in many individuals.
If you observe swelling, do not attempt another incision, as it will not help. Apply dregs of oil to the area, as this facilitates blood flow better than oil itself or other ointments in this case.
Use oil dregs for all venesections when blood flow is difficult. Alternatively, applying antidotes like Al-Farooq or Shikhzania to the site can thin and loosen thick blood.
If a large swelling occurs at the incision site—a common occurrence, especially in first-time patients or when the vein's opening is small—immediately apply a sponge soaked in slightly warmed saltwater, bandaging it for an hour, as this will dissipate the swelling.
This should be done after the blood has completely exited from the vein itself or from another vein. If some black or green discoloration remains in the area after a few days, it is harmless. However, if you wish, you may apply a solution of aloe and myrrh to it.
Or you can use an extract of pennyroyal or something similar. Swellings and protrusions often occur after venesection of the basilic vein. If, upon pressing, you feel it pulsating, this indicates a dangerous protrusion, so avoid applying any of the mentioned substances.
This could result in arterial bleeding. Instead, dress the site with an astringent to firm the area, then treat it with other remedies until it heals. The amount of blood to be extracted should correspond to the individual's strength and the predominant color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red. Similarly, if it is thick, let it flow until it becomes thin, and if it is sharp, continue until its sharpness subsides. For someone robust and requiring significant bloodletting in one session,
The vein's incision should be widened, and a broad scalpel should be used. Conversely, for a weaker individual, perform the bloodletting in multiple sessions with a narrow opening. The best technique for venesection involves a slanted, oblique incision rather than a puncture.
This method minimizes bleeding and nerve damage, making it preferable and safer than horizontal or longitudinal incisions. For those prone to fainting during venesection, provide them with bread soaked in sour pomegranate juice or oxymel before the procedure.
If the individual has a warm temperament, let their blood be drawn in three or four sessions. For those with a cold temperament, give them bread soaked in mead, spiced honeyed drink, or aromatic herbal wine before venesection.
If fainting occurs during venesection due to excessive blood loss, give the patient meat broth and light aromatic wine. Use perfumed unguents to massage their chest and employ other remedies mentioned earlier in the section on fainting.
That which occurs due to purging. As for someone who wishes to ease their arm and let their blood flow a second time, if the first venesection involved excessive purging and their strength is weak, the blood should be let out gradually, over successive days, according to their capacity.
For someone desiring to ease their arm and let their blood flow again and whose body is strong, this can be done seven or nine hours after the first venesection. As for someone seeking to draw blood away from a specific part of their body to the opposite direction, this should be done on the second or third day.
If a person has an abundance of blood that has become hot and sharp, causing fever, their blood should be removed in a single session, in large quantities, and the incision should be widened until fainting occurs, but only after ensuring all conditions for venesection are met. Place your hand on their pulse during the bloodletting to prevent death from occurring in place of fainting, as this often happens due to the negligence or ignorance of the practitioner. If you wish to loosen the arm and let the blood flow again,
And the vein's opening has closed, making it difficult for the blood to flow, do not press on it forcefully or twist it harshly, as this is very harmful. Instead, either leave it for a second venesection or use the blade of the scalpel to remove the clotted blood from the vein's opening.
Alternatively, apply some salt dissolved in water to the vein, or use some of the "Teriac al-Farooq" or "Shakhnazaya" remedies, and gently press the vein until the blood begins to flow. However, if the vein has swollen, leave it alone.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides; if it becomes necessary to let out blood again, you may either perform the incision above that spot, or on the other arm, or on another vein.
As for the incision of the arm's vein, it substitutes for the basilic or cephalic veins when they are unavailable or hidden, as it is a combination of them. The method involves immersing the patient’s hand in hot water until the wrist reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible, then tying it moderately tight above with a bandage.
Next, make the incision on the vein at a slight angle, neither transversely nor longitudinally, ensuring the opening is wide. Perform the incision just above the wrist joint; if blood flow is difficult, immerse the hand in hot water again and let the blood flow into the water.
Continue until the desired amount of blood is drawn. In summer, reheating the hand in water may not be necessary, but in winter, hot water is often needed to maintain blood flow. This vein is safer to incise than others. This is because no pulsating artery or nerve lies beneath it. Incision of the median vein of the right hand benefits liver ailments. The method involves tying the wrist with a band or hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells.
This is because no pulsating artery or nerve lies beneath it. Incision of the median vein of the right hand benefits liver ailments. The method involves tying the wrist with a band or hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells. When the vein becomes clearly discernible, incise it at a slight angle. Even if you sever it completely, it will cause no harm. Exercise caution not to insert the scalpel deeply, as finger nerves lie beneath and the area lacks much flesh. Then reimmerse the hand in hot water.
Let the blood flow into the water. Without reheating in hot water, blood at the vein's opening may coagulate and block flow. Once the required amount is drawn, apply oil and salt to the vein to prevent rapid closure.
The same method applies to every narrow branch of a vein. Incision of the left hand vein benefits spleen ailments, performed identically as the other. As for the great saphenous vein, its incision benefits lower body ailments like uterine disorders.
It also helps with menstrual retention, kidney diseases, chronic sores of the thighs and legs, and similar conditions. The method involves immersing the foot in hot water, rubbing it to dilate the veins, then tying above the ankle with a bandage. The vein is located near the ankle toward the big toe.
Branches from this vein spread widely across the foot. Incise its broadest branch or near the ankle where it converges, as this is safest and best. If you incise it on the foot's surface, be cautious of the nerves beneath.
Make the incision at an angle, as if intending to sever it, and use a shallow scalpel stroke. If blood does not flow, immerse the foot in hot water again and let the blood flow until the desired amount is drawn. If the vein is missed initially.
Try again slightly higher. The site is safe if you avoid the nerves, as mentioned. Follow the same procedure for the saphenous vein of the other leg. Regarding the sciatic vein, its location is near the heel on the outer side.
Its incision relieves hip pain caused by hot blood. The method involves placing the patient in a bath and promptly tying the leg, from the hip to above the ankle, with a thin, long bandage four fingers wide, as the vein only becomes visible this way.
Once it appears, incise it in whichever manner works best for you—preferably at an angle, though severing it completely or making a slit are also options, as the site is safe. In most people, however, it is very hidden, and if you cannot locate it.
And if it does not become discernible at all, incise one of its branches, which appear on the top of the foot near the little toe and ring toe. Exercise caution regarding the nerves and let the desired amount of blood flow.
Then release the bandage, place a piece of cotton on the incision site, and tie it up again. The site will heal quickly.
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On cupping and its methods of application.
Cupping instruments may be made of horns, wood, copper, or glass. Cupping is performed in two ways: either with incision and bloodletting or without incision.
This non-incisive cupping is also of two types.
Other points include the jugular veins on both sides of the neck, under the jawbone (chin), the shoulders, the sacrum (base of the spine), the middle of the arms, the legs, and the Achilles tendons.
Cupping draws blood from the thin veins spread throughout the flesh. Because of this, it does not weaken the body as much as venesection (bloodletting). Cupping, whether with or without fire, should not be used in conditions caused by excess until the body has been thoroughly evacuated.
If the need for cupping arises due to illness or custom, it can be practiced at any time—at the start, middle, or end of the month, and in any season.
This is because some people, when blood accumulates excessively and requires cupping, feel heaviness and headaches in their heads. Others experience fullness and redness in the face, head, and neck. Some feel itching in the face, sides, or darkness and discomfort in the eyes. Others itch at the site of cupping points.
Some people laugh excessively, some taste blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit blood. Others sleep excessively or dream of blood, redness, corpses, wounds, and similar visions. Whenever we observe such symptoms.
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we prescribe cupping at that time, two or three hours after sunrise. The benefit of cupping at the nape is that it relieves head heaviness and watery discharge into the eyes.
However, it should be done only after the body has been generally purged. This cupping can serve as a substitute for venesection of the cephalic vein. It is important to avoid using it for individuals with a cold brain or those suffering from a catarrh, as it can cause significant harm.
For this reason, the elderly and those with cold ailments in their heads should not undergo it. Excessive reliance on it can lead to memory loss.
Thus, it is advisable to instruct the cupper to lower their hand slightly with the cup to avoid inducing memory loss. As for cupping the upper back, it serves as a substitute for venesection of the median and basilic veins.
It benefits conditions such as asthma, shortness of breath, respiratory discomfort, coughs, and fullness. The cupping should be applied slightly higher on the upper back, as placing it lower can weaken the heart and stomach.
Cupping the jugular veins benefits head pain, eye inflammation, migraines, angina, and tooth root aches. It serves as a substitute for venesection of the basilic vein. The cupper should be instructed not to cut too deeply, to avoid severing an artery and causing excessive bleeding.
Cupping under the chin helps with oral ulcers, gum decay, and similar mouth conditions, and can substitute for venesection of the vessels in the lips. Cupping the shoulders benefits heart palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
Cupping the inner sides of the forearms provides the same benefits as venesection of the three veins (basilic, median, and cephalic). It draws blood from all the thin veins in the flesh, which, in turn, pull from thicker veins until the suction reaches the three large veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to incise too deeply, as the area has little flesh and is close to nerves and arteries. As for cupping at the coccyx, it benefits hemorrhoids and lower body sores.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large cupping vessel made of copper, as the area requires strong suction. Glass cups may break, and multiple incisions are needed. Cupping the legs significantly reduces fullness.
It draws blood from the entire body, alleviating chronic pain in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, promotes menstrual flow, and helps with boils and abscesses. It substitutes for venesection of the saphenous and Achilles veins but weakens the body significantly and often causes fainting. The benefit of cupping the Achilles region is similar to that of leg cupping.
The method of applying cups involves placing an empty cup first, applying moderate suction. Do not leave the cups on for too long; instead, apply and remove them quickly to draw fluids evenly to the area. Repeat this process until the area becomes red and opens up.
When the redness of blood appears, make the incisions and reapply suction gradually. Observe the patient's condition. For those with soft flesh and loose pores, only one incision should be made to avoid causing ulcers in the area.
Instruct the cupper to make wide and slightly deep incisions and to balance the suction gently with slight movements. If the blood is thick, two incisions should be made: the first to allow the lighter, watery blood to flow, and the second to remove the thick blood completely.
If the blood is very turbid, a third incision may be needed to fully extract it. Generally, if a small amount of blood is to be removed, one incision suffices. For larger amounts, more incisions are necessary, especially if the blood is thick.
The incision should be deep enough, with the ideal depth being just to the level of the skin. Regarding the oils and waters to use during cupping, and precautions for the cupped individual: for those with thick, tough, dry skin and tight pores.
The cupping areas should be anointed with softening, opening, and relaxing oils. In summer, suitable oils include jasmine oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
In winter, appropriate oils include narcissus oil, iris oil, chamomile oil, or lily oil. For thick, cold humors, use oils like marjoram, mint, oil of ben, or dill oil.
If the patient undergoing cupping has wide pores and soft flesh, they should avoid oils, and these individuals should wash their cupping instruments after the procedure with rose water, cold water, water of gooseberries, gourd water, purslane water, or the like. As for those whose blood contains much moisture.
They should wash their instruments with vinegar, myrtle water, sumac water, or the like. As for those whose bodily residues are thick, their instruments should be washed with aged wine, marjoram water, dill decoction, chamomile decoction, or the like. One should avoid cupping in the bathhouse or immediately after a bath.
Instead, it should be performed an hour or two after leaving the bathhouse, and no one should sleep after cupping. Proper measures should be taken for the patient undergoing cupping or bloodletting before and after the procedure.
First, you must assess the patient. If the person undergoing cupping or bloodletting is bilious, and their blood predominantly sharp and inflamed, they should consume cooling substances such as pomegranate, chicory with vinegar, lettuce, oxymel, rose syrup, and the like. Their food should include young chickens, lamb meat stews, sour dishes, and similar foods.
For those with a cold temperament, they should be given honeyed beverages, myrrh wine, or basil oxymel. They may consume fragrant wine that is intermediate between old and new. They should be advised to eat less, focusing on foods such as young chickens, partridges, sparrows, young pigeons in white broth. On the day of cupping or bloodletting, drinking should exceed eating.
At times, some people may need to be given the antidote al-Farouq, musk medicine, or shiltha before or after cupping or bloodletting to strengthen the vital organs and thin the blood, but it should not be given to those with a hot temperament.
As for cupping instruments that are used without incision, they are placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidneys, and hip joint because these areas cannot tolerate incisions. Their purpose is to draw blood from one organ to another.
For example, placing the cup on the breasts in cases of nosebleeds, or using it to disperse cold winds trapped in an organ, such as placing the cup on the abdomen and navel to loosen, warm, and alleviate pain by dissolving that wind.
It may also be applied to the kidneys in cases of blockage or stones; with its suction power, it may open the blockage or dislodge the stones from their place. Similarly, it can be applied to the liver and spleen in cases of wind distressing them. These cups may be used empty, relying solely on suction.
They can also be used with fire or filled with lukewarm water for treating colic. In such cases, the cup is filled, preferably a large one, with hot water alone or water in which certain beneficial herbs have been boiled.
The cup is then placed, filled, on the affected area, held in place, removed, and reapplied multiple times as needed. This is the design of the fire-heated cup:
Its mouth is about two fingers wide, as we have described, with a depth of half a span. On its side, approximately halfway up, there is a small hole just large enough to insert a needle. It is made of Chinese brass or yellow brass with thick edges.
It is smooth, even, and polished so as not to harm the organ when applied. In its center, there is a horizontal bar made of brass or iron where the candle or flame is placed. The cup can be made larger or smaller than described, depending on the condition being treated.
The size of the cup depends on the patient, as the cups used for children and the slender differ from those used for men and those with robust bodies. As for the method of applying this fire-heated cup to the body, a wick made of tightly woven linen or a small candle of pitch is lit and placed at the center of the bar fixed in the middle of the cup.
This ensures the flame rises upwards toward the base of the cup and prevents the patient’s body from burning. The cup is then placed on the organ, with a finger covering the previously mentioned hole until the cup adheres firmly, at which point the finger is removed.
Steam escapes through the hole, and the cup detaches from the area. The wick is then prepared again in the same manner and reapplied if necessary. As for the cup used for treating colic with water, it does not contain a fixed bar or hole.
It is simply used by filling it with water and placing it on the affected organ. This is its design:
The larger this type of cup is, to hold more water, the better.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
On the Application of Leeches.
Leeches are primarily used in cases where cupping cannot be applied, either due to the small size of the area, such as the lips and gums, or because the organ is devoid of flesh, such as the fingers and nose.
The method of using leeches involves selecting those found in clean, fresh water free of impurities, then leaving them in fresh water for a day and night so that they become hungry and their insides are completely empty. The body is first purged through bloodletting or cupping, after which the affected organ is wiped.
Until it reddens, then it is placed on it, and when it fills, it falls off. If it is possible to suction the site with a cupping glass, that is more beneficial. Otherwise, wash the site with vinegar and then with plenty of water, rub it, and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and there is oozing, soak a linen cloth in cold water.
Place it on top until the oozing stops. If the bleeding increases, sprinkle powdered vitriol or oak galls or similar astringents on it until the blood stops, or place peeled halves of lupines on the site.
Leave it until the lupine sticks to the site, as this will stop the bleeding. If it is necessary to reapply leeches, do not use the same ones if others are available. If the leeches refuse to attach, rub the site with fresh blood.
Or prick the site with a needle to release some blood, then place the leech, as it will attach when it senses some blood. If you wish to remove it, sprinkle some aloe, salt, or ash on it, and it will fall off the site.
Chapter Three.
On Bone Setting.
This chapter is also among the essential topics in the art of medicine, which is the setting of fractures and dislocations in bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is often claimed by ignorant physicians, commoners, and those who have never reviewed a book by the ancients on it or read even a single letter.
For this reason, this branch of knowledge has become extinct in our land, and I have never encountered anyone skilled in it. I only acquired what I did from it due to my extensive reading of the books of the ancients and my dedication to understanding them until I extracted knowledge from them, and then committed myself to practice and experience throughout my life.
I have outlined for you in this chapter everything encompassed by my knowledge. This has been refined through my experience, after simplifying it for you, removing extraneous details, summarizing it to the utmost, clarifying it thoroughly, and illustrating it with many depictions of the instruments used in it.
This is for added clarification, as I did in the preceding two chapters. There is no power except through God, the Most High, the Almighty.
Chapter One.
Concerning the basics and generalities of fractures, which must be introduced before discussing broken and dislocated limbs one by one, it is necessary to begin this chapter with general statements and sections. These first require you to understand them and grasp their reality, whether it is you or others keen to learn this noble craft.
I say, whenever someone suffers a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall, it is necessary to first hasten to bleed them, purge them, or do both. Unless there is an impediment, such as weak strength, the patient being a child or an elderly person, or the weather being extremely hot or cold.
Then restrict the diet to cold vegetables, poultry meat, and goat meat, while avoiding drinks, heavy meats, overeating, and all foods that fill the veins with blood until swelling is avoided and no material is expected to flow to the site.
At that point, the patient can return to their usual regimen. When the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should consume foods that provide substantial, thick, and solid nourishment with viscosity, such as porridge, rice, heads, trotters, cow tripe. Eggs, fresh fish, thick drinks, and similar items, as this regimen will ensure the fracture heals faster and better. Be aware that fractured bones in robust men and the elderly can never completely join and fuse back to their original nature.
This is due to the dryness and hardness of their bones. However, bones that are extremely soft, like those of young children, may connect and fuse. Nature produces a glue-like substance around the fractured bone that thickens and adheres, binding and holding it together.
It binds each part together until it achieves the utmost strength and firmness, as it was originally, ensuring that no action is hindered.
For this reason, the patient’s diet must consist of foods with firmness, viscosity, and thickness, as mentioned earlier. Be aware that fractures vary according to the affected bone; a leg bone fracture differs from a skull fracture, and a chest bone fracture differs from a spine fracture.
Similarly, all other bones differ from one another. We will discuss each type of fracture, explained in its respective section and differentiated from others. The type of bone fracture itself may also vary.
A fracture may involve a simple break without splinters, a longitudinal fracture along the bone with splinters that are detached or not detached, a fracture with an accompanying wound and skin rupture, or a minor fissure fracture.
Each type of fracture requires a specific method of treatment, which will be detailed in its respective section. Signs of a bone fracture include its bending, protrusion, being perceptible to touch, and crepitus when pressed with your hand.
If there is no apparent bending, crepitus, or noticeable instability when palpating the bone, and the patient does not experience significant pain, there is no fracture. It may be a sprain, a minor fracture, or a slight crack, and it should not be manipulated or pressed at all.
Rather, apply to it medicines suitable for the site, as will be mentioned later, and then bind it gently. Be aware that if the bone is broken into two without splinters, but each part has shifted from its counterpart.
You should promptly align and straighten it before it swells with inflammation. If it becomes inflamed, leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides, then straighten it in any way you can with gentleness and ingenuity.
Be aware that aligning and straightening it is easier than a bone with splinters. Then it is to be bound as will be described. If the bone has splinters, the fractured limb, whether arm or leg, must be stretched from both sides.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two cords, or with a combination of cord and hand. Place the limb on a flat surface in its natural shape so that when the fractured bone parts are extended, you can then return the splinters to their positions in every way possible with gentleness and ingenuity.
Take utmost care not to cause the patient pain or distress through your actions, and strive to join one bone with its counterpart in the best possible alignment. At that time, you should feel and examine them with your hand, and if you detect anything misaligned, correct and straighten it as much as you are able.
Avoid excessive stretching and forceful pressing as done by many ignorant practitioners, which often causes hot swelling or permanent damage to the limb, as I have observed their actions many times.
After alignment, accuracy, and binding, ensure the limb remains still and at rest. Warn the patient not to move it during waking, sleeping, turning, agitation, or any other movements to the best of their ability. They should position the limb in a way that avoids pain.
If they feel pain or discomfort in its current position, they should move it to a position that is pain-free while ensuring that this new position remains straight and level.
This is to prevent the limb from becoming crooked as it heals. As for how to bind the fractured limb, it is as I will describe to you. Know that fractured limbs vary in size and shape. Smaller ones, like the arm, finger, or forearm, require different methods.
The bandages for small parts should be soft and light, while those for larger parts like the thigh, back, or chest should be wide and firm. This is because a wide bandage holds a large limb securely from all sides with even pressure, leaving no gaps.
Then, after you finish the alignment, you begin to apply the appropriate dressing for it. In a soft fabric over the fracture site, then begin wrapping the bandage over the fracture site itself three or four times, depending on what the limb requires, and tighten the bandage slightly with your hand before moving it upward above the fracture site.
Tighten it less than at the fracture site itself, gradually loosening the wrap as you move away from the fracture, ensuring you cover enough of the healthy area. Then take another bandage and wrap it again around the fractured area.
Wrap it around several times, extending the wrapping towards the lower side of the fracture, following the same tension and relaxation method as mentioned for the upper wrap. Place soft wadding or cloth between the wraps to correct any misalignment in the fracture.
If there is a misalignment, use these materials; otherwise, omit them. Then wrap another bandage over this and immediately apply firm splints to the wraps if the limb shows no swelling or hot inflammation.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply remedies that reduce the swelling and eliminate puffiness, and wait a few days. Then, apply the splints. The splints should be made of broad, split, carved reeds prepared skillfully, or from sieve wood.
These can be made from pine wood, palm fronds, heather wood, or colic wood, or similar materials available. Each splint should have the width and shape as described.
Except the splint placed directly over the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others. The length of the splint should match the size of the fractured limb, whether large or small. (Diagram of the splint.)
Then bind the splints with another bandage, just as you did before. Tie it above with secure threads, ensuring the tension is greatest at the fracture site. The further you move from the fracture site, the less tension should be applied.
The threads should be of medium thickness and softness, preferably made of damp linen. Thick threads, as ignorantly used by some who twist coarse linen strips, are a serious mistake.
Thick threads cause uneven tension, while thin ones are unsuitable as they fail to provide the necessary tightness. There should be at least a finger's width between each splint.
If the patient is hurt by the splint edges after tightening, place soft wadding or loose wool underneath to prevent discomfort. If the fracture involves a wound or a break in the skin, this will be discussed separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be bound with splints on the first day, because if the limb is large, splints should not be applied until after five, seven, or more days, depending on your assurance of avoiding the occurrence of severe swelling.
This is the description of the dressings used by the ancients for fractures, dislocations, and sprains—a simple general dressing that sets fractures and suits most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is neither overly hot nor cold.
It involves taking the millstone dust, which is the flour residue that clings to the walls of the mill during its operation, and kneading it as it is without sifting, with egg white, making the dough neither too thick nor too thin, and then using it.
Another dressing for fractures, dislocations, and sprains is made by taking mung beans, labdanum, acacia, iris root, marshmallow, and sugar—ten dirhams each; myrrh and aloe—five dirhams each; tamarisk—twenty dirhams; and Armenian or Roman clay—twenty dirhams. All are pounded and mixed with tamarisk water or egg white if the patient’s temperament is warm, and then this dressing is applied. It is well-composed, quickly sets broken bones, and is suitable for most people due to its balance.
Another dressing also beneficial for fractures and sprains involves taking marshmallow, mung beans, and white hollyhock—ten dirhams each; myrrh and aloe—five dirhams each; acacia—six dirhams; Armenian clay—twenty dirhams. All are finely ground, sifted, kneaded with water or egg white, and then applied.
A dressing for joints and dislocated bones that relieves pain, fractures, and breaks involves taking washed wool, soaking it in vinegar and boiled oil, and placing it on the affected area. This dressing lacks the ability to set bones.
However, it excels in soothing hot swelling and relieving pain. Another dressing for setting broken bones involves taking fig leaves and wild poppy leaves, pounding them together, and applying them fresh. Another simplified dressing is used when the bone fracture is healing.
When you wish to dissolve the remaining swelling, take marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and chickpea flour—equal parts. Pound them all, knead them with ointment if the limb is not inflamed; if it is inflamed, knead them with coriander water or plain water, and then use it.
Another dressing, stronger in dissolving swelling than the first, is used when a hard swelling occurs during bone healing. Take marshmallow root, flaxseed, fenugreek, royal crown, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile—equal parts.
Pound all together and knead with willow water, pure water, or ointment, depending on the warmth of the limb and the degree of its calmness. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that anything should be applied to the broken limb during healing.
Except for cerate made only from wax and oil, which he described as having a consistency between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he recommended applying to the broken limb during healing substances that are drying with some warmth, such as myrrh, aloe, frankincense, and similar substances to what we mentioned.
A dressing beneficial for weakness and pain involves taking marshmallow, chickpeas, human hair clippings or bird feathers, and salt in equal parts, then pounding, sifting, kneading, and applying it. As for how long the bandage should remain.
Then it should be untied after observing the patient; if no pain, itching, or displacement of the broken bone occurs, do not untie it for many days. However, if severe itching, disturbing pain, or swelling occurs at the site.
Hasten to untie it immediately without delay, and remove the dressing. Then take a soft cloth or a moist sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the site until the itching and pain subside. Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Then apply washed wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and tie it on the site for a night until you are assured that the hot swelling has subsided, the swelling of the limb has calmed, and its pain has dissipated. Then reapply a gentle bandage and a light dressing, avoiding the tightness of the first application.
Be gentle until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, puffiness, and all symptoms have completely disappeared, and the dressing and binding are still needed, reapply them exactly as you did initially. If none of the symptoms we mentioned occur in the limb.
Then do not untie it except after three, four, five, or seven days, and it may even be left for twenty days. All of this depends on what the condition of the limb indicates to you, as we have said, until the fracture becomes stable and the flesh has nearly adhered to it.
Then, at that point, increase the tightness more than your initial binding, and also thicken the diet of the patient as previously mentioned. If you notice that the site of the fracture has dried and withered more than it should, realize that nourishment is not reaching it.
Moisten it with lukewarm water each time you loosen it, which should be every three days, and ease the tightness slightly. By doing this, nourishment will flow to the limb, and it will heal quickly. As for what the ignorant bone-setters do—breaking the limb again.
If it does not initially heal properly and heals crookedly, this action of theirs is a mistake and a grave danger. If it were correct, the predecessors would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it. I have not seen any trace of it among them. The correct approach is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
On fractures occurring in the head.
The types of fractures occurring in the head are many, their forms varied, and their causes diverse. Among the fractures is one caused by a sword blow, which may either shave the entire bone down to the membrane beneath it. As an adze cuts into wood.
This type of fracture is therefore called "adze-like." Alternatively, a sword may cut part of the bone and shave only its surface without penetrating fully, and this type of fracture is called "simple extraction." The wounds from these fractures may be either large or small.
Another type of fracture involves crushing or bruising, caused by a blow from a stone or a fall onto a rock or similar object. This fracture may either penetrate near the membrane beneath the bone or remain on the bone's surface.
The wounds from these two fractures may also be either large or small. Another type of fracture is hidden in the bone and as thin as a hairline, being a slight crack.
This type of fracture is therefore called "hairline." Another type results from a fall or the impact of a stone or similar object, causing the bone's surface to depress inward, as happens to a copper pot struck by a blow, creating an inward dent.
This most often occurs in soft-boned heads, such as those of children. All these types of fractures may have detached or non-detached fragments, and we will discuss the treatment for all of them in its place. We diagnose all these types of fractures by examining them.
Probing with instruments and removing any decayed flesh from the surface are part of the diagnosis. As for the hairline type, it is identified by uncovering the bone, wiping it, and staining it with ink; the fracture appears black. Regarding treatment, first observe the patient’s symptoms.
If you see symptoms indicating severe danger, such as bilious vomiting, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging and reddened eyes, or similar signs, do not approach or treat the patient. Death is inevitable in most cases with such symptoms.
If you observe symptoms that do not alarm you and you have hope for recovery, then proceed with treatment. If the injured person comes to you shortly after being wounded, and it is during the winter.
You must strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case. If it is summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day to prevent the membrane beneath the bone from decaying, which would lead to the symptoms we described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and involves crushing and bruising, you must remove the crushed and bruised part in the manner I will describe to you. First, shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in whatever way is feasible for you, based on the shape of the wound and what will cause the least discomfort to the patient. If bleeding or hot swelling appears while exposing the bone, treat it appropriately.
This involves packing the area with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and cleaning the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then proceed to carve out and remove the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.
One method is to cut the bone using a fine instrument with a narrow blade, which is shaped as follows:.
Then, use another instrument after this one, slightly wider, which is shaped as follows:.
Next, use another instrument even wider than the second. It is essential to have several cutting tools of varying widths and lengths, with their edges extremely sharp, made from Indian steel or high-quality iron.
Apply gentle force when striking the instrument to avoid shaking and harming the head. If the bone is strong and solid, you should drill around it before using the cutting tools, with drills known as "non-penetrating drills."
These are called non-penetrating drills because they do not go beyond the thickness of the cranial bone. This is due to a rounded edge below the sharp tip, resembling a collar or small circle, which prevents it from sinking deeper.
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of the bone in question. Each cranial bone requires a drill with a tip length precisely matching its thickness, whether long or short. Here are illustrations of three types:. Of drills: large, medium, and small:.
As for the method of drilling around the broken bone, it is to place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then move the drill to another place and leave the distance between each hole about the thickness of the awl or similar.
Then cut between each two holes with the cutters, doing this as gently as possible as we said, until you remove the bone either by hand or with another tool that you have prepared for this.
Such as the forceps and fine hooks, and you should be very careful not to let the drill or cutter touch the membrane. When you have hollowed out the bone and separated it from the membrane if it was attached to it and removed it, you should clean.
And smooth the roughness that remains in the bone with another tool similar to the cutter but it should be thinner and finer than the other cutters. If there are any small bones or splinters left, gently remove them with the tools you have.
Then treat the wound with swabs and ointments that will be mentioned later. As for the other method, it is very easy and free from risk. Galen mentioned it and praised it greatly, and this is what he said. You should first begin by exposing a part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and prominent. When you have exposed that part, place the end of this lenticular cutter underneath it, and this is its shape:
The lenticular part of it is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part of it is along its longitudinal sides as you see, so that the lenticular part rests on the membrane and the sharp face of the cutter is on the bone. Then strike the cutter from one side.
With a small hammer until you cut through all the bone gently in a circular motion, and you are safe from damaging the membrane; nothing frightening happens at all, even if the practitioner is the most ignorant and cowardly person, yes, even if he is sleepy.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some places, scrape it off with the end of the lenticular cutter itself and gently separate it; it will be separated without harm or fear.
As for if the bone fracture did not reach the membrane and the broken part of the bone is its surface with roughness and fine splinters remaining, you should clean that roughness and remove those splinters with fine scrapers made in different sizes so that you can use the most suitable one for each place according to what the work requires.
And the broken bone itself and its shape, you should use the widest of those scrapers first in your cleaning of the bone, then use the finer one after it, and keep doing that continuously until you reach using the finest and thinnest of all.
As for the other small hairline cracks and fine fractures, you should treat each one according to what leads to its healing, which is something not hidden to anyone with the slightest experience in this craft who has read and understood what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the wound opening, then take another cloth folded or triangular. And dip it in wine and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, doing this as lightly as possible so as not to weigh down the membrane, then apply a wide bandage over it and do not tighten it except just enough to hold the wound.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from hot swelling, then remove it and use medicines that have a drying effect such as iris roots, chickpea flour, frankincense powder, aristolochia, and the like. Make a powder from these medicines.
And sprinkle it on the wound as it is dry, and in general, use a medicine that cleans without stinging. Strive as much as you can during the treatment of the wound to keep it clean, without any greasy residue or dirt, and do not let pus accumulate in it at all.
Because if pus accumulates on the brain membrane, it will spoil and rot it, causing great harm to the patient. Blackening may occur on the surface of the head membrane when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
A blackening on its surface appears; if the symptoms we mentioned occur to the patient, know that he is doomed without doubt. But if the blackening happened due to a medicine applied to it and the potency of that medicine caused this blackening.
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well, and smear them on a cloth. Then place it on the membrane and treat it with the appropriate methods until it heals.
The third chapter.
On setting the nose when it is broken.
Know that only the two upper parts of the nose, or one of them, break because they are bones. The lower part is cartilaginous and does not break; rather, it suffers from bruising, bending, and flattening.
If one side of it breaks, you should insert the little finger into the nostril and straighten the fracture from the inside using your index finger and thumb from the outside until you return the nose to its natural shape. Do this gently, ensuring that you do not cause the patient pain with your action.
If the fracture is at the upper part of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, it should be adjusted with the tip of a slightly thick probe. If the fracture is on both sides, do the same, and the correction should be done on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling has subsided, insert a wick made of linen cloth into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or insert two wicks if the fracture is on both sides.
The wicks should be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some early practitioners suggested soaking the wicks in fat and changing them daily, but I do not agree with this. Instead, the wicks should be soaked in egg whites mixed with millstone dust.
Then leave the wicks in place until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens. You may also insert goose feather tubes wrapped in soft cloth into the nostril in place of the wicks, as they hold the nasal fracture more firmly and allow the patient to breathe.
This is not strictly necessary—you can either use the wicks or the tubes. If during treatment the nose develops a hot swelling, bandage it with cerate, or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or something from the diachylon ointment.
If no hot swelling occurs, bandage the nose externally with a paste made of semolina flour and finely powdered frankincense mixed with egg whites. Then place a soft piece of flax on it and do not tie the nose with anything at all. If the nasal bones are fractured into small pieces...
...or have splintered, you should make an incision over them, remove the fragments with the appropriate instrument, suture the incision, and treat it with ointments that aid in adhesion and healing. If a wound occurs inside the nose, treat it with wicks and use lead tubes. ...until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On setting the lower jaw when it is fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured but without a wound, examine it. If the fracture is external only, without breaking into two or inward bending, it is easy to diagnose.
If the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand. Use it to gently lift the protrusion of the fracture outward from within.
Your other hand, placed externally on the bone, adjusts its alignment. If the jaw fracture has split into two, apply traction from both sides in a straight line until proper alignment is achieved. If the teeth have become loose or spaced apart...
...tie the ones you hope to save with gold, silver, or silk thread. Then apply cerate to the fractured jaw, cover it with a folded cloth, and place a large, firm splint or a piece of leather shaped to match the jaw's length on top. Then bind it from above in a way that suits the fixation and ensures it remains stable. Instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and provide them with soft soups as nourishment. If you suspect that the alignment has changed in any way, remove the binding on the third day and readjust.
Then bind it from above in a way that suits the fixation and ensures it remains stable. Instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and provide them with soft soups as nourishment. If you suspect that the alignment has changed in any way, remove the binding on the third day and readjust. Then repair the dressing using millstone dust mixed with egg whites or semolina flour after removing the cerate. Place a soft piece of flax on the dressing, and as long as it adheres and the bone remains stable, leave it in place.
Do not remove it until the fracture has healed and strengthened, which often occurs within three weeks. If a hot swelling arises during this time, use the treatments mentioned earlier to alleviate it until the swelling subsides.
However, if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, examine it. If a splinter or splinters of bone have detached, carefully remove them using the appropriate instrument. If the wound's opening is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as needed.
After removing all the splinters, if no fragments remain, suture the wound if it is wide. Otherwise, apply a suitable ointment to it. Allow the wound to adhere and heal.
Chapter Five.
On setting the clavicle when it is fractured.
The clavicle most commonly fractures in the front near the shoulder's end. Such fractures occur in one of three ways: either the bone breaks into two without producing splinters, which is the easiest type to set...
...or splinters are produced, which is harder to set, or the fracture occurs with a wound. If the fracture is without a wound, prepare two assistants: one to secure the arm adjacent to the broken clavicle, and the other to extend the neck toward the opposite side.
Then align the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct, without any protrusions or indentations. If more extension is needed, place a ball made of cloth or wool under the patient’s armpit.
The ball’s size should match your need. Extend and lift the clavicle while pressing the ball with your hand to align the fracture properly. If you cannot draw the end of the clavicle outward because it has sunk inward, the patient should lie on their back.
Place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and have the assistant press the shoulder downward until the clavicle that has sunk inward rises upward. At this point, correct the fracture and align it with your fingers.
If you sense that a splinter of the clavicle has broken off and is moving, you should make an incision and gently extract that splinter. If the splinter is embedded in the bone, carefully cut it with one of the tools prepared for this purpose. Place beneath the clavicle the instrument designed to protect the periosteum; this instrument may be made of wood or iron, and it is shaped as follows:
It resembles a spoon without any concavity, with its width depending on the size of the bone, whether large or small. The length should also be suitable for your needs in the operation. It should have two ends, as shown: one wider and the other narrower.
If the wound opening created during the extraction of the bone splinter is wide and you do not expect hot swelling, suture the wound's edges. If the opening is small or you fear swelling, pack the wound with cloth and padding proportional to its size.
If hot swelling occurs, moisten the cloth with rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it to the wound. If there is no wound or incision, secure the bone with a dressing made from millstone dust mixed with egg whites. Place soft flax over it, and if needed, position a ball under the patient’s armpit. Then take a very long bandage, about a handspan in width, and place a folded pad over the flax and dressing. Next, take a splint made of a thin plank. The splint should be three fingers wide and of equivalent length. Wrap it in cloth, and then place it, along with the cloth, in the section of the bandage covering the fracture site. Bind the bandage tightly around the fracture in a circular fashion. Pass the bandage over the neck, under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit, repeating this on all sides until you achieve a secure fixation of the fracture, as you will recognize.
The goal in all of this is to ensure that the splint does not shift from the broken bone. For this reason, you should inspect the patient daily. If the binding loosens and you see the splint has shifted, correct it and tighten the bandage. Position the patient to sleep on their back, placing a small cushion under their armpit at night.
This raises their upper arm from their side, lifting the clavicle fracture along with the shoulder. Alternatively, tie the arm to the neck. Do not remove the binding unless there is itching or swelling in the area for up to twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if necessary. Reapply the binding and leave it in place until the clavicle fracture heals, consolidates, and strengthens, which typically takes about twenty-eight days. For some individuals, it may take less time.
Chapter Six.
On setting a fracture of the shoulder. The shoulder rarely breaks in its broad area, but its edges are prone to breaking. If a part breaks or if the middle is fractured, this can only be detected by touch, and the treatment depends on the nature of the fracture.
Straighten it and restore it to its natural shape by whatever method you can. Then apply to the area ground millstone dust mixed with egg white and soft cotton, place a folded cloth pad on top, and secure it with a wide splint made from a thin wooden plank.
The splint should be thin, matching the size of the entire shoulder or slightly larger. If there is a depression beneath the splint at any part of the shoulder, fill that depression with soft cotton so that the splint rests evenly, and then tie it tightly with a long cloth.
Tie it firmly and ensure that the splint does not move from its position. Check the bandage daily, and whenever it loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has shifted. The patient should lie on their uninjured side, and the shoulder will heal in twenty.
...days or twenty-five days. Once this period is complete, remove the bandage safely, as the shoulder bone is one that does not generally crumble or relapse. If a bone fragment protrudes and irritates the skin, incise the area and extract it. Follow the same procedure described for a clavicle fracture to alleviate any hot swelling if it occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On setting a fracture of the chest.
The chest can fracture in its center, though this is rare. The edges, however, are more prone to breaking and splintering. Symptoms of a central chest fracture include sagging downward, severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing.
Blood may sometimes be expelled, and a depression in the fractured bone becomes evident to touch. To set it, the patient should lie on their back with a cushion placed between their shoulders, while the shoulders are pressed, and the ribs are brought together with the hands on both sides, carefully straightening the area in any feasible way.
Adjust until the bone’s shape is restored to its proper form. Then apply a bandage and cotton to the area, followed by a splint made from a light plank of willow, boxwood, or similar material, after wrapping it in cloth. Gently tie the splint over the fractured bone to ensure it does not shift. Wrap the bandage in a circular manner around the back several times and tighten it securely. Regularly check the bandage and tighten it whenever it loosens.
If necessary to loosen it due to irritation, pain, or swelling at the site, immediately remove the bandage, address the issue with appropriate treatment, and then reapply the bandage if deemed suitable. Ensure it is securely tied until healing is complete.
Chapter Eight.
On setting fractures of the ribs. Know that fractures in the ribs usually occur in the thick areas near the back, while their anterior edges tend to suffer bruises due to their cartilaginous nature. Such conditions are easily detected by touch during examination with the fingers.
To set a rib fracture, align the break with your fingers as carefully as possible until its shape is restored to what it should be. Then apply a dressing and secure the fractured bone with a splint if necessary. If the rib fracture is inwardly displaced, the patient will experience severe pain.
The pain will resemble the stabbing sensation associated with colic because the bone irritates the diaphragm. This condition also causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and significant blood expulsion, making it challenging to treat. The ancients devised various methods to address it.
Some suggested giving the patient foods that produce bloating and gas to inflate the abdomen, stretch it, and push the fracture outward. However, we disapprove of this as it may provoke or exacerbate a hot swelling if it has not already occurred or worsen it if it has.
Others recommended applying a cupping glass to the area and sucking forcefully. This method seems rational, but there is concern that the cupping may draw unwanted fluids to the weakened area. Some also suggested covering the site with wool soaked in hot oil.
A pad is placed between the ribs to fill the gaps so that the bandage, when wrapped around circularly, lies evenly. The patient is then treated with the diet and medication prescribed for colic. If the patient is overwhelmed by unbearable symptoms... ...and the bone causes painful irritation to the diaphragm, posing a danger to the patient, the area should be incised, exposing the fractured rib. Then, the tool previously described for protecting the peritoneum is placed beneath, and the bone is carefully cut and removed.
The edges of the wound are then sutured if large and treated with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling arises during this time, immediately moisten pads with rose oil, place them on the site, and also treat the patient with internal remedies to reduce the swelling.
The patient should lie on the side that is more comfortable for sleeping until recovery is complete.
Chapter Nine.
On setting fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, fractures rarely occur in them; they are more often contused, and the same applies to the vertebrae of the back. If such an injury happens, and you wish to know whether recovery is possible or not... ...observe whether the patient’s hands have become limp, numb, and lifeless, and if they cannot move, extend, or grip. If pricked with a needle or pinched, they feel nothing and experience no pain. In most such cases, know that recovery is not possible, and the patient is doomed.
However, if the patient can move their hands and feels pinching or pricking sensations, the spinal cord is intact, and the patient can recover with treatment. If the vertebrae of the back sustain such an injury, and you wish to determine whether recovery is possible...
...observe the legs. If they too become limp and exhibit the same symptoms as the hands, and if lying on the back causes involuntary expulsion of gas and feces or lying on the stomach causes involuntary urination... ...and the patient cannot urinate even when attempting to do so on their back, know that they are doomed, and there is no point in treating them. If none of these occur, the condition is less severe, and treatment should focus on alleviating the hot swelling.
Apply rose oil alone or mixed with roasted egg yolks to the injured vertebrae three times daily until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply a firming and drying dressing, secure it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to remain still and at rest.
The patient should sleep only on the side that does not cause pain until recovery. If a fragment of bone or debris has detached due to the contusion, the skin should be incised, and the bone removed. The wound edges should then be sutured if large and treated with healing ointments until recovery. If the last bone of the coccyx, the tailbone, is fractured, insert the thumb of the left hand into the rectum.
With the other hand, adjust the fractured bone as much as possible, ensuring proper alignment. Then apply a dressing and a splint if needed and secure it tightly.
If you detect a broken fragment, incise the area, remove it, and treat the wound with the methods previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On setting fractures of the hip.
Hip bones rarely fracture, but when they do, the fracture often involves shattering at the ends, splitting lengthwise, and tilting inward. This causes the patient pain at the site, pricking sensations, and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.
To set the fracture, feel the area with your hand to determine the shape of the break. If the fracture is only at the ends, align it as best as possible so that it resembles its natural form.
If the fracture runs lengthwise or has tilted inward, lay the patient on their stomach to facilitate setting the break. Once it is aligned, apply a dressing, then place a splint of wood or leather over it, and bind it tightly.
Ensure that the fracture does not shift and the splint does not move. Level any depressions in the flanks with padding so that the binding is evenly distributed. Instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side. If a hot swelling occurs...
...refrain from stretching or setting the fracture until the swelling subsides. Apply remedies to alleviate the swelling as previously described, then return to setting and binding the fracture properly. If bone fragments or shattered pieces are present at the ends, they should not be removed.
They should not be touched but aligned from the outside, as mentioned earlier, and the binding left in place until healing occurs.
Chapter Eleven.
On setting fractures of the upper arm.
The upper arm extends from the elbow to the shoulder. If it is fractured, it can be set in one of two ways: the first is to take a smooth, moderately thick, curved stick shaped like this:
Attach bands to both ends of the stick, suspend it from a high place, and have the patient sit on a chair. Place the fractured arm on the stick so that the armpit rests in the center of the curve. Then hang a weight from above.
Alternatively, an assistant can pull the arm downward while the physician uses both hands to align the fracture properly. The second method involves having the patient lie on their back while the arm is suspended from the neck by a band.
Then instruct two assistants: one to hold above the fracture with their hands, and the other to hold below it, each pulling in opposite directions. For greater traction, wrap a band below and above the fracture and have each assistant pull these bands in their respective directions.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, the middle of the bandage should be placed under the armpit, and the other part under the fracture near the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, the bandage should be placed on that location and on the elbow itself.
Then gently align the fracture without force until the fracture is properly aligned and fits well. Then secure it unless there is an occurrence of a hot swelling; if such swelling appears, delay the securing until the seventh day and place on it a moistened wool pad soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Once the swelling has subsided, then secure it. The method of securing it is to apply the dressing to the fracture, then wrap a bandage of new cloth over the dressing, then fold the arm over itself with the hand open and placed on the shoulder.
The cloth and securing should be supported by the upper arm and forearm, so the forearm acts as splints unless prevented by an obstacle or if the fractured bone changes position. If you fear such changes, use splints.
This involves placing a splint on the fracture itself, which should be wider and stronger than other splints, with a finger-width space between each splint. The length of the splints should correspond to the fracture, extending three fingers’ width beyond it on each side.
Then secure the splints with the binding method described at the beginning of the chapter.
The securing at the fracture site should be the tightest.
The farther from the fracture, the less tight the securing should be. If you find it appropriate to apply the splints and secure them as described while setting the limb immediately, then do so.
If you fear hot swelling, delay securing and applying the splints until the seventh day, as mentioned. Then inspect the bandage every three days to prevent itching, swelling, or obstruction of nourishment to the limb caused by excessive tightness, correcting all such issues as described.
If you are confident that none of these issues will occur, do not remove the bandage for many days. The patient should lie on their back, with their hand placed on their stomach, and a padded support filled with evenly distributed wool placed under the upper arm.
Regularly inspect the fracture at all times, day or night, to ensure the shape of the broken limb remains stable and the bandage does not loosen. Correct all issues diligently, and ensure the patient’s diet follows the prescribed order: light food initially until the bone begins to strengthen.
Then the diet should become more substantial. Typically, the upper arm and leg bones heal within forty days, after which the bandage can be removed, the bath used, and ointments appropriate for the condition applied. If the fracture is severe and comminuted.
Do not remove the bandage for fifty days or even two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On Setting a Fractured Forearm.
The forearm is composed of two bones called the ulnae, one smaller, which is adjacent to the thumb, and the other larger, situated below the smaller bone. Sometimes the larger bone alone fractures, or the smaller one alone, or sometimes both fracture together.
If the smaller upper ulna is fractured, setting it is easier, and its healing is faster. If the lower ulna is fractured, the fracture is worse, and healing is more difficult, with the worst case being when both bones are fractured together. If the fracture involves the smaller upper ulna.
The physician, when setting it, should gently and slightly extend it to align it properly. If the larger ulna is fractured, the extension should be stronger, and if both bones are fractured, the extension should be much stronger.
The hand should be positioned during the setting and extension, extended on a cushion with the thumb raised higher than all other fingers, and the little finger lower than the rest of the fingers. The patient should be seated cross-legged.
The cushion should be level with the patient to avoid causing the patient undue strain.
Then one assistant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, while another assistant extends from above. The physician then aligns the bone to the best shape possible. If there are bone fragments in the fracture, they should be.
Attempt to return each fragment to its place as much as possible. If a detached fragment protrudes, piercing the skin, and cannot be set, incise the area and remove it as previously described. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate chapter is dedicated to its treatment.
Refer to that section for treatment. If hot swelling occurs early in the setting process, apply a cloth soaked in a mixture of rose oil and white wax, prepared with moderate thickness, and secure it gently until the swelling subsides.
Remove the mixture and apply a dressing made of millstone dust mixed with egg whites, then affix the splints. The splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly wider and stronger. Note that the forearm typically requires six splints in most cases.
This applies whether the fracture involves one ulna or both. Make the securing at the fracture site the strongest and tightest, loosening slightly as you wrap upward or downward, as previously explained at the beginning of the chapter.
The cloth used to wrap the fracture should be soft and moist, not excessively stiff, and the thread used to secure it should be made specifically of medium-weight linen, as described. Inspect the limb and the bandage after a few days.
If an issue arises, such as itching in the limb, the limb should be washed with warm water until the itching subsides, and the limb should be left unbound for a night to rest before reapplying the bandage.
If the bandage has loosened, or the bone has shifted, or similar issues arise, rectify these problems to the best of your ability. Also, if blood flow to the limb is obstructed due to excessive tightness, the bandage should be loosened slightly and left for a few days to allow circulation before tightening it again.
If the patient does not experience any of the aforementioned issues, the bandage should not be removed until about twenty days have passed. The patient’s hand should then be suspended around their neck, keeping the arm straight. The patient should avoid sudden movements and sleep on their back.
Be aware that this type of arm fracture usually heals in thirty or thirty-two days, though it may sometimes heal in twenty-eight days, depending on the temperament and strength of the patient.
Chapter Thirteen.
On Setting Fractures of the Hand and Fingers.
Fractures of the metacarpal bones and phalanges of the fingers are rare, though they are often subject to bruising. If the hand suffers a fracture or a bruise.
The patient should sit cross-legged with a level chair in front of them.
They should place their extended hand on the chair while an assistant stretches the broken bones, and the physician aligns them until they are properly set. At this point, a bandage and cotton should be applied unless there is hot swelling, after which a splint should be placed on top, adjusted to the size of the fracture.
Wrap the splint in soft cloth. If the fracture is downward toward the palm, make a ball-shaped object from cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with their fractured hand, then secure it with a long bandage.
The splint should be made of soft leather to conform to the skin and allow for the bending of the entire hand, securing it appropriately. If the fracture is outward, place a splint on top and another underneath the hand to keep the hand open and upright.
The bandage should be wrapped around the hand as it rotates, interweaving between the fingers with the bandage. If a fracture occurs in one of the phalanges of the fingers, such as the thumb, it should be aligned properly, then secured with the hand. If you prefer, you may apply a small upright splint to stabilize the fracture.
Ensure it does not move. For fractures in other fingers, such as the middle, index, pinky, or ring finger, align them and bind the fractured finger to the adjacent healthy one, or secure all fingers together in succession, which is more effective. Alternatively, you may place a small upright splint on the affected finger.
As mentioned regarding the thumb, inspect during and after the setting of the fracture for hot swelling, and treat it appropriately if it occurs, as described repeatedly.
Chapter Fourteen.
On Setting a Fracture of the Thigh.
The thigh bone frequently fractures and can be recognized by touch as it shifts forward and backward. Its treatment involves tying a bandage above the fracture and another below it, with the patient lying face down.
Then, an assistant stretches each bandage in its respective direction evenly. This applies if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. However, if it is near the base of the thigh, a soft bandage, such as one made of wool, should be tied.
The bandage should be placed near the base of the thigh, toward the groin, to allow upward traction, with the other bandage below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be placed near the knee for downward traction. The physician should then adjust the bone with both hands until it is restored to its natural shape.
Once the bone aligns properly, apply the bandage and binding, provided there is no hot swelling. If swelling occurs, delay the binding for a few days until the swelling subsides, and then proceed with the treatment.
For binding, wrap a firm, wide cloth bandage around the fracture two or three times, leaving the ends loose. Then, bend the leg so the heel rests at the base of the buttock. Insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the lower part of the knee, leaving the thread ends extending upward on both sides.
Wrap the remaining cloth around the leg and thigh, then place splints on the thigh at the fracture site, and one splint on the shin bone. Fill any gaps between the thigh and the shin with soft cloth to ensure even binding.
Then begin with a strong binding from the middle over the site of the fracture, three or four turns, and as you move away from the site of the fracture with the bandage, let your binding be less tight, softer, and looser.
Then take the two ends of the thread that you had placed between the thigh and the leg, and tie with them the splints above. Then pass the two ends of the thread downward until you reach the heel of the foot, and also tie with them the ends of the splints on the opposite side.
So that the bandage does not move from its place, and then you leave it bound as long as no ulceration, swelling, bloating, or the like occurs in the limb. If any of that occurs, quickly loosen it and correct everything that has happened as we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a splinter in the bone causing discomfort, you should smooth it if you can, and if not, incise it, extract it, and treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This fracture of the thigh may be bound without adding the leg to it with splints.
As we mentioned with the upper arm and forearm, except that binding it this way does not result in limping for the patient, whereas if the thigh is bound alone without including the leg, the patient will inevitably limp permanently.
And know that the thigh heals in fifty days, or a little more or less, depending on the variations in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the Fracture of the Kneecap.
The kneecap is rarely subject to fracture, though it is often bruised. If it does fracture, it is either a crack or a fragmentation of its parts, and this may occur with or without a wound.
You determine all this by feel, and treat it by aligning the separated parts with the fingers until they come together and cohere, to the extent possible with adjustment, care, and precision. Then apply the bandage and a rounded splint on it if needed.
Bind it from above with appropriate tension, and then monitor all conditions described for other fractures, such as hot swelling and the like, by treating each symptom with what is suitable until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On Setting the Fracture of the Leg.
The leg has two bones: one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula. They are subject to the same types of fractures as the two bones of the forearm. Thus, setting it is the same as setting the forearm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are broken, the leg turns in all directions; if the thinner bone is broken, the leg bends forward; and if the thicker bone is broken and this occurs at the bottom, it is something that will not escape your notice.
Apply traction and alignment, and bind the splints accordingly. However, if the fracture of the leg is severe with many splinters, the traction should be less and lighter, and you should be as gentle as possible in setting it.
In treating the leg, there is an additional step compared to the forearm: after you have aligned the splints and completed all the work, take two strips of pine wood used in leveling ceilings, placed between the grooves of planks, or from palm fronds or similar materials.
Choose pieces that are slightly thick and not too thin, and let their length match the leg from the knee to the bottom. Then wrap each piece with cloth two times along its length, placing one on the inner side of the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let them extend from the knee to the sole of the foot. Then tie the two strips in three places: at the ends and the middle. This binding prevents the leg from leaning to the right or left and ensures proper alignment. A wooden channel may also be used along the length of the leg.
It is placed to prevent movement, and this should especially be done for fractures accompanied by wounds. Then examine the leg daily, giving it great care, looking for swelling, bloating, or other symptoms. If any such symptoms appear, treat them appropriately until they heal. The bone of the leg usually heals in about thirty days.
Chapter Seventeen.
On Fractures of the Bones of the Foot and Toes.
The heel is never subject to fracture at all. As for the bones of the foot, they may suffer fractures, while the toes rarely experience fractures, as they are mostly prone to bruises.
If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and you see those bones overlapping one another, have the patient place their foot upright on the ground as if walking. Then place your own foot on the elevated part of the bones, press them down, and straighten them.
Until they return to their places. Then apply the bandage and soft material on top, and place beneath the sole of the foot a small board with two flat ends. Secure the foot tightly with it after wrapping it with cloth and all necessary materials.
After three or four days, loosen the bandage, and you will find the bones aligned, whether they were broken or dislocated. The procedure is as you see. As for a fractured toe, set it and align it as I described for setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken finger along its length, and let it be slightly wider than the finger. Then place beneath the foot the board I described to you, and fasten it tightly. If two, three, or more bones are broken.
Then place a splint of appropriate size on each finger, wrapped in a soft cloth, and fasten the board beneath the foot. Let each end of the board extend beyond the sole of the foot to secure it firmly.
You should not forget to review all the symptoms we have described for fractures and address each symptom with the appropriate remedy.
The Eighteenth Chapter.
On Fracture of the Woman’s Pubic Bone, the Pubic Bone, and the Male Organ.
When a woman’s pubic region is fractured, seat her cross-legged, then bend her slightly backward. Let her be supported from behind, while the midwife fills her pubic area with cotton until it is full and forms a ball-like shape.
Then shake the woman gently, raising her pelvis slightly. The cotton will then emerge to the vaginal opening in a ball-like form, restoring the fractured bone. Place a bandage on her back, and whenever she needs to urinate, remove the cotton gently to allow her to do so.
Replace the cotton in the same manner as initially inserted, and return to the first bandage. Repeat this for seven days or so until it heals. Alternatively, you may take a sheep's bladder, tie a reed tube to its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then blow forcefully into the tube so that the bladder inflates inside the vagina, and the fracture will realign. Fill it with cotton and maintain the treatment for several days as described until healing occurs. As for fractures of the pubic bone in men or women, treat them.
With the same method we described for the hip bone. The correct approach for these rare fractures, which seldom occur, is not hidden from one with some expertise and understanding of this book, for the fracture itself often guides you to the proper treatment.
Towards the proper way to align and secure it. Understand this. As for the male organ when fractured, take a goose’s trachea, insert the organ into it, then wrap it with a cloth bandage, bind it, and leave it for about three days until it heals.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
On Setting Bone Fractures When They Are Accompanied by Wounds.
One who encounters a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large like the femur or humerus or similar, should immediately perform venesection if the conditions for venesection, as previously described, allow it.
If the wound is bleeding profusely, you should hasten to stop it by sprinkling powdered alum over it if nothing else is available. Then proceed to set the fracture on the same day without delay.
Provided no hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does arise, postpone setting the fracture until the ninth day, allowing the swelling to subside. Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, as this could result in harmful complications.
If the broken bone protrudes through the skin and is exposed, you should attempt to realign and straighten it gently with your hands and slight traction. If manual realignment is not possible, use this instrument, which is made of iron, about seven or eight fingers in length. Its width should correspond to that of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should prepare three or four of these instruments, as needed for treating various types of fractures. Let them be rounded and slightly thick to prevent them from bending under pressure during the procedure.
They should have a sharp end with a hooked tip, with the upper part being thicker and tapering very thinly from the middle downwards. This is their design:
It is called berem in Greek, meaning "a small lever." Place its hooked sharp end on the protruding edge of the bone and press it firmly until the bone returns and partially realigns. Then proceed to align the fractured edges with one another.
If the fractured edge is too thin and the instrument does not grip it well, cut off the thin edge of the bone to enable the instrument to hold it. If you are still unable to realign the bone as described, sever it with a cutting tool like those mentioned earlier.
Or saw it with one of the saws as best as you can. Then smooth out the remaining roughness or thin flakes from the bone. If, after aligning the bone, the patient experiences severe and bothersome pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can return it to its natural position, do so, as it will greatly benefit the patient. Once the fracture is set, soak a cloth in astringent black wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place resin or anything oily on the wound.
This is to prevent rot and infection. Then use splints as soon as you finish setting the bone, leaving the wound exposed by cutting a hole in the bandage with scissors to fit the wound.
Be extremely cautious not to tighten the wound dressing along with the fracture splint. Ignorant physicians have often caused either death or ulceration or sepsis in their patients by doing so. Let your bandaging be loose and relaxed, differing from the tighter binding for other fractures.
If the wound is severe or large and you fear the adverse effects we have described, and the patient experiences distressing pain in the area, you should not apply splints to it. Instead, use firm cloth bandages in place of splints and bind it with them.
If after a day or two you notice that pus is forming in the wound, remove the cloth soaked in wine that you had applied, and then use wick dressings and ointments traditionally used for wounds, such as the Quadruple Ointment or similar. You should also loosen the bandage.
Inspect the wound daily, in the evening and morning, until it heals. The affected limb should be positioned in a way that allows pus to drain downward easily. If many days pass and the wound does not close, and the pus persists, be aware that there may be small bone fragments present.
You should examine the wound with a probe. Remove and extract any detached bone fragments. For those that remain embedded and cause pain by pressing on the tissue, work diligently to cut and extract them by whatever means you can.
If the wound develops infection, gangrene, or any other form of decay or putrefaction, you must address each condition with the appropriate treatment as previously described in its section.
You should heed my words and remember that if a large bone, such as the femur or humerus, fractures and protrudes through the skin, do not attempt to pull it out or extract it. Such actions often lead to death. Instead, leave it until it decays, as it may naturally detach on its own after twenty or thirty days.
At that time, treat the wound if it appears amenable to treatment; otherwise, leave it as it is.
Chapter Twenty: On the treatment of the complications that occur after some fractures.
On the treatment of complications that appear as a result of certain fractures.
These complications often occur after the healing of a fracture, especially near the joints, leading to deformity of the limb and sometimes preventing the limb from performing its natural function.
If you observe that the complication is soft, use astringent medicines such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, tragacanth, acacia, and similar substances by taking some or all of these and mixing them with an astringent liquid, egg whites, or vinegar.
Apply this mixture to the complication using a piece of fabric, bind it tightly, and leave it bound for many days without loosening it, then replace it repeatedly until the complication disappears, God willing, or bind it with a well-fitted lead plate.
Lead has the property of eliminating any protrusions in the limbs. If the complication has hardened and intensified, and removing it becomes necessary, make an incision above it, cut away the protruding part, or scrape it off with certain instruments until it is removed, and then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One:
On the treatment of fractures that have healed but left the limb weak and unlike its original condition.
If a bone fracture heals and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, it is due to many reasons. One reason may be the frequent loosening and improper reapplication of the bindings, or excessively tight bindings that prevent nourishment from reaching the limb, or excessive and inappropriate movements at the wrong time, or a lack of blood in the patient’s body and their general weakness.
The treatment for this includes nourishing the patient and strengthening their body to increase blood flow, using the bath, bringing joy and happiness to them, and then applying pitch to the limb to draw nourishment or consistently bathing it with warm water. Until nourishment flows into it, and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-Two:
On the treatment of broken bones that heal crookedly and hinder their proper function.
If, after healing, a limb exhibits crookedness, protrusion of the broken bone, or complications, and the appearance of the limb becomes deformed. However, if the limb does not lose its natural function, one should not accept the claim of those who suggest breaking the bone from the beginning; many ignorant physicians and bone-setters in our region used to do this.
This action is highly reprehensible and leads to significant risks, the least of which is damage. But if the crookedness and complication are still soft, they should be bathed with water in which relaxing herbs, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, or other similar plants like crown daisy, have been boiled.
It should then be dressed with relaxing poultices such as properly made diachylon, or marshmallow root mucilage mixed with chicken fat and sesame oil, or a paste of fatty figs pounded with pigeon dung or other remedies known to dissolve adhesions.
The complication may be resolved through continuous and gentle manual massage, accompanied by moving the limb in all directions at all times. If the crookedness has become old, hardened, and calcified, and treatment with surgical tools becomes necessary.
The area should be incised above the deformity, the bone connection loosened, and any excess complication or bone removed with delicate tools, exercising utmost care and precision. Then the wound should be treated as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three:
Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its position, which impedes movement, deforms the limb, and causes the patient severe pain and distress. If dislocation occurs, it must be immediately corrected without delay.
It should never be delayed, as postponing will cause swelling, making it difficult to reduce the dislocation. Therefore, it should not be postponed, moved, or stretched during swelling, as this often leads to spasms and distressing pain for the patient.
If this occurs, the patient should undergo bloodletting, then left until the swelling subsides slightly, after which the affected area should be bathed with hot water and oil before gently correcting the dislocation. Each joint should be treated as described in its specific section.
The sections on dislocations are also arranged in order, starting from the upper body and proceeding downward, as previously done for fractures.
Chapter Twenty-Four:
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Dislocation of the jaws occurs rarely, and when it does, it takes one of two forms: either a slight displacement, causing minor loosening, or a complete and severe dislocation, causing extensive loosening. In the case of severe dislocation, the jaw may hang toward the chest, causing the patient to drool uncontrollably, making it impossible to close the jaw or speak clearly. A slight dislocation, however, often resolves itself with minimal intervention.
If the dislocation is complete, it must be promptly corrected without delay. This involves having an assistant hold the patient’s head while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand at the base of the dislocated jaw within the mouth if it is on one side.
Or the physician inserts both thumbs if the dislocation is on both sides, while the rest of the fingers are placed outside to steady the jaw. The patient is instructed to relax their jaw and allow it to move freely in all directions as the physician aligns and pushes the jaw until it returns to its proper position.
If it is difficult to reduce, especially when both jaws are dislocated, apply compresses of hot water and oil to ease their return and proceed without any delay, as previously stated. Once the jaws are realigned, stabilized, and the patient's mouth can close without slackness, apply cloth pads with an ointment made from wax, oil, and rose.
Then loosely bandage the area and instruct the patient to sleep on their back with their head supported between two cushions to prevent movement to the right or left. The patient should avoid chewing and consume only soft, liquid food.
Once the pain subsides and the jaw stabilizes, the patient may eat normally but should proceed gently, avoiding strain when opening the mouth for eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw heals completely.
If reducing the dislocation proves difficult and the jaws fail to return to their position, it often leads to fevers, persistent headaches, frequent diarrhea, or repeated vomiting of pure substances. If such symptoms appear, know that the prognosis is dire.
Many who experience such a condition die within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five:
On reducing the dislocation of the clavicle and the shoulder joint.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate inward due to its connection to the chest but may dislocate outward, which can be felt upon examination. To set it, the patient should lie on their back with their arms extended.
Then press the area firmly with your hand to reposition it. Afterward, apply a dressing and pads and secure them. As for the end of the clavicle connecting to the shoulder, dislocation is rare. If it occurs, it should be reduced and aligned as described or in whatever method is feasible.
Then apply a dressing, pads, and secure it with a bandage, instructing the patient to rest and remain still until recovery. The same treatment is used to reduce the dislocation of the shoulder joint if it is displaced.
Chapter Twenty-Six:
On reducing the dislocation of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder joint dislocates in three ways: downward toward the armpit, forward toward the chest, or, rarely, upward above the shoulder.
It does not dislocate backward due to the scapula or forward due to the nerves. Most commonly, it dislocates downward toward the armpit, especially in those with lean musculature, as it dislocates and reduces easily in them.
In contrast, those with ample musculature experience difficulty in both dislocation and reduction. Sometimes, an impact or fall causes the shoulder to swell with a hot inflammation, which may be mistaken for dislocation. In such cases, examination is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
At that point, proceed with treatment. A dislocation downward toward the armpit can be identified by comparing the dislocated shoulder with the healthy one; a noticeable difference is observed. The head of the dislocated shoulder feels depressed, and under the armpit, upon palpation, the head of the shoulder appears like an egg.
The patient cannot raise their hand to their ear or perform all movements. Similarly, if the dislocation is toward the chest or upward, it is evident upon palpation and unmistakable.
This dislocation is easier to reduce if it is recent or if the patient is a child. To reduce it, an assistant raises the patient’s arm upward, while you place your thumbs under the armpit and push the joint upward with force to return it to its position, with the assistant continuing to lift and extend the arm upward.
Then lower the arm downward; the joint should return quickly. If it does not return with this method and the dislocation has persisted for many days, the patient should bathe in hot water and use a relaxing and softening poultice, such as one made by boiling marshmallow root, fenugreek, and melilot in water.
Next, have the patient lie on their back, and place a ball of wool, moderately firm, under their armpit. The physician then places their heel on the ball, holds the patient’s arm with their hand, and pulls it downward.
Push the ball with your foot; the joint should return to its place. Alternatively, you can use this method: have a taller person stand beside the patient and position their shoulder under the patient’s armpit, lifting the armpit upward until the patient is suspended in the air. Meanwhile, another assistant pulls the patient’s arm downward across their abdomen. If the patient is light, you may attach additional weight to them to add pressure; this will return the joint immediately. Another method may also be employed.
This involves fixing a long wooden staff in the ground, with a rounded top resembling the pestle of a mortar—neither too thick nor too thin. Place the staff under the patient’s armpit, cushioning the top with soft cloth, and have the patient stand aligned with the staff.
Extend the patient’s arm downward from the opposite side while also stretching their torso in the opposite direction forcefully; the joint should quickly return to its position. If reduction is still difficult using all these methods, apply this treatment: take a wooden piece about two cubits long. The piece should be four fingers wide and two fingers thick, with a rounded top to facilitate insertion into the depth of the armpit, as described.
Then wrap soft cloths around the rounded head so that the wood does not harm the patient, then place it under the armpit, and extend the entire arm and forearm downward on the wood, tying the wood to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then place the arm on a crossbar or horizontal support, extending the hand downward and leaving the rest of the body suspended from the other side, as this allows the joint to return immediately to its place. Once it has returned, place a moderately sized woolen ball under the armpit.
Then apply a prepared dressing made of millstone dust mixed with frankincense and egg white to the entire shoulder in a circular manner. Tie the ball tightly under the armpit and wrap the dressing over it, securing it with a bandage. Suspend the arm by hanging it from the neck.
Leave the arm immobilized for seven days, and ensure the patient’s food intake is minimal to strengthen the limb and speed up healing. After seven or five days, remove the binding and gradually train the limb with movement. If it remains stable and does not weaken, the patient has healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to moisture or another condition, it should be treated with cauterization using three heated rods as described in the section on cauterization. If after doing all this and removing the binding after seven days the joint does not stabilize...
...and you reapply the dressing and tighten it multiple times but it still fails to stabilize, drooping and loosening without the ability to raise it upwards, then know that the nerve at the head of the shoulder has either been severed, stretched, or weakened, and thus the joint will never stabilize in its place again.
As for the dislocation that occurs toward the chest, breast, or backward, it is treated by pressing and stretching with the hands until it returns to its place. All forms of binding and treatment should be employed until it heals. If, after healing, stiffness occurs in the limb and movement is delayed...
...the patient should use the bath frequently until the stiffness softens and the limb returns to its natural state.
The twenty-seventh chapter.
On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty. It can dislocate in all directions, particularly forward or backward. Its dislocation is not hidden from you, as it is visible to the eye and palpable, regardless of the shape of its dislocation.
When you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, the dislocation becomes apparent through the concavity of the joint. The arm cannot bend nor can it touch the shoulder. You must act quickly to return the dislocation immediately before swelling and inflammation occur.
If hot swelling occurs, it becomes difficult to return, and it may never heal, especially if the dislocation is backward. This is the worst of all types of dislocations, the most painful, and often leads to death.
To treat it, if it can be returned, an assistant should stretch the arm with both hands while the forearm remains extended. The physician places one hand above and one below the elbow and pushes the joint back into place using both thumbs or the base of the palm.
If the dislocation is forward, it can sometimes be reduced by bending the arm forcefully so that the base of the hand strikes the shoulder it faces. If this does not work, use very strong traction, with two assistants pulling on the arm.
Two assistants should also hold the patient steady to prevent movement during traction. The arm is then rotated in all directions after wrapping the hand in a folded cloth or wide bandage. The physician should coat their hands with oil to facilitate smooth manipulation of the joint.
The joint is then pushed firmly until it returns to its place. Afterward, apply a dressing with astringent and drying agents mixed with egg white. Bind it tightly and suspend the arm from the patient’s neck, leaving it immobilized for several days.
Then, the binding is removed. If the joint remains stable in its position, leave it unbound. If the joint is not yet firmly set, reapply the dressing and binding and leave it for a few more days before removing it. If stiffness occurs after the joint has been returned and unbound...
...and movement is difficult, use moisturization in the bath, gentle massage, and pressing to soften it. Alternatively, place the fat of a fattened ram over the joint, bind it, and leave it for a day and a night. Then remove it, take the patient to the bath, and rub the joint moderately after sweating.
Repeat applying the fat once, twice, or three times with visits to the bath until the joint softens. If preferred, apply fresh cow dung lightly mixed with fat to the joint and bind it several times. This will soften the joint and restore it to its original state.
The twenty-eighth chapter.
On the treatment of wrist dislocation.
The wrist frequently dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints. However, it is important to return it immediately upon dislocation before the area swells or hot inflammation occurs.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient’s wrist on a board while an assistant extends the hand. The physician places their palm on the joint protrusion and pushes it until it returns to place. However, it must be observed if the dislocation has shifted to the palm side.
If so, the patient’s dorsal hand should rest on the board during traction and reduction. If the dislocation protrudes to the dorsal side, the palm should rest on the board to allow the physician’s hand to press the joint protrusion directly. If the joint does not immediately return, bind it with an anti-inflammatory dressing.
Leave it and do not attempt to correct it again, as it will not endure and you will not be able to reduce it after several days. The joint will remain deformed but will not harm the patient unless the hand becomes limp and unable to grasp anything.
In such a case, you will know that the nerve has been severed or crushed, and there is no remedy except cauterization, which may or may not be effective. Once the wrist is returned, apply the dressing previously described, bind it tightly, and leave it for five days.
Then remove the binding and exercise the hand. If movement is difficult and stiffness occurs, soften it with heated water and massage it multiple times until it becomes supple.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
On the treatment of finger dislocation.
The fingers can dislocate in any direction. If a finger dislocates toward the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and press the dislocation with your thumb until it returns. Then bind the finger’s tip and suspend it in the direction of the dislocation.
Leave it for two days, then release and extend it until it is straight. On that day, if it is night, bind it again as described. Continue to unbind it during the day for exercise and bind it at night, repeating this for several days until it becomes strong.
Do the same if the finger dislocates toward the palm, binding it in the same direction and treating it as previously described until it heals. Apply this method for dislocations in all directions.
The thirtieth chapter.
On the treatment of spinal vertebra dislocation.
If a complete dislocation of a spinal vertebra occurs, whether in the back or neck, or if multiple vertebrae are displaced, there is no treatment, as death quickly overtakes the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient’s stool exits involuntarily, and he is unable to control it. Often, some of his limbs become slack, either his legs, his arms, or one of them. As for when one vertebra slips from its place, it often dislocates.
Its displacement can occur in four directions. The one that displaces backward is called a hump. As for its treatment, you must consider: if the hump formed in childhood, there is no cure for it and no recovery whatsoever. But if it occurred due to a fall, a blow, or the like.
The ancients mentioned various treatments for it with lengthy descriptions, most of which are of little benefit. I have summarized from that what little suffices to replace much of what they mentioned, drawing from my own experience of the matter and my explanation of it, and I have designed the tool differently from what they described.
I say that a hump that forms in the front on the chest cannot be treated or healed, nor can those on the sides. Only the one that forms on the back is treated with what I am about to describe, which is to lay the patient face down.
On a level bench near a wall, you spread a soft cushion underneath him so that his chest is not harmed. Then, you place an upright wooden pole embedded in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench near his head and another wooden pole near his legs at the other end of the bench.
A servant holds one of the poles, ensuring it is not firmly fixed in the hole, and another servant holds the other pole in the same manner. Then, you wrap the patient’s chest and under his armpits with a soft and secure bandage, extending its end to the pole near his head and tying it there.
Then, you secure another bandage above his hips, over his knees, and at his ankles. You gather all the ties and fasten them to the other pole near his feet. Each servant pulls the pole on their side with the ties, ensuring the poles do not move from their positions in the ground.
However, as we said, they are not fixed securely. The doctor places his hands on the vertebra with force until it returns, or he places a board on it and presses on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, take a board about three cubits long.
Carve a notch into the wall near the patient where the end of the board can be inserted. Then, place the middle of the board on the hump, and the doctor presses down on the other end with his feet, applying firm pressure to compress the vertebra.
This will return it to its place. If you prefer, you can use a hand-cranked screw device. For this, embed two wooden stakes about a cubit long into the ground near the patient’s head at the end of the bench, and two similar stakes at the other end near his feet.
Let the distance between each pair of stakes be a span. Each stake should have a hole through which the screw passes. Fix all the stakes firmly into the ground so they do not move at all. Insert a rounded rod, which acts as the screw for twisting the ties, into the holes of each pair of stakes.
At the end of the screw, there is a hole into which a stick, a span long, is securely inserted for turning. The same is done for the other stakes. Then, you fasten the ties wrapped around the patient’s chest to the screw near his head and the ties on his legs to the screw near his feet.
A servant stands by each screw, turning it with the handle used for twisting the screw, while the doctor adjusts the hump as described earlier. This is the setup of the screw device, the bench, and the patient.
After the vertebra returns and the area is realigned, you should apply a drying compress made of egg whites, followed by tow (fibrous material). Over this dressing, place a splint made of wood about three fingers wide and as long as the area of the hump.
Extend the splint over some of the intact vertebrae and secure it with an appropriate bandage. The patient should use light, nourishing food until healed. If some swelling remains in the area at the end of recovery, use softening and relaxing medications while continuing to apply the splint described for a long period.
A lead plate may also be used for this purpose. Occasionally, a protrusion occurs in the last vertebrae of the spine, mistaken for dislocation, but it is actually an excess bone growth. Do not attempt to treat it with this method, as it may result in death.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the Treatment of a Dislocated Hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are prone only to dislocation and not to the minor displacement or concavity that occurs in other joints. The hip joint can dislocate in four directions.
These are inward, outward, forward, and backward. It most commonly dislocates inward and rarely forward or backward. The sign of an inward dislocation is that when you compare the patient’s healthy leg to the affected one, the healthy leg appears longer.
The knee protrudes more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend the affected leg at the groin. The area near the groin becomes clearly swollen because the head of the femur has moved there.
The signs of an outward dislocation are the opposite of these symptoms. The sign of a forward dislocation is that the patient fully extends the leg but cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he attempts to walk, he cannot move forward.
He retains his urine, his groin swells, and when walking, he steps on his heel. The sign of a backward dislocation is that he cannot straighten his knee or bend it until after bending the groin, and his affected leg is also shorter than the other.
The groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly visible near the hip. As for reducing such dislocations, observe: if the dislocation is old, has persisted with the patient, and was never attempted to be treated, there is absolutely no remedy.
You should not interfere with it. However, if the dislocation is recent, regardless of which of the four types it is, promptly twist the joint, stretch it inward and outward, and move it right and left. This may suffice.
If it returns to place, no further treatment is needed. If it does not, you should appoint a strong assistant to pull the leg downward either with his hands or by a band tied around the leg above the knee, while another assistant pulls from above.
The second assistant should place his hands under the patient’s armpits and tie a soft band around the top of the thigh. A third assistant should hold the band’s end and pull it either forward from the groin toward the collarbone or backward toward the back.
All should pull simultaneously until the patient’s body lifts off the ground and remains suspended. This type of traction is common to all four types of dislocations. If the dislocation is resolved by this method, there is no need for further treatment; otherwise, specific remedies for each type are required.
For reducing an inward dislocation, the patient should lie on his uninjured side. Place a band around the top of the thigh, between the femoral head and the area beneath the groin.
Extend the band upward from the groin toward the upper body and the collarbone. Then, a strong assistant should use his arms to embrace the thick part of the affected thigh and pull it outward with strong traction. This will return the joint to its place.
This method is easier than other treatments for reducing this joint. If it proves difficult or ineffective, tie both legs of the patient with a strong but soft band at the ankles and knees.
The tied legs should be about four fingers apart, and the affected leg should be extended about two fingers longer than the other. Then suspend the patient by the head from a beam in the house, with a distance of about two cubits from the ground.
Then instruct a strong boy to hold the head of the femur while another boy hangs onto the patient. The first boy applies force to the femur head, causing the joint to quickly return to its position. For an outward dislocation reduction:...
The patient should lie on the bench as described for the treatment of kyphosis. Tie a band specifically around the affected leg and the chest. Place one wooden post near his feet and another near his head, then position an additional firmly secured wooden post in the middle of the bench.
Wrap the middle post with damp cloths to avoid harming the patient, ensuring the post is between his thighs so he does not slip downward during traction. Then, each assistant pulls in their respective direction while the physician adjusts the hip with his hands. If the joint responds and returns...
If not, place a board on the hip and press it, as described for kyphosis treatment, except the patient should lie on his uninjured side. For a forward dislocation, extend the patient's leg at once while keeping him in this same position on the bench.
The physician places his right hand on the affected groin, pressing it with the other hand while applying downward pressure toward the knee. For a backward dislocation, the patient should not be pulled downward.
Instead, he should be positioned on something solid. The same applies to outward dislocations, where the patient should lie face down on the bench as previously described, with the bands firmly tied.
As previously stated, use compression with the board on the area where the joint has dislocated. When the hip joint has been completely restored as it should, its proper return will be evident when you extend the patient’s legs.
If the legs appear even and the patient can bend and straighten the leg without difficulty, the joint has returned to its proper position. At this point, bind the thighs together, apply a bandage, and secure them with a tight band to prevent the hip from moving in any direction.
The patient should remain at rest for three or four days. Then, remove the bandage and bindings and compare the leg with the other. If they are equal in length, the dislocation is fixed, and the patient can begin walking. If there is any weakness...
Reapply the bandage and bindings as before, leaving them for another three days. Then remove them again, and have the patient walk slowly for a few days until full strength is restored, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee dislocates in three directions: inward, outward, and downward—that is, backward—and it never dislocates forward at all. The sign of its dislocation is to instruct the patient to bring their leg toward their thigh.
If the leg does not attach to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. To correct any type of dislocation, have the patient sit down with legs extended if they can bear it, and have an assistant sit behind them to hold their torso and slightly pull it backward. Then, you sit on their thighs.
Press your back against their front, placing their leg between your legs. Grip their knee firmly with your hands, interlocking your fingers around it, and press the sides of the knee forcefully. An assistant pulls the leg until the knee returns to its place.
The sign of its proper return is that the leg will attach to the thigh gently without force. Then, bandage it, secure the leg to the thigh, and bind them together with a bandage for three or four days before releasing it. Only light walking should be done for a few days until it strengthens.
If it does not return as described, apply strong traction using the bindings previously described for treating the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of ankle dislocation.
The ankle may shift slightly or fully dislocate, and its dislocation may be inward or outward. The sign of its dislocation is a swollen and protruding ankle in the direction it has dislocated.
As for a minor shift, it is easy to correct by gently pulling and aligning it until it returns. For a complete dislocation, have the patient sit while a strong assistant holds their torso from behind.
Then, hold the top of the foot with your right hand and the back of the heel with your left hand. Pull the foot toward you first with the right hand, then with the left, repeating twice. Then extend it with the left hand while pushing the front of the foot toward the leg with the right hand, gently.
Repeat this twice as described, and on the third attempt, push the front of the foot toward the leg while pulling at the heel. If the foot realigns after one or two attempts and appears straight, it has been corrected. Otherwise, repeat the process until it returns.
If it does not return as described, lay the patient on their back on the ground. Securely drive a stake into the ground so that it is positioned between their thighs, wrapping it with cloth to prevent harm to the patient. Then have an assistant hold the thigh.
Another assistant pulls the leg, either using their hands or a binding tied around the leg’s neck. Each assistant pulls in opposite directions, while the stake remains between the patient’s thighs to prevent the body from being pulled downward. The physician then realigns the dislocation with their hands.
Another assistant holds the healthy leg downward, as the dislocation will return quickly. Once the dislocation has returned and you confirm its proper alignment, apply bandages and cotton, securing it tightly with firm bindings, and immobilize the foot downward. Care must be taken not to tie the binding too tightly over the tendon above the back of the ankle.
This is to prevent excessive pressure on the tendon, which could cause harm. Leave the binding for two or three days; if it loosens, tighten it, then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If the patient attempts to walk before this period, the dislocation may recur and worsen, making further treatment ineffective. If a hot swelling occurs, you should use the remedies we have described elsewhere to reduce it, including rinsing, until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of toe dislocation.
A dislocated toe should be realigned with slight traction without force. This is not difficult but rather simple. If the dislocation involves joints on the top of the foot, the patient should place their foot on a flat surface.
Alternatively, they can stand on a plank as if walking. Then, you should place your foot on the dislocated joint and press down firmly until it realigns and appears even, without any protrusions.
Place a plank under the sole of their foot that supports the entire foot and has two ends. Bind the foot tightly and securely to this plank for three days, then remove the binding and restrict walking for many days until it strengthens and the recurrence of dislocation is prevented, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On types of dislocation that occur with a wound, fracture, or both.
When such conditions occur and you attempt treatment or setting, it often results in death.
Thus, only a skilled practitioner with extensive experience, gentleness, compassion, patience, and caution—avoiding recklessness or boldness—should undertake such treatment. Initially, use remedies to calm the hot swelling and ensure the patient is stabilized.
This is unless you anticipate recovery without danger due to the mildness of the injury and observe signs of hope. In such cases, attempt immediate realignment before hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns to its proper position as intended, employ measures to reduce the hot swelling and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments. If the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and there are splintered bone fragments, proceed to remove them. Adhere to the guidelines we have described for simple conditions, as outlined earlier in their respective sections.
Exert your utmost effort and avoid engaging in hazardous practices, as I have previously advised. This will preserve your reputation and protect your integrity, God willing.
