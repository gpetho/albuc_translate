O sons, I have finished this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, because of your faith in me, because of your exposure, and because of your declarations, so I have undertaken to complete this treatise for you, which is a part of my art, that is to say, surgery.</end_of_turn>
For surgery is very rare in our land and in our time, so that the science of it is almost lost; and its witnesses are few; and it remains only with some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which alter the most and aggravate those errors and hesitation which were in them until understanding of them is clarified and their power and art is increased.</end_of_turn
And I believe that I have composed this treatise in such a way that it follows the way of exposure and declaration and abbreviation; and that it should be added to the forms of the instruments of cautery and other instruments of the work as well as for the addition of the declaration, and for preparation, which is necessary.</end_of_turn
The greatest cause for which a good craftsman is not found in our time in this art is that the art of medicine is long, and that it embraces many actors who must exercise themselves in the science of anatomy, since Gualius knew the movements of the limbs and the shapes of these, and the connection and separation of these; and the knowledge of bones, nerves and veins, and the number of these, and their colors; and of the pulse veins and the quietness of these, and the places of their sensation.</end_of_turn
And thus says Hippocrates that in my name is more, in the small work, and especially in the art of the hand.</end_of_turn>
And as we said at the beginning of this book, whoever is not learned in anatomy is not worthy of the name of a physician, because many have perished by the hands of those who have erred in this science. Indeed, I have seen many who have been trained in this science and have abandoned it.</end_of_turn
For I have seen a foolish and ignorant physician who, having incised an abscess of scrofula in the groin of a woman, has inciscated several arteries of the groin so that great blood flowed into her, and the woman died between her thighs.</end_of_turn
And I have seen another physician who, because he thought that a tumor had grown in a man who was in his prime, extracted that tumor with a piece of the bladder, and the man died on the third day.</end_of_turn
And I have already told you that I will speak of these things, and I have seen that because of the greatness of the tumor and the condition of the patient, he knew that he would die.</end_of_turn
And I have seen another physician who took a fee from a duke from our land for surgery, and he was indebted to a black slave who was his servant; and the physician, in his ignorance, extracted the fracture, with sponges and cloths, with great tension, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then I will show you according to your desires, and I will relieve you, and I will tell you to leave for a few days and command you to rest; and thus this matter was settled until the wound came out spontaneously, and the patient perished.</end_of_turn>
And I went to him and I showed him that the liament should be removed, and peace and joy appeared on his face, so that he forgot his pains.</end_of_turn
And indeed corruption had already been confirmed in the limb, for it was not able to restrain that, and it did not cease to spread corruption in the limb until the patient perished.</end_of_turn>
And I have seen another physician who performed an operation on a cancerous tumor, and made an ulcer nearby for several days, until the tumor grew bigger than it had before.</end_of_turn
The cause of this is that cancer is pure melancholic humor, and that it does not suffice for it to be overcome by all the forces of the will, but that it should be overcome in every limb in which the patient suffers from it.</end_of_turn
And for this reason, sons, it is necessary for you that the art of surgery be divided into two parts: that is, in surgery in which there is associated health, and in surgery in which there is peril in the greatest precautions.</end_of_turn
And I have already spoken of this in all this book in the place where I mentioned surgery in which there is error and fear; for it is necessary for you to guard against this and to leave that behind, so that the fools do not think that they can speak and despise you.</end_of_turn
Therefore take up the sacred arms in the request of God, and the sacred sick in the mercy and protection of God.
And use the best way through God's grace to preserve health and praiseworthy success, and lay aside the terrible diseases of difficult healing, and rest the sacred arms from those which make you fear, so that you may rejoice in your faith and in your name, for it is remaining for your glory, both here and hereafter with the holy ones.</end_of_turn>
Indeed, I have already spoken in several of your monasteries.</end_of_turn> “No cure any disease badly, for thus no will many doctors be named.”</end_of_turn
And I have already finished this book according to three chapters.</end_of_turn>
Begin the division of the book, and first of the first part.</end_of_turn The first chapter ordered of the head downwards, concerning the forms of instruments and the utensils of cautery, and what is necessary for the operation.</end_of_turn
The division of the second part.</end_of_turn The second chapter, concerning swelling and perforation, and windings, and ulcers, and the extraction of arrows and similar things, all classified and ordered concerning the forms of instruments.</end_of_turn
The third chapter, concerning restoration and dislocation, and care of twists and similar things; classified and ordered from the head downwards, and concerning the forms of instruments.</end_of_turn
Since I have said what is the quality of the instruments of that cautery and their documents, and in what completion it is prohibited to cauterize.</end>
Therefore I say that the speech concerning the quality of the cautery instruments and their documents is a long and profound speech, subtle for science, and a secret hidden; and that many learned men have spoken of it, and they disagree with each other, and to me it seems that a little of their speeches suffices, fearing a prolongation.</end>
Therefore I say that cautery conforms to all universal completion except for two completions, which are caudal completions of its matter.</end
In the caudal and dry completion with its matter, disagreement arises; for some say that cautery is useful for that, while others say the opposite, that cautery is not convenient in diseases of the same kind as its quality and dryness, for the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that the disease be cold and dry with what is cauterized and dry to be healed.</end
And I say that whoever says the opposite, that for cautery is useful in every cold and dry disease that is seen in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of a man with the humidity of the air to the completion of the fire, you find the body of a man cold.
And I say concerning this speech that I have already experienced it several times in my practice.</end
However, I do not say that because of this everything concerning that which has already been exposed and exercised in the chapter of cautery after practice, and to know the diversity of the men and the situation of diseases in their bodies, and the causes of these, and their accidents, and the space of time of these.</end
However, in other completions, this is not your fear, and especially in cold and wet diseases, for already all doctors agree on these, and they do not disagree concerning the use of cautery in these.</end
And know, children, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire and of the goodness of it, is about cautery with acute medicine, for the fire is simple, the action of which reaches only the member that is cauterized and does not notice the other member with it adjusted except for a small document.</end
For the action of acute medicine reaches only that in the limb from which it is administered, and it makes it come into the diseased limb of difficult healing and makes it go away.</end<end_turn>
For the fire, by its subtlety and substance, does not do anything but what is already known to us by experience and by the length of our service in the study of the truth of causes; and for this reason I am excused from the length of this speech, for it is not written in this book for you the secret of the fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies and the expulsion of the disease by which it is expelled.
Indeed, master, the best time for cautery and rest is in the earlier days of spring.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, so that its document for the accidental time is submerged in the benefit of that which makes the cautery hurtful, especially if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, which do not suffer from delay, for fear of those who come late, which is greater than a small document entering at the time.</end_of_turn>
And I do not say that we must not cut in other cases, or, master, those who do not esteem but the vulgar people and fools among the doctors, so it is that for that disease which is cured by cautery, it is not ridiculous at all times, and rest that consequence.</end_of_turn>
And the cause is not thus that they say because it is cut, for cautery is nothing but in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause of these pains.</end_of_turn
However, excessive cautery surpasses medicine by the will of its value and the virtue of its operation and greatness of the patient.</end_of_turn>
And it is possible that the disease will return at any hour of the time, according to the complexion of the disease and the location of the disease, and the virtue of the things which are prepared in the body from the accumulation of humors in it, and that which is obtained by them in their acquisition in food and drinks and the like of those causes; but when the disease in which cautery is administered is a subtle disease in a limb with few superfluities and humors, just as if it were cautery for pain and like that, it is possible that in them the said pain will not return, even if it is made small.</end_of_turn>
And it may be said vulgarly that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and it is a subtle art, not to those who understand it, for they grow that it is not a cure that makes use of medicine or any other cause except cautery.</end_of_turn
And the cause is contrary to that; and the understanding that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is true only when they administer the methods of care in certain diseases, and those medicines do not confer, and at the end of the cause they administer manuevers of cautery, and take advantage of that.</end_of_turn And the hour has passed sixteen that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding which the vulgar people and the fools of the doctors have.</end_of_turn
And I say to them the old men that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and I do not say anything but for the equality of the gold and the limitation of its substance.</end_of_turn
And I say that the place of cautery does not make it bad, as it is not absolutely true, for I have already seen that it does not do anything but in cases where the others do not work, and that cautery with that is good and better than with iron, just as they say; however, when you make cautery with fire from gold, it is not your business to declare, for it is ignited according to the quantity you wish for the roughness of the gold, and prepare to receive cold; and if you adjust over it the fire will consume the gold for the fire, and if there are some plates in the fire so that the craftsman cuts for the occupation of that.</end_of_turn
And for this reason it is useful to make cautery with iron, we must put it more lightly and more cautiously to the rectification of the operation.</end_of_turn
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those who are coming after me to do the same concerning the feet, so that I may relieve those who ask me what they want of me.</end_of_turn
First chapter.</end_of_turn>
This cauterization confers cold and humidity upon the accidental cause of which it is useful, so it is the cause of soda and multiple flows of rheumatic flux, applied to the cortex, from the head to the limbs and the joints fluent, and multiple of sleep, and toothache and gut pain, and universally of all diseases that come from cold, even as paralysis, sopor and apoplexy, and it is similar in these diseases.</end_of_turn
The way of this cauterization is as follows: first command the patient to evacuate with laxatives for three or four nights, according as you exceed the virtue of the disease and the age of it and its custom.</end_of_turn
And then command him to shave his head with a razor, and do that between his thighs on a fallen bench and place his hands on his feet.</end_of_turn
And keep your wrist close to the thumb, over the bridge of the nose between the eyebrows. Moreover, when the doctor suspects the location of the pain, he should touch it and with a pointed cautery he should burn a little olive oil of the shape of that:
Then he should place it over the painful area, holding it firmly so that the hand does not slip away, and you should gradually tighten it
Then lift your hand lightly and support the area, and if you see already some quantity of the head of the bone uncovered, thus as much as the quantity of barley of errors, then raise your hand again, and if it has not returned, do the same with the other hand, until it is seen from the bone that you have said.
And take a little salt and dissolve it on the area and keep it there for three days.
And keep it covered in oil at the border and keep it there until the burn of the fire is healed And take care of the area with four medicines until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And I say that when the wound remains open, so much honey should be given to the patient, because it is better and more helpful.</start_of_turn>
I say to you that the bone should be cauterized until the bone itself, and that it should be held cauterized until all the parts of the substance of the bone have healed.</start_of_turn>
And keep it moist that which is adjacent to the bone, and keep it cured.</start_of_turn
And I say that it should be cauterized until the marrow appears, until it strengthens the bone within that the bone is softened, and this is the form of small alphbetization.</start_of_turn And it is estimated that from that area the vapors of the head expire.</start_of_turn>
And if the wound remains open for a long time, and it should be cured when it is consolidated.</start_of_turn
I do not see these two kinds of cautery in all my life, except in some men according to their fear; and leave it, for you, it is better to be healthy than to be burned, when it is possible; for the head is developed by the solution of continuity of its parts as we have testified in other members, and more when the head of the patient is of fiery nature.</start_of_turn
The first kind of cautery is better and more useful for you; and of that one and of this work we have health.
Chapter two.</start_of_turn>
Of the cautery of the head.</start_of_turn
When in all the head chronic pain and lasting pain occurs and it lasts in the disease for a long time, and when it is used of herbs and of poultices and of capsulars and of plasters and of butter and of vinegar and of broth and of eggs and of rosemary, and especially if it has already been cauterized with a cautery that they recount and that does not benefit it from any of those causes, then consider that if the head of the disease is of strong creation in its nature; and it is not fiery and does not find great heat, then that which cauterizes with another cautery leaves a little space.</start_of_turn And cauterize that on the nail of the heel up to the marrow is separated.</start_of_turn Incise the bone and uncover from the bone the quantity that we have recounted and cauterize that with a cautery in the posterior part of the head in the area where the wind is stopped. And withdraw your hand in help, and do not uncover the bone, for the disease for this finds great pain other than the pain of all the other cauteries of the head.</start_of_turn
I say this cautery in its place, for the cautery of which we cauterize the nails of the head and the occiput is more subtle than that which we cauterize the middle part of the head; and this is the way of it.</start_of_turn
Chapter three.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of the ancient emigration.</start_of_turn
When in the part of the head severe pain or widespread pain spreads into the heel, be evacuated with medicines that soften the head, and be administered the other care that I have mentioned in the preceding diseases; and all this without benefit, for the cautery in them is done in two ways: either with acute medical burning or with fire.</start_of_turn
May the cautery be applied with medicine, for you shall take a dose of ale, evacuate that and remove the extremities from both hands. And approach the area of pain in the temple with a lancet, so that the wound is visible, leaving the hair covered.
And strengthen the area around it with a compress of constriction, and leave it for three hours; then remove the dressing and give the patient ale, and leave the wound covered for two or three days, and put your hand over the area that is below the knee until the pain subsides
And care for that which is affected until it is healed
And if you wish, know that there are many medicines that combat these which I have written in the treatise of medicinal treatments
May the cautery be applied according to this manner: fire for cautery of which this is the form:
and it is called closed nails, because its head is like a nail with a curvature in which there is a small prominence in the middle of the area.</start_turn>
And place your hand over the area of pain, and hold your hand — because the vessel that is left behind must not be torn — and remove the fire little by little with speed.
And if the quantity of the blood that is left behind by the specification of the wound is as great as most of it, elevate your hand so that the artery that is left behind does not suffer injury, so that there is no flow of blood.</start_turn
And immerse the area in salt water and leave it there for three days; then remove the dressing and cover the area with a bandage, and care for it until it is healed.</start_turn
And if you wish, cauterize at the tip of the toe according to the cautery, and keep the incision of the artery in this area away from the tip of the toe in particular, because it is not an old wound.</start_turn
Chapter four.</start_turn>
Of the cautery of an old wound.</start_turn
When you have cured the wound according to what has been said of the previous care, and what has been said in the division of diseases, and you do not take advantage of the care, and sometimes for the disease does not suffice for it what has been said of the first care or of the cautery with fire, then you must wait until the fire has become white before you cauterize the toe, because it signifies over the area of pain along the length of which is the greater part of the finger, or whatever; and withdraw your hand for a moment and strengthen it before you make the incision and reach the bone.</start_turn
However necessary it is that you guard the continuity of the mandible, which is unfortunate because of chewing, and that the wound does not suffer injury and the nerves that are in it do not suffer damage, and that no spasm occurs.</start_turn
And if it is about the custody and care of the flow of blood of the artery that is being cauterized, which is feared, and more so in that one that ignores what is done and is negligent; leave the operation to the beginning.</start_turn
And I come to remember the regimen of the flow of blood in case of injury to the artery according to its manner, in this place of this book.</start_turn
And if you see this disease that this cautery does not suffice and you see the body of the patient tolerable, cauterize that in the middle part of the head as we have recounted, and care for the wound until it is healed.</start_turn
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the stretching of the artery with two nails, and this is a better cautery and safer.</start_turn
Chapter five.</start_turn
Of the cautery of the pains of the heel.</start_turn
When in the heel there is pain due to cold and it is cured by means of lacative causes and by the other care that has been mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then ignite the cautery, which is called puncture, of which this is the form:
And approach the puncture near the fire, and be careful around the entire heel as if it were rotating, or in the area of any abscess if the pain is in any place.</start_turn Along with you the cautery of the root of the heel a little at a time because you have to mark the area with your hand.</start_turn
If it is necessary to make several points on the whole ankle, and which are those, then take care of the wound until it is healed.
When several punctures are necessary throughout the ankle, and which are these, then care for the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
From pointed cautery.</start_of_turn
The wound which is being cauterized is cured by the pointed cautery, and it is not anything other than the specific things which cause swelling, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.</start_of_turn
Avoid cautery of the area which must be dry or which has a spasm of the nerve.</start_of_turn
When you have cured that area of the ankle with blistering and blistering plaster, and you have supported it with bandages, do not touch the wound, for now you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one to remove the root of the hair, the second a little to leave the area with some feeling, and the third to join the two lips.</start_of_turn
And rest the wound for the opposite of the diseased part, for the burn does not see anything but the part that appears to be healed.</start_of_turn
And the way to cauterize is that you cauterize that area which is around the ankle joint above a little over the heel, and in the temper another, the length of which should be according to the length of the digit which is below, and stop your hand when the quantity of the matter of the wound has been consumed.</start_of_turn
This is the way of cautery, and it is the way of the surgeon, the form of which is like a saw.</start_of_turn More importantly, do not make the wound too wide; and cover that of excessive thickness with a little.</start_of_turn
And take care of the wound so that it is as it is at the beginning when it is healed.</start_of_turn
End of document.</start_of_turn
Of pointed cautery of ancient apoplexy.</start_of_turn
When the apoplexy is ancient and you have cured that which we have said, and do not touch your medicine, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize that area with four cauteries: over all the heel of the foot; at the edge and the middle of the foot, as we have said; and in the groin.</start_of_turn The method of cautery is sufficient as it has been said.</start_of_turn
And it is already cauterized over the mouth of the stomach; and it is better later; and take care of it as it proceeds.</start_of_turn
End of document.</start_of_turn
Of pointed cautery for effective oblivion for inflammation.</start_of_turn
Cover that the patient gives to the physician in the beginning with large doses of wine and pills which serve to mitigate it.</start_of_turn
And take care of the whole patient and stop their groaning, and place your hand over their groin as described in the treatise on plasters.</start_of_turn
And stop any herbs, for that is the way of cautery.</start_of_turn And do it as that wise man has already said.</start_of_turn
And thus if for those who are well it is good; and if not, then do three cauteries in the latter part of the heel, which are dependent from the most elevated part of the foot up to the most distant part of the heel.</start_of_turn And stop between each cautery the thickness of a finger, and take care of the cautery as it proceeds.</start_of_turn
More if you become addicted and the patient is so tolerant, then do the cautery in the middle of the foot; and if you wish to have greater addiction, then cauterize that over the two nails.</start_of_turn
Take care of the wound once it is healed; and let the cautery be olive oil according to the manner which is recommended.</start_of_turn
End of document.</start_of_turn
Of cautery of parasites and of the softening of the whole body.</start_of_turn
Cover that you process in the mitigation of the head with wine and what we have said; and take care of the patient's head, and cauterize that which is cauterized in the middle of the foot, and over all the nails, and over the latter part of the body, and with three cauteries over the vertebrae of the heel.</start_of_turn
If the disease of mollification of the body of troops is severe and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize four times on the spines of the two, and immediately cauterize until it is covered with codena mot, and remove your hand. And thus treat the remaining part that is healthy, and this time cauterize olive oil.</end_of_turn>
The text is now complete.
On cauterization for epilepsy.</end_of_turn>
It is not cauterized for epilepsy, but for that epilepsy is from spasm.</end_of_turn
And therefore modify the brain of it at the beginning and towards the end of the treatment, and in the other treatment which we have dictated in the division when the illness is great and the patient tolerates the exception of medicines.</end_of_turn>
And if it is a child who does not suffer from the medicines, then administer astringents and masticators, giving him this for several days, to the benefit of the diet.</end_of_turn
Then remove the head of the illness, and then cauterize once in the middle of the head according to the manner mentioned above, and again cauterize in the back of the head, and over every corner of the head you should cauterize.</end_of_turn And if the illness is great and is tolerated, then cauterize as many times as I have said, having paralyzed and mollified the body over the spines of the buttocks and the spines of the two.</end_of_turn
And cauterize olive oil as it has been previously directed.</end_of_turn
Even if the illness is a child, then pause the cautery subtilely according to this manner.</end_of_turn
The text is now complete.</end_of_turn>
On cauterization for melancholy.</end_of_turn
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and great spasm, then cauterize as many times as I have said above, having paralyzed.</end_of_turn
And if the cause of melancholy is excessive fluidity declining to melancholy, and the body of the patient is humid, then give him to drink that which modifies the brain of it according to what has been said in the division.</end_of_turn
Then remove the head of the illness, and then make a gentle rotation downwards with the thumb and forefinger over the circle, and stop that in the middle of the head.</end_of_turn
And the patient should be made to vomit, and be held entirely still.</end_of_turn
And then stop liniment; and it is more advisable to border against she-goats.</end_of_turn And cover that over the fire for temperate heating, which tells him to suffer when it is more in him.</end_of_turn And then put that in the middle of the head of him in the circle, and keep it until it is heated through.</end_of_turn
And give him to drink every day a meal for a week, or do another regimen of him that he is healthy; or if you will, cauterize those who make little points according to the greatest of them, but keep your hand over his hand in order: this is a kind of cautery that moistens the brain equally.</end_of_turn
And then stop that pot belly in border or in gray of grease.</end_of_turn
The text is now complete.</end_of_turn
On cauterization of water descending in the sweat.</end_of_turn
When it is announced to you at the beginning of sweating for the symptoms which I have said in the division, then begin and give him to drink the patient the water which modifies his head, and keep that from all humors.</end_of_turn
And make him sweat in bath in lukewarm water for several days.</end_of_turn
And order him to rest his head, and cauterize once in the middle of the head; and cauterize twice on two temples if this is the beginning of sweating from two sweats, or once on the cheek if it is the beginning of sweating from one sweat.</end_of_turn
Incisions are made over all the veins and arteries which are left over the codena; and these are cauterized in that length in the width of the temples.</end_of_turn
Keep yourself away from the flow of blood when cauterizing; if you see blood flowing, leave any medicine behind, for it is of no use to you.
And indeed I learned this wisdom in the extraction of arteries and in the excision of those and caution against the flow of blood.</end_turn>
And every vein is cauterized at the junction of two bones by two cautery instruments, which are produced immediately.</end_turn
(The text continues with the next section of the treatise.)</start_of_turn>
Of the cauterization of ancient tears.</start_of_turn
When tears from the eyes are ancient and have become thick and clotted in the veins and arteries which are in the upper part of the head, and it has been verified that these are harmful humors, then cauterize that which we recounted at the beginning in the chapter concerning the beginning of water when it is poured over the eyes, and also cauterize in the middle part of the head and two cauteries at the junction of two temples, and two cauteries at the junction of two bones.</start_of_turn And if you wish to proceed further, then cauterize that on the whole breadth of the cheek over the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.</start_of_turn
(The text continues with the next section of the treatise.)</start_of_turn
Of the cauterization of the stench of the nose.</start_of_turn
When your physician has said what he has to say and has not benefited from your medicine, then you appear and give the patient wine to drink for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize the middle part with a cautery of olive oil.</start_of_turn And indeed cauterize that which is between the eyebrows with two cautery instruments over the two eyebrows with hair a little bit.
And keep yourself away from the artery that you do not burn that one.</start_of_turn
And this is the form of the cauterization of the claw.</start_of_turn
(The text continues with the next section of the treatise.)</start_of_turn
Of the cauterization of the softening of the eyelids of the eyes.</start_of_turn
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by disease or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery of this kind; and this is the way to do it:</start_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize that over the two eyebrows a little bit with two cautery instruments in the whole part, and let them extend from the temples.</start_of_turn And let the length of each cautery be according to the quantity of the eyebrow.</start_of_turn
And do not press too much your hand with the cautery, but according to the quantity that the third part of the eyelid is adhered.</start_of_turn
(The text continues with the next section of the treatise.)</start_of_turn
Of the cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are converted to the parts behind the eyebrows and put the eye out.</start_of_turn
When the hairs of the eye are converted to the parts behind the eyebrows as well as when you put the eye out, cauterize in those two ways, either by burning or by medicinal fire.</start_of_turn
If you burn with the cautery, command the patient to lick his wounds until they are prolonged and equal; and if you put out the eye, then strengthen the eyes of the patient with a bandage so that they are not painful until the hairs are born anew.</start_of_turn
When the hairs are born anew and equal, then pause the head of the patient in the chest and then put your hand over the eyelid of the eye with your finger, as it is according to the figure of the palm of a hand, and be the beginning of the signal at the edge of the hairs.</start_of_turn
And indeed pause the blood clot in vomit or in mucus of eggs over the eye.</start_of_turn
And indeed this is the form of the cautery.</start_of_turn
And indeed cauterize over the figure which you have signed, little by little, in veins that are seen, until the surface of the wound which is like a palm of a hand is completely burned, as it is indeed like a palm of a hand.</start_of_turn
The sign of the completion of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already being contracted and the hairs of the eye already being elevated beyond the puncture of the eye.</start_of_turn
Therefore raise your hand and lay it upon the patient for three days, and then pause your hand over the edge of the wound until it has healed. And take care of that which is inflamed until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if it returns for any reason, then renew the cautery and soften the area with your finger, for the pain will have vanished as it did at first.</end_of_turn>

Maybe apply medicine and burn this so that the patient reads the area until it is prolonged and equal, and then apply a paper bandage in the shape of a palm leaf.</end_of_turn
And take a spoonful of broth and cause him to drink water once.</end_of_turn namely.</end_of_turn> or how much, and mix these causes well, and make him drink water quickly so that he does not become chilled; and expand a little water over the paper which is applied thus in the shape of a palm leaf, and place that over a foul smell or both; and place the patient's head in the pit of the abdomen, and let the patient's head rest on his chest.</end_of_turn
And pause for a little while about the medicine and give him a little, and do not delay until the patient feels the biting of the medicine, which is in him just like fire.</end_of_turn
Therefore when he feels the biting of the medicine, then read the medicine and leave that which is in his belly as he has been told; when the biting of the medicine ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the area with water; and consider whether the area is already elevated as it is washed away from the constriction by fire or incision, for this is good; and if it does not return about the medicine on the place where it was not put until the medicine has been absorbed and the wound has healed.</end_of_turn
And pause your hand over the edge of the wound until the mark of the wound has disappeared, and take care of that which is inflamed until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you to know that you must keep watch diligently over the wound so that no more medicine is spilled, and if the area is painful for several days, it is softened and any cause of the area's pain is gone, then repeat the medicine on that area which is softened, just as you did at the beginning, and let him recover until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
This is the shape of a palm leaf.</end_turn

Chapter XVII.</end_turn
Of cautery of fistula which is in the tear duct of the eye.</end_turn
When you cure the fistula with water as we have said in the divisions of diseases, do not trust your care, then cauterize as follows: command the patient to keep his head down on his chest, and have his head held by some minister between the thighs in such a way that it is neither too high nor too low on the chest.</end_of_turn
And pause your hand immersed in water or in slime over the eye.</end_of_turn
And take the cautery which is of this form:
which is conquered, thus as the shape of a hook or of a turning pin, from one extremity to the other where the cautery is applied.</end_turn
And if you wish, pierce through to the other extremity.</end_turn And if you wish, withdraw thus as you did.</end_turn
Better is that which is conquered to the chest work.</end_turn
And immediately close the fistula if it is open, and bring it back to its natural place and dry that.</end_of_turn And if it is not open, then open that and remove the pus from it.</end_of_turn
And pause your hand over the cautery which is well ignited, and hold his hand over the eye with a little of the cautery of the eye to the side of the nose, so that neither your hand nor the patient is irritated, and then pause the cautery on the gray matter of the eye and remove that.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if at the commencement of the wound the cautery has penetrated the bone, it is not good; but if it has not, repeat the cautery once or twice more if necessary. Leave that to rest for three days, and then place your hand over that part and send for an exsiccator to drain it until it is healed.
If it has been a few days and it has not healed, then suspend the corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and as much as it is convenient according to the custom of the sick person
Another method of cautery for fistula is as follows: enter the fistula and leave that there for a while, and then place your hand on the surrounding tissue, which is the cause of the fistula. Leave enough of the fistula open to allow the blood to flow; but do not make the wound too large, for fear of causing further pain. Keep your hand over the wound until the fistula has healed completely.
If the fistula has healed as we have said concerning the cautery and the treatment, it is not necessary to do anything further; but if it has not healed, it is necessary to administer an emollient through the nose and reduce the fistula to the root of the nose according to the situation
Chapter XVIII.
Of cautery of the wound we speak further down
Many veins that accompany the nerves are cut accidentally by fissures in the lips, and especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat those fissures as we have said in the previous chapters and do not avail yourself of your treatment, then do the following:
And make the depth of the incision according to the thickness of the tissue.
And keep your hand firmly on that part until the cautery has reached the base of the fissures.
And take care of that until it is healed.
Chapter XIX
Of cautery of fistula in the mouth
When in the root of the uvula or on the palate or on the roots of the teeth there is excessive eating and it becomes painful, and it is broken, and it is softened, and there is formed a fistula, and when you have treated it and have not benefited from the treatment, then cover that area with cautery according to the amount that is received in the fistula. And put that light on the edge of the fistula, and put your hand over that until the fire of the light reaches the root of the fistula, and after that make an incision once or twice. And take care of that as we have said of the treatment until it is healed
Therefore, if the swelling is resolved and it is healed, it is not necessary to do anything further; but if it has not healed, it is necessary to uncover the root and remove the corrupted bone as it is convenient according to the custom of the patient
Chapter XX
Of cautery of the teeth and of smoothing of the veins
When the veins are softened by humidity and the teeth are blackened, and when you have treated those with medicines and they do not yield, then put the tip of the instrument in the belly of the patient and, having lit the cautery, make a small incision so that the flame reaches the root of the tooth without causing excessive heat.
And withdraw your hand and repeat the cautery several times as you wish
And rinse the patient’s mouth with salt water and keep it there for an hour, and then remove that, for the blackened tooth is stopped and the softened gum is strengthened and the putrid humidity is dried out
Chapter XXI
Of cautery for toothache
When toothache is caused by cold, or if it is too hot or does not yield to treatment with medicine, then do the following: either cauterize along the gum line or cauterize with fire.
Cauterizing along the gum line means that you take the edge of a piece of leather and put it into a pan of fire, and when it is red hot, you touch it to the edge of the tooth with your hand covered with cloth, and you keep it there until the tooth is numb.
And repeat that several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
If you wish, immerse a sponge or cloth in the border of the diseased limb, and rest it on the painful tooth, and rest it on the ignited instrument until the instrument reaches the depth of the curvature of the tooth.
However, the use of the cautery with fire is that you must be attentive to the quantity of charcoal or instrument, and in the midst of them any roughness and the sharpness of the fire should not reach the mouth of the patient.
And if you have ignited the cautery, let it take the shape you wish, and rest it on the tooth and keep your hand there until the cautery is cooled; and do whatever you can so that the pain may subside or on this day or on the next day
And know that in order to prevent infection from that cautery that the patient should fill his mouth with good broth and keep it there for an hour, and then remove it; and this is the method of the cautery.
And cauterize as much as you can according to what is possible for you.<end_turn>
This is the method of the cannula:
Chapter XXII.
Of the cautery of extrusions.
When extrusions are of fleck and cold humors and do not obey digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them lightly, then your fire will cauterize the shape as follows: with two limbs covered so that the smoke from the cautery does not reach the other limb, and rest the ignited instrument on that area for a while, and if you wish to digest further, do so until it reaches the bottom of the ulcer.
And if the ulcer is small, then rest the cautery according to the quantity of the ulcer, and keep it covered for three days and rest its sponge soaked in broth until it is consumed what the fire has consumed
And take care of that which is burnt and tents and cloths until it is healed
Chapter XXIII.
Of the cautery of the palate of the voice and of the constriction of the throat
When humidity is on the palate of the voice and is more so when it is cold of composition, then know that the patient must be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and then cauterize that beyond the root of the epiglottis in the recessed place
And take care that you do not reach the epiglottis with the cautery or burn the edge of the cord rather a little bit
And cauterize that beyond the other cautery must be done beyond the junction of the jaw at the back of the vertebra of the throat And the cautery of the throat is like a claw in the way mentioned above.
And take care of that which is before until it is healed
Chapter XXIV
Of the cautery of pulmonary disease and cough
When cough and pulmonary disease are of cold humors and the patient has neither fever nor rigor and is an old disease, then cauterize twice with two cautery instruments over the furcula in the recessed places around the tonsils; and another cautery in the middle of the foot between two nipples; and make the cautery like a claw as mentioned above.
And if you wish, make the punctures with the pointed cautery that is called punctate, the shape of which you have seen in the puncture of heel pain
And take care that you puncture within cavities as well as above; and take care of that which is before until it is healed
And already three ramps have been made that the cautery has to be done in this way: in one bite you can make three cauteries as described above.
Chapter XXV
Of the cautery of the titulus which is the head of the assistant
When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to greasy humors and is not fixed at the time of the setting of the sun must be reduced within it until it is at the time when it usually returns, and in order to do so for a little movement it is loosened thus as we have testified, the hours that must be taken is that you must first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient must be reversed over the seat or over the side of the bed; and then lift the chin which is in the front part of the titulus to the parts under your left hand, if the dislocation is at the front part.
And immediately ignite the cautery with two caps; this is the way to do it.

When cold humors infiltrate the stomach and bring about vomiting and moisture, which multiply the humors, and if you continue your treatment without relieving the cause, then it is necessary to place the patient on their side with their knees and chest raised, and extend their hands and feet, and immediately ignite the cautery with three caps: on one cautery leave the patient’s toes for the amount of one finger at the level of the thumb, and on the two cauteries leave the two sides of the cautery, until the triangular shape of the cautery appears; and stretch out those that are not adjusted, which will cause the swelling to reduce.

And thus you can cauterize with a pointed cautery, when you see fit and with prudence in the art.
Beware that you do not proceed too much in the cauterization, and that you respect the entirety of the limb so that the whole body is cauterized and the humors reach the bones; for the limb here is subtle; know this well.</start_of_turn>

Of perforation of the abscess of the foot with cautery.</start_of_turn
When swelling or abscess in the foot occurs and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the foot or in its membrane, if it is in the flesh of the foot, the disease is severe and the pain is acute.</start_of_turn
And if it is in the membrane of the foot, the pain is great and often the doctors are already exhausted in caring for it.</start_of_turn
Therefore the patient must be placed on the stretcher; and then draw out the abscess with your hand; and then cauterize the wound with the cautery which is composed of rags, as we shall explain later.</start_of_turn And cauterize thus until all the limb is well cauterized, until the bone is reached, until it is well healed.</start_of_turn
And take care of the other abscesses until they are healed.</start_of_turn
And do not use this method of cautery except when studied in the art of medicine for a long time, and in most of which there are many diseases which are known; for in this method there are some risks which are to be known, even though we have experience with it in other operations; but read carefully what we must tell you, for it is safer.</start_of_turn

And thus immerse that in oil and heat that in the fire, and then cauterize for a cautery in that place which is between the continuation of the furcula with the ribs; and with two small cauteries let two guides be left, one slightly declining towards the part which is beyond the beard, and two cauteries downwards between the fifth rib and the twelfth, declining slightly towards the back; and another cauterization in the middle of the foot; and another over the stomach, and three cauterizations from the back parts; and one in that place which is between the two scapulae, and two cauteries from the two flanks of the foot, leaving the cautery which is between two scapulae.</start_of_turn
And do not touch your hand to the cautery, but rather keep your hand in work.</start_of_turn

And another manner of cauterizing is that you ignite the cautery having two assistants, which we have mentioned in the chapter of dislocation of the muscle, and draw up the limb which is in the belly of the spleen towards the flank of the patient without breaking the bone.
And elevate the limb to the height of the patient's shoulder, so that the burns caused by the cautery are in proportion to the width of the body.
And insert two lancets, ignite one, in that place where it penetrates the shoulder of the other side
And extract the cautery; thus are four burns made.
And if you wish, burn at the cautery without three lancets.
Then keep the burn covered until it has lost its tendency to swell, which is different from other preceding conditions in the treatment.

From the cautery of the heel towards the base of the toes, in order to remove the swelling.
When you have incised the heel, then do you ignite the cautery so that it is like a ray. Return the ignited cautery between the heel and the base of the toe, and stop your hand until it reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows out.
And do two incisions, if you see that the wound is gaping, then cauterize each one as much as we have recounted, and take care of those which are around it so that they do not suffer from the heat until it is healed.

Like a ray. And put the ignited cautery into this fistula, and according to the quantity of the tissue which you must penetrate
And do this until you have burned up those corrupt tissues for a while, two or three times, according to the quantity of your need
Beware of burning nerves and veins; or if the fistula is in the bladder or the belly, then take care of all those parts; and do not do anything else until the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it is not penetrating
And take care of the place until it is healed.
And if the place is sealed, and if you have removed from it the matter, and you remain like this for a long time, then know that it is already healed entirely
And if the matter is not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating or in the preparation of doing so, or that it comes from those causes from which it will remind you in its place.

De cauterizacio de la dislocacio de l’anqua.
When moist mucus humors are spread throughout the ankle joint, and causes swelling of the limb, the sign is that the swelling is prolonged on the other side when compared with the normal. The place of dislocation is found at the point where the bones touch.
Therefore when you cauterize the disease on the ankle with a pointed cautery, do so in a circular fashion so that you do not tear the surrounding tissue, and so that the surrounding parts do not suffer damage.
And the cautery which precedes this should be of the same form as the cautery of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at hand, then do three cauteries with olive oil.
And do the cautery according to the quantity of spiciness of the whole area; and take care that it is healed correctly.

The next text is about cauterizing the sciatic vein.
When there is pain in the ankle area, caused by cold and moisture, the disease is cured with what has been said before and not confirmed, and when it is old, that you must remove the moisture of the humors with solid pills or with artificial or similar pills; and then cauterize that area.
And the manner of cautery in this case is in two ways: either with medicinal substances that are comburents, or with fire.
The second way is that you make three triangular cauteries on the ankle bone at this point, and do them with good depth. And the space between each cautery should be the size of the thickness of the finger, and if you use olive oil or grease
Some people put the cautery on the lower part of the ankle above the ankle bone so that there are four cauteries in total
Or do the cautery in the circle that precedes the form of the ankle dislocation, and make it continuous and consume the spiciness of the whole area
This is the manner of cautery for the sciatica when the pain is attached to the ankle and is not extended to the swelling.
If it is extended to the swelling, then do two cauteries on the swelling on the limb where the pain is, and one cautery on the heel for four fingers a little beyond the wrist
And if the cautery is too deep, and the depth of the cautery is according to the quantity of spiciness of the area
If the disease sends that the pain is extended to the foot bones, then do three or four cauteries here where the pain is sent as well as there.
If the disease sends pain that can be seen outside the swelling, then do one deep cautery here.
And take care in all cauterizations that you do not burn nerves or large vessels, and that for this reason you must be careful not to damage the disease or contract anything.
And I have seen others who have cauterized on the heel and finished the cautery, and the limb was so inflamed that the tumor almost reached the heel, and the limb was perforated and corrupted throughout Therefore apply a strong vinegar solution from the belly, and do the same with wine.
And if the pain is in two parts do each one according to this manner.
And the learned men say that the best way of cauterizing the ankle is to make a circle of iron whose circumference is the size of half a palm; and the depth of the burn should be according to the thickness of the date stone or less
And put another third in; and let the space between them be the size of the nail of the thumb; and these circles should be close together, and the length of these incisions should be a nail or two, and do in these marks of iron diligently around the circles; and this is the form of it.
And do the fire in the firebox until it is covered in ash and sparks are seen, and do hold it still over the ankle, the disease is placed on the side of the ankle. Therefore, cauterize with three cauteries around the area in a circle.
And so leave it for three days; then plaster that area around the edges and leave the wound open for several days; and finally care for that area until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

And so place your hand over the ankle of the patient, over the side of the foot; and press your hand over the ankle; and take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and the quality of that which is in the circle is like that of small fire, and do that for the quantity of an hour, and suffer the pain of the patient the bite and the swelling of it — for that other bite like fire — until the bite ceases.
And so raise your hand with the instrument and wash the warm water from the entire ankle with cold water.</end_of_turn>
And so leave it for three days and place your hand over that border until the blackness of the swelling has gone, and leave it for a few days, and come back to see if it has disappeared; this is the end of treatment.</end_of_turn
Finally care for that area until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if the pain is extended to the thigh or the leg, make it stay in that place which contains water as is done in the ankle swelling.</end_of_turn
This is the way of warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.</end_of_turn> Recipe of alkali and caustic not extinct of both parts, one part each, and grind them and leave them in a new wave of which the part left should be perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that enters into it.</end_of_turn
And leave the bottom of the wave another wave coming, and take over that alkali and caustic alive from lukewarm water which you take by a thumb, and when you have grasped those with your thumb for a good compression, and leave the rest that comes from the acute water in the left part to the wave coming.</end_of_turn
And so adjust all that water, and take another live caustic and another renewed alkali, for that which in the hours if it be put in strong acute, which is administered in surgical operations of medicine and in cauterization of the other members, for that operation is like fire.</end_of_turn
And so of the many medicines which are cauterized widely, some are like tartar and alum, and caustic like sulfur which are mixed together.</end_of_turn
And so relates a a man of antiquity the operation and care which is made for the pain of the ankle and sciatica, and magnifies it much better to say that no other care is necessary, and that it is healed for a whole week in this way, as it is recommended, for that strong thread is bound in a bath and indeed it is said to have already healed from that.</end_of_turn
And it is that it is taken of certain green herbs, and if it is not found green, take it fresh; and do not grind it with a little gray, but leave it whole on the ankle where the pain is, or in the thigh or the leg, and bind it.</end_of_turn
And let it be left for the quantity of three hours or for the quantity that the patient feels the swelling subside.</end>
And so put that in a bath and therefore when the body of the limb is bruised, remove that from the sun, for the pain ceases and it is healed.</end>
Remember that not all use these cauteries with these medicines except for the evacuation of the limb.</end_of_turn>
More I have written that when there is a wound of a goat the stretched vein is cauterized, take advantage of that well; and let the cauteries be made in this manner: take wool and soak it in olive oil and leave it between the toes of the foot and between the heel.
And thus take a dry goat horn and burn that which is in its mouth until it is burnt through; and then place it on the wound and read over it until it is fully extended. And do thus again, and do not cease until the sensation of the bite reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.</end_of_turn>

And do not burn except in this single kind which is useful for the effusion of hot matter.</end_of_turn
Therefore cover, do evacuate the patient with pillows fixed and similar to them, that they are useful about the two in which the pain is three lines according to their breadth, because otherwise they may be burnt in some line or on the cautery or elsewhere, according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance and the virtue of the cautery.</end_of_turn
And let the cautery be useful with the pointed cautery.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, burn with three cauteries or with four in the middle according to this manner:

Of the cautery at the beginning of gangrene.</end_of_turn>
These diseases often accompany this ailment in young children; and a sign of the beginning of this in children is that it happens to them in the heel and the elevation and movement are hindered.</end_of_turn
And in the back it is seen that the bone of the heel is already beginning to dominate over the other bones.</end_of_turn
And therefore when you see that it is necessary and you wish to prohibit it, then burn that which is circular according to this manner:</end_of_turn that covers the entire part of the bone equally.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, burn around the bone with the pointed cautery two lines or three.</end_of_turn And let the points be close to each other.</end_of_turn
And take care of the area until it is healed with the water that we have said.</end_of_turn
Beware that the cautery is not administered in gangrene that is useful for the spasm of nerves.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of gout and joint pain.</end_of_turn
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</end_of_turn
And therefore when gout is cured by means of treatment and the pain is not repeated, the cautery is not repeated.</end_of_turn
And it is that you burn around the evacuation in the circuit of the ankle bone with more cauteries.</end_of_turn
And let the cautery be olive oil of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</end_of_turn And if the pain rises within the bones or in the other joints, and when these things are seen to be necessary, then burn over each painful area with three cauteries or over the entire area with this olive oil cautery.</end_of_turn
And if more cauteries are necessary than these, then do burn with greater care and do not touch the cautery too much before, neither only with the point but also with the handle of the cautery.</end_of_turn
And if the pain arises within the bone and the heel, then administer the cautery that we have said in the previous chapter.</end_of_turn
And if the pain is only in the toes and is urgent, then puncture in the circle of the nails as if it were a wheel, puncture in those two lines.</end_of_turn
If pain persists in the toes, the doctor punctures the circumference of the bones every night and on the pinch of the hand.
If pain continues to linger for several days in the joints or muscles, the doctor cauterizes them throughout their entirety
Do not evacuate the patient from good order and reception of medicines, for if it is good order and inflammation, it is evacuated with this pointed cautery without danger, God help us.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn>
Of cautery of fractures.</end_of_turn>
When a fracture has occurred in the ankle and saying the bones are tender before the hernia, and when this begins to approach, the doctor must order the patient to lie still in bed and to use soft supports so that the wound does not open from the belly button.</end_of_turn
And then follow the patient between your thighs on the bed, and command them to keep their thigh bones inside until the hernia is retrieved or the hernia or the intestine appears.
And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity and signal the fracture on the fifth bone by indicating the limb that appears similar to a half circle of the upper parts of the body.</end_of_turn>
And then make the cautery in this way:
until it is soft and gives a tingling sensation.</end_of_turn Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</end_of_turn
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And then pause the cautery on that signal with your hand on the cautery, and when you have driven the fracture into the middle of the bone; repeat this until you have achieved it in the first attempt on the bone.</end_of_turn
And observe wisely the condition of the intestine during the cautery, that you do not burn the intestine so that there does not result in death or other great harm to the patient.</end_of_turn>
And remember that when you have finished the cautery do not neglect the bone, do not confer your operation.</end_of_turn
And cover that the cautery of the children should be subtle according to their age and measure.</end_of_turn
And take care of the place of the cautery for three days with a border until the wound of the fire is healed.</end_of_turn
And take care of those who are with inflammation until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And the patient should rest on the bed for forty days until the wound and the swelling are sealed.</end_of_turn
And cover that you suspend the food of the patient according to the length of time of the treatment of the which it covers the belly of the patient, and that the intestine does not come out due to the effort to recover.</end_of_turn
And when it is time to take the patient away after forty days, the doctor must administer medicine properly for another forty days.
And be careful of work and of replenishment of food and drink, and of harsh words, for when you use this regimen of treatment entirely you will find the patient completely healed.</end_of_turn
And I say the treatment of fractures in other parts of the belly, and so at the beginning, and you must not neglect, the doctor must cauterize the fracture round as much as necessary; and this is what is ejected from the cavity as well as a third part of it; and take care of that which we have said, and do not adjust it.</end_of_turn
And I have already said that the first fracture must be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this way, because it is signaled with a tremor.</end_of_turn
and it is stopped like that for the width of the limb beyond the fracture, and another line at the heel; and hold your hand with a claw cautery, for the first cautery is more painful and better.</end_of_turn
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn
Of cautery of torsion.</end_of_turn
When pain persists in various parts of the body due to an accident or percussion, and the pain does not subside with medication, it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
The cautery should be applied to the entire limb according to its size, its toughness and flexibility, its twisting and pain sensation
Therefore, if the first cautery does not suffice, repeat it several times; for it is often from these punctures that pain originates, in order to ensure that the pain is relieved when the ailment is cured

On cauterization for leprosy
Many books speak of cautery for great benefit, but it should not be used for the species of leprosy that causes putrefaction of fat and melancholy.
Therefore, when you wish to cauterize, consider whether the leprosy is acute or chronic and cured with what we have said in the division, neither too little nor too much; and fear lest the corruption should embrace the whole body and its completeness, for then cauterize on the head with three cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and two at the sides, and on the forehead above the eyebrows; and two at the back, over the nape of the neck or on the shoulder.
And finally, lay your hand over the cautery for a moment until a slight blistering appears on the bone, and from that the scales will be loosened; so that the expulsion of thick vapor is alleviated from them; and cauterize on the belly as required
If the leprosy has already spread over the body and is evident, it is necessary to cauterize in addition to the previous cauteries mentioned in the head; and on the tip of the nose, and two on the two cheekbones, and two on two vertebrae of the neck, and five on the vertebrae of the chest, and one on the chest near the shoulder, and two on the wrists, and two on the thumbs, and two on the knuckles, and two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of the thighs; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on all the nails of the feet and on the teeth of the patient
And beware of the nerves that are above the ankle so that you do not burn them.
Many are cauterized with a cautery on the fifth toe bone and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the heel
Remember that the more cauteries you make, the greater the benefit and the greater the safety; and remember that the body is already stupefaied when there is no pain in the cautery, just as if they had never been applied
And know that the cauteries should be large or small according to the limb and the joints as it precedes the species of instruments
And take care that the cautery is well bound with a piece of cloth or bandage and with another care that it is not too tight
End of Book.
On cauterization for stupor
When any limb is stiff or sleeping and is cured with medicines, oils and plasters, and is not cured, then you cauterize the stiff limb with cauteries as it deserves according to the greatness of the limb or the smallness of it
And do the cautery on the testis entering the testicles a little And take care of that which is within until it is cured
And some are cauterized every stupor that comes from the head and the feet, from the vertebrae of the neck and see the loosening of the nerves that are causing that limb, and it is remapped the stupor
Do not presume more than what is known in the anatomy of the limb and the exit of the nerves throughout the body

On the cauterization of gangrene that is rotting
When gangrene is old and does not yield to the application of medical remedies, then you cauterize on that which is cauterized before a little according to the quantity of the matter within that the white becomes gray and the color turns to black.
And take care of that which is of the earth and of lentils with olive oil and marjoram leaves, with columb or vinegar, give each a little and mix them all together, and keep it covered with a bandage and hold it in place until it is cured
Capital. Libertas.
Capital. Freedom. From burnings.
When cancer begins and wants to devour that limb, then cauterize that part with a pointed instrument around the circumference as it is twisted.
And say the learned men that it is cauterized behind the heel in the middle area; however, to me it is not seen that it is ulcerated, for I have seen several veins.
And it is better to cauterize around the circumference as I have said, or by cautery.
Freedom. Twice
From burnings of the bones.
When some bones are delayed in maturation, and this is due either to excessive fatness or for the state of the patient, who is old in decrepitude, or for little rest, or for the time, and you want to hasten the maturation of bones; then cauterize around the circumference with small punctures; and immediately say that which is fasting in maturation
However, if you want to make a perforation around the circumference, then do so with the instrument from which this is the form of the cautery; and suspend that in the middle of the bones of the bones that enter the marrow.
And if you burn in that place that is more, in order that the limb is relieved; and immediately care for that until it is healed.
Freedom. Twice
From burnings of the teeth
The tooth is a mobile corruption in the limb, which consumes that as if with fire like burning dry wood
Therefore, if sometimes that corruption is in the place where you suffer from the cautery with fire, then do you cauterize the nails a few, as it is convenient in that place where it is corrupted.
And immediately cauterize all around until you have eradicated the whole corruption and there remains no cause of it.
And immediately say that for three days, and suspend on the cauterized places until three days have passed with olive oil mixed so that the scars are completely eradicated and the whole corruption is gone.
And immediately care for that which is engendered by the flesh
However, if for three times three days that the flesh should grow healthy in which there is no corruption, it is not so; however, if not, then immediately repeat the cautery over that which is broken in the corrupted places
And the tooth is treated in many ways with acute medicine, which is half in place of the cautery. However, fire cautery is more useful in many ways.
And I have already said the treatment of them with acute medicine in the division, and therefore take that when there is an abundance of it
Freedom. Three times
From burnings of nails and of the like things
Many veins that are seen outside the foot are diseased in the lower parts of the foot that is called claw, and this is a great cause, made, which comes from there; and the cautery is done in two ways, one with fire and the other with cold water
However, fire cautery is more so that you ignite the cautery instrument like punishment of a wound, which is made of iron according to the quantity which the claw contains throughout, and of slight stripes
And immediately suspend that ignition on the claw, and immediately turn your hand over the cautery around the circumference of the claw until the cautery reaches the depth of the claw. And say that for three days until the limb starts to recover And immediately plaster that which is raw and bleeding with salt, and say the plaster over that for a night, for that will be eradicated from its root
And immediately care for that which is engendered of the flesh until it is healed
And if it does not recover, and many veins have been seen to happen on the surface of the limb, mainly in the feet, then you must know that you must administer in those cauteries with cold water, for take a little bundle of wool or iron or punishment of a wound, and suspend that on the claw; and immediately put some cold water over the bundle of wool, and keep your hand, and turn that over on compression of your hand all around, and press the margin of the bundle against the root of the claw, and hold the cold water away from the root of the claw; and wait for the patient for a while for the pain of the cold water to pass for an hour, and then remove that, for the claw will have been eradicated from its root
And thus we must enter with one hand into those which we have just opened until we come over all of them throughout the body.
And we must take care of those whose roots are eradicated with the incisions so that the flesh does not suffer from their emergence.</end_of_turn>

Of cautery of tremor.</end_of_turn
When indeed an ulcer trembles from cold in the nerves or from excessive heat, or from another similar cause, then you must cauterize in four places or more over the vertebrae of the two, between each vertebra with a cautery; and on the feet of the patient, and over their stomach, with olive oil.</end_of_turn

And sometimes it is cauterized somewhat at the beginning of its discharge in this manner; and do not be surprised, for the excess is broken and the swelling is reduced thereby.</end_of_turn

Of cautery of the flux of blood from an accidental wound by incision of an artery.</end_of_turn
Many times there is a flux of blood from an artery which is incised behind the plaque which must be excised, or behind the incision of apostemas or cautery of the limb, and in this way it is difficult to control it.</end_of_turn
Therefore when such a thing happens to you, then immediately you must cover with your hand the orifice of the artery, and pause for a moment over that place where you have indicated, and hold in place until all the blood has drained from the wound, and that it does not escape.</end_of_turn
And immediately stop the bleeding by applying a few coarse and fine cauteries, in number as many as necessary, and uncover those until they are no longer inflamed.</end_of_turn
And immediately take hold of those with a little or a great one according to the place and the wound in which the artery is broken, over that vein firmly holding back the bleeding until it has clotted, and cauterize until it is healed and that bleeding has ceased.</end_of_turn
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you have held back the bleeding and squeezed the cauteries, then take another cautery immediately covering the previous ones which are in the fire, and therefore do not cease until the blood has clotted.</end_of_turn
And take care that you do not burn the nerves which are here, and that you come over the patient with another disease.</end_of_turn
And you must know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to restrict the blood flow, and more when the artery is large, if there is not one of four methods: or to cauterize as we have said, or to extract it when not extracted, or when extracted the limbs are burned and the blood is clotted, or that it be bound with thread or a ligature to make a strong structure, or that they be held with powders or astringents.</end_of_turn
May those who administer decent restriction of the thread and stricture with a bandage or for the position of causes which burn and prevent, do not grieve but rather rejoice.</end_of_turn
May he also say that if this happens to you and the physician is not present or the medicine is not available, then open immediately at the orifice of that vein as we have said, and understand with great care that the bleeding must stop before the wound is finally healed; and that the artery must not be clotted; and that over the artery must be poured a strong cold water until the blood is clotted and thickened; and do whatever is necessary to cauterize or to use medicine.</end_of_turn
From incision and perforation and winds and from phlebotomy and from plagues and from swellings and from their appearances.
We have already said in the first chapter that in all diseases in which the pointed cautery is convenient and the medicine is combatant, and the occasions and the causes of them, and the instruments necessary for them, and the forms of the cautery; and we have ordered the chapters of the subchapter to the feet
And I will proceed in this chapter in that way, so that what you desire may be relieved, whenever you demand it
And since I am beginning this, know that in this chapter is for terror what is in the first chapter of cautery
And because of that I say that great care must be taken in this operation, because in it are evacuated the things which are in the great danger of causing death, such as the bursting of the vein or perforation of the abscess or excision or extraction of the tumor or opening of the wound or cutting of the bone and their like. And all of these are accompanied by fear and tremor and in most of them death.
And I warn you that you must not fall into that which is the state of things, for in some cases negligence may cause you to act in a manner worthy of men of low character rather than of men of great maladies And it is from this that some will go mad with their disease and will be glad to die rather than bear the burden of their disease, and will be filled with fear of the disease itself, and of the fear of death which it brings.
And concerning these things I say to you, do not hope for that healing, and do not speak of it, for your expectation of healing will be pernicious.
Therefore do not consent to that which is done to you of which you are speaking; and your care should be greater than your desire, and your speed greater still; and do not presume any cause except for that which you know with certainty is the cause of your disease, and of which you are sure that it will bring about a beneficial result.
Use in the treatment of all these maladies the prognosis and the indication of which is the greatest health benefit, for in that lies your help in the acquisition of fame and memory, of love and glory
Oh, children, God be with you and do not fear to listen to my direction and my protection, for it is in his hand.
And I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by chapters according to the order of the chapter of cautery, of the care of the head to the feet, so that what you desire and what you have need of may be alleviated from you.

Of the care of the water which is contained in the head of childhood.</end_turn>
You know that this disease does not depart from childhood until it has finished with the head of the child when the new maid begins to nurse the child when she gives birth to the head of the child.
And every negligence is for a hidden cause which is not known
I do not see this disease except in childhood; and in all those whom I have seen it, death has been hidden by it, and for this reason I say that I have seen it left undone in these cases.</end_turn
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, the head of which was always swelling up until Caesar could not place his hand over it because of its greatness, and that the humidity increased until it brought about death.
And this humidity is either added to the bone and the marrow, or is added outside the bones over the brain
For if the humidity is between the bone and the marrow and the abscess is little, then you must make a wound in the middle of the head with a fissure two fingers wide, until the humidity runs out, and this is the form of the wound:
And if the humidity is greatly increased and the abscess is large, then you must make two wounds according to this manner
And if the humidity is outside the bones, a sign of this is that you often consume the food of the head open to the whole and the water is squeezed out when you press with your thumb against the parts surrounding it and it is not water that you have hidden Therefore make three wounds in the middle of the head according to this manner
And thus extract all the humidity; strengthen the fissures with drapes and feathers; and apply vinegar and oil for five days; then remove the ligament and heal the wound with attempts and warmth, and strengthen the head equally; and feed the patient dry food of little humidity until the limb is comforted and healed.
Another method of incision is to consider the magnitude of the swelling and the collection of fluid, which sometimes occurs in the occipital region, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; therefore pay attention to the incision where the swelling appears and the fluid is collected, and do so as much as possible.
Note that you should not incision the artery and ensure that blood flows freely from the wound and relieve the patient of pain by evacuating the fluid with the discharge of humidity.
End of book/document second chapter
When an ulcer or tumor appears on the hands or feet, and the matter is old, do not rely on water for treatment; rather the true treatment in this case is the incision of those two arteries
Therefore cover when you want to make the incision so that the patient does not feel pain; and strengthen the edge of the wound with rough materials so that the arteries appear, and strengthen the patient's head with some material; and consider where the vein is positioned; and the places where some of the arteries that are near the ankles are depressed, and cover them so that they do not appear
And do the same with the surrounding area with attempts, and make incisions in the area of some sharp object at the start of the incision to reach the bone, and do so for the width of the head
And if you wish, remove the surrounding tissue and tie the artery at the incisions of the surrounding parts
And the length of the incision should be two fingers adjusted, because when any artery is incised, the blood is ejected with a pulsatile emission, which jumps for jumps frequently
If the artery does not appear on examination, cover that you have measured three finger-widths of the ankle, and do the same with attempts, and reach the bone
And what comes out of the blood is an amount of wine unc and it is strong blood that comes out of it more or less, and all this is according to the amount that appears of the virtue of the patient and the collection of the artery of the patient
And consider the wound, and therefore if there remains anything on the bone concerning the swelling, the hour to incision is to prevent further swelling.
And strengthen the wound with feathers and silk thread, and take care of that which is inflamed until it is healed

On the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples
When an old accident occurs in the temples, or some acute wound, due to agricultural humidity or for the quality of the lacerations of the temples, or old wounds that resemble these, and when these are not treated with the methods of medical care and water, we must resort to these diseases in the extraction of the arteries of the temples, or the cauterization of these veins as we have shown
The manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient lies in the position in which they are in the temples; and understand that the artery that appears in the temple is the one that you have shown to be the cause of the pain, and that it is hidden only in a few people due to its intensity of heat
If it is hidden, then strengthen the patient's head with some material; and strengthen the edge of the wound with a rough material or evacuate the edge of the wound with cold water until the artery appears clearly And thus take the surrounding tissue of which this is the form: And thus hold the cord with that which facilitates that the artery is reached; and take away from it what is above and extract that from the surrounding parts until you have extracted that from the cord and uncover that from the tunics which are left behind, from all parts
And if the artery is small, then surround that with the tip of the nail, and make incisions of that part according to the quantity for which the tips of the nails are elongated and contracted, and do not cause bleeding, because if they are not incised they will not heal the blood of all
And quickly evacuate from the sacred vessel one cubic. And immediately evacuate from the sacred vessel one cubic inch.</start_of_turn>
And if the wound is large, then cover that with two layers of lint firmly doubled or with silk threads of considerable length, and do not neglect to keep it from putrefying before the consolidation of the plague and the evacuation of blood.</start_of_turn
And immediately apply the excessive [fluid] that is between two ligaments; and do this at that moment or almost at another.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize that with a pointed cautery within the bone that is pointed outwards until the extremities of the limb have been cauterized, and leave in place of that useless work.</start_of_turn
And it is better for the patient if the illness has fever or is of scaly complication; for the cautery is of those causes that help the drying humors, and therefore is better in judgment.</start_of_turn
And cover immediately the extraction of the arteries that you see in the area of the knee, and keep them covered with fine dust, and immediately administer either dry medications or apply cold compresses until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn
And if while working you see further outflow of blood from the artery, then immediately restrain that blood, or cauterize, or that you fill the area of the knee, and press your hand over that area until the bleeding is stopped.</start_of_turn And if none of those causes are present, then immediately suspend the procedure until the blood has congealed, and then apply cold water of great coldness to the area until the pain has ceased, and strengthen as much as you can.</start_of_turn
And what is more curious in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein at this point having two handles, because you have marked the two places at the attempt, and withdraw somewhat, without lighting, until you reach the bone and split the vein in two places, so that it is elongated between the extremities that are not consolidated by this cautery.</start_of_turn
This is the form of the cautery:</start_of_turn
And the acuteness of the two handles is equal.</start_of_turn Better yet if you have less acute than two handles, for if you have them too acute close to anything, you will burn the flesh too quickly.</start_of_turn
Therefore when there is any thickness, keep the heat of the fire in those [areas] and the flesh will be cleanly separated.</start_of_turn
This work is better in all work and lighter.</start_of_turn
And the space between the two handles is the quantity of the thickness of the finger.</start_of_turn

From the care of the limbs affected by sharp and acidic ulcers of the humors.
When there are acidic humors, and it is a limb affected by those veins which are above the cap of the femur, and you do not care for any cause of the medical treatment, and sometimes the face of the patient already swells up and sits in front of the walk like a walk of ants, and the limbs of that limb are extended, moist because they have already been known, and the nails are scaled by the sharpness of the tears, the former treatments that were useful for the treatment of those operations are now useless.</start_of_turn
And you command the patient to draw out the nails that are in the heel, and immediately make three incisions equally distant according to the length of the front.</start_of_turn And if the length of the incision is two fingers: one incision is equally distant to the length of the nose in the middle of the front, and the second according to the length a little of the movement of the tears that are in the lacrimal, and the third from the other side.</start_of_turn<end_turn>
And keep your hand away from the incision of the arteries which are in two places, and lengthen your hand from the continuation of both mandibles.</start_of_turn And if the space of any incision is the quantity of three fingers adjusted.</start_of_turn
And if you have a sponge pad or dry cloth moist with those which you can absorb the blood.</start_of_turn
And immediately place between the palm of two sharp extremities, from which this is the form of the incision of them:</start_of_turn That it is from the first part of the temple up to the second incision. Excise from that whole area which is between two incisions over the bone, and do so with the point of the incision moving from the first incision to the second incision And do the same with this sponge and put inside the first incision another vessel or instrument, which is called the cutellar, somewhat blunt on one side and sharp on the other side.</start_of_turn>
And stop the bleeding of that sharp instrument which is over the flesh of the limb, and the bleeding of the bone does not go down to the heel, and fill that up until it reaches the fissure that moves, and cut away all the vessels that go from the head to the heel.</start_of_turn
Maybe the incision should be continued up to that part of the limb, and do so with the point of the incision in the middle of the fissure between the two incisions.</start_of_turn
And when the bleeding has ceased of its own accord, express the wound of the limb with sponges.
And do the same with any old wound that is callous, and cover those dusts with vinegar, oil and wine vinegar, and whatever does not adhere after cautery.</start_of_turn
And on the third day remove the ligament and give great abundance of warm water or tepid, and do so with the point of the cautery over ointment of beeswax with olive oil and other things that will make the wounds heal.</start_of_turn

Concerning the care of wounds of the limbs that descend from the parts that are below the head.</start_of_turn
When some violent catarrh exists and continues, and sometimes the limbs of the patient extend slightly, and since regarding them it is necessary to show moderation, their ulcers and their pus are to be regarded as matters of great importance, and in the front of the head there is acute pain of the teeth and subsequent vomiting, which are the result of these accidents that the substances and catarrh do not go down but by blood vessels from the parts that are below.</start_of_turn
And the best care for these is this: that you command the patient to keep his face still, and do an incision in the middle of the face, a little for the width (and begin with the incision of the left temporal until the right temporal; and let the incision be from the temporal bone to the bone; and lengthen your hand from the lacerations of the temples which are gnawed by chewing), until the bone is exposed.</start_of_turn
Excise all the wound with sponge or dry gauze and do so between the two lips of the incision with old wax or linen cloth.</start_of_turn And do the same with dusts covered in vinegar and oil so that it does not adhere after cautery.</start_of_turn
And when you remove it and see that the swelling has already diminished, the time has come to cover the bone until it begins to become soft, and do so with the point of the cautery as if you were taking two barley grains and four barley grains and mixing them, or doing something like that, and make a plaster and administer it to these wounds that are of soft tissue.</start_of_turn

Regarding the care of what is catarrhal in the ankles.</start_of_turn
Every cause that causes catarrh in the ankles is of four kinds, either a mineral pebble or something that simulates a pebble, such as iron and gravel, or of plant origin such as chaff or beans, or of a fluid origin such as vinegar and wine vinegar and similar things.</start_of_turn
And therefore when a pebble causes catarrh in the ankle or any other cause that does not fit or grow in the ankle, and if sometimes the pebble is discharged in any of these causes by olive oil or by vomit, do so with the point of the cautery, and make it vomit with condiment, and wash the area around the event of vomiting.</start_of_turn And do the same with some pieces of cloth or gauze around the ankle and stretch the ankle towards the parts above, because the swelling caused by these causes is soft-yielding.</start_of_turn
And if it is not soft-yielding, do so with the extraction of the ankle using the instrument called epicicarios subtle which is like this:
And if it is soft-yielding with the thumb, it is good; but if not, do so with the extraction of the ankle using an ointment of little duplication.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if it is not urgent, make a needle of gut and insert the extremity of the needle into the space between the tarsal bones and close around the needle with wax and olive oil to prevent anything but the needle from coming out. And if you have extracted with the gut string with great attraction, which troops have seen as much as we who have recounted.
May be if it is not urgently done in this manner, then take a pinch of alum or vinegar and apply it to the area with which the boils are present, and let the patient rest for a while in that extremity, and then cover the area adequately with a bandage And insert it into the space between the tarsal bones easily, and immediately remove the moisture from the area
Therefore, if it is not urgently necessary in all of the causes that we have recounted, then you must order that the patient be treated with cautery or spasm for the pain that is left over after the other treatments.
And the way to treat this is to cauterize the phlegmas of the vein of the foot and extract the abscess according to the virtue of the herbs, and then make an incision between your thumbs and convert the heel to the parts below, and do not make a large incision in the heel, but rather a small fissure in the heel where the abscess is located, and leave the heel gray in the place before and after the treatment. And the wound should be of a crescent shape until it reaches the nail, and when the nail is grasped, hold it with appropriate instruments; and immediately close the wound at that moment, and care for it until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if the cause of the pain is one of the fats that grows and inflates, then administer the care and extraction of these; even if you do not obey your order immediately, the physician will take spontaneous action according to this form: give an incision to that fat which is causing the pain in the heel.</start_turn>
Do not be afraid when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the heel, and rest in soft matters, and we will extract it with nails or with instruments, or by incision as we have said, for the extraction is alleviated.</start_turn
But in the water that is introduced into the heel cover that the pain uses to emit at the beginning, and fill the heel cavity with some old cloth, and keep that heel on the water, and if because of that it is urgent, do not be afraid; but if not, take troops of nails and leeches according to the length of the toe, and tie them in the heel for a little while, and the patient will put one of those into the space between the heel and jump on the other foot over that part and strike with the other foot on the foot that is causing the heel pain.</start_turn Therefore do not stop until all the water is gone.</start_turn
Therefore do not stop until all the water is gone.</start_turn And when the water is finally gone, take paper or gauze.</start_turn and put one extremity into the heel and extend the other extremity over the fire until the majority of the pain is gone.</start_turn
And put the other gauze and do it so until all the water is gone, and then remove the painful part with a needle as we have said, which is called the extracting needle.</start_turn>
But in the extraction of beasts that enter that heel, if it is small, praise and hold it still, care for it as we have said in the division; but if it is of great size which causes pain at the same time, the physician will administer the extraction with nails and instruments, and the cause of this is less severe than all the other causes that cause pain in the heel.</start_turn
But in the extraction of worms that are engendered in the heel, when you have cured that which we have said in the division and in the treatise of distillations, and do not fear your cure, the physician will cover that the patient must go out into the sunlight.</start_turn
Therefore, if there appears any cause of the worms, the physician will extract that with nails or fine needles, but if no cause appears, the physician will take a needle and make a hole of sufficient size for it: And insert the pointed extremity of the needle into the heel according to the quantity that the pain suffers; and immediately put on that for pressure, and do it so until all the worms are gone.</start_turn
But if you do not obey my order immediately, the physician will apply an ointment and close the opening of the needle with wax as we have said; the physician will administer distillations which have already been prepared in the treatment of the worms, and will find that in the treatise of distillations.</start_turn
The physician's effusion is at the origin of the odors of medicines in the heel with this instrument. Then make an incision of silver or lead, leaving a small tract, and place a pledget therein.</end_of_turn>
And thus proceed as is customary when the canula of containment is in the curvature here where it is necessary.</end_of_turn> And if you wish, take the rag and wrap it around the lower part of the limb adequately, and pour oil onto the cavity of the wound, or juice of any herb, or any other medicine you wish in the canula — and that is in the heel — and then put the rag back onto the limb and press with your hand that which is pressing in a temperate manner until the oil is expelled from the cavity of the wound and the patient feels the oil remaining in the wound.
And when it is infiltrated in the heel, it is already scorched with fire a little.</end_of_turn> And take care that the cause from which you distill in the heel is not too hot, because the medicines of the heel do not suffer from that.</end_of_turn
Chapter VII.</end_of_turn>
Of the care of the ointment of the heels.</end_of_turn>
Some girls and even some women of greater age do not perforate their bellies, and when it has already happened in some men, ointment in the meat of the heel for pleasure or for nothing in particular; and this ointment is sometimes useful in the groin of the heel which does not always happen, and sometimes in the outer parts.</end_of_turn
And that which happens in the groin of the heel, which does not always happen, is in the greatest precautions of difficult healing.</end_of_turn
And in that in which you can make it happen, cover that you keep the heel of the patient towards the sun and rest in that.</end_of_turn And thus if sometimes the ointment appears, open that with a fine spatula of which this is the form.</end_of_turn
If the limb in which it is small has a narrowness, of which one side is acute and the other is not; and the spatula is of two lion heads so that it does not make a wound in the heel.</end_of_turn
And thus if the ointment is for nothing born in the heel or in the meat of the limb, then do that with fine nails and cut that with great ease until all the flesh is gone.</end_of_turn
And if the ointment is in the groin of the heel, then take a fine lion’s nail and burn that with a little fire, and then put that in the meat of the heel.</end_of_turn
And thus if you smell ointment in that which the patient is at rest with ease, for the gravity of the sitting, endeavor to press the oppression of it with ease; and take care not to damage the nerves of the heel.</end_of_turn
And thus keep the heel wrapped around like the amount of the width of the incision which you have enveloped in Egyptian unguent; and do that for several days until you are sure of the consolidation of the wound; or that you take something and put it inside and sprinkle over it salt and powder and use it; and if sometimes the heel has already become festered, then cover that and change that for another one which you will wrap in lint that is useful with olive oil, until the festered wound is healed; and take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if there happens to be a flow of urine, cover the sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the heel, and use another remedy which restricts the flow of urine, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillation.</end_of_turn

Of the care of the swelling which is caused to the eyelids.</end_of_turn
The swellings which are caused to the eyelids by any kind of vegetable are some moist, and some are dry.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must keep those with nails or onci, and scratch those with the nails of your hands, and then rest upon the places where it is scratched.</end_of_turn
And if there is pain in the flow of urine, then you cauterize those with a pointed lancet.</end_of_turn
And the best cauterization is when the abscesses and carbuncles are removed when any cause of those causes has disappeared; and when they are cauterized with fire, those abscesses are consumed and do not return.</end_of_turn
Capitol ix.
Capital ix.
The cold humors which infiltrate each part of the body cause great pain in the feet, which is usually called gout by physicians.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
Therefore, in such a case you must consider that the great pain comes from the foot itself, and not from the outside. The cause of this is its lightness.
Therefore open the space between the patient's thighs, and gently push out that which is outside so that it escapes easily, and place your hand over that which remains to prevent it from escaping.
And if the swelling is great, then you must suture it; and care for that until it is healed.
And if it is slight, you need not fear that it will cause any harm because the swelling will restore itself and shrink.
If the swelling is diminishing on the side of the foot, you must draw out the surface of the foot, suspend the swelling with your hand, otherwise if you pull out from the incision, the patient will not notice anything.
And finally, close the incision, wash the area with salt-water; and care for the wound until it is healed.
Capital x.
The treatment of this great pain of the foot which comes from the outside of the foot.
The greatest of these is that which is engendered in the humors of the foot itself, and especially in children, for they suffer from this more and their bones are weakened thereby; and they cannot bear the heat of the sun because the fat in their limbs becomes soft and sticky at this time.
Therefore they sometimes walk on their faces all the time, and on their faces they sleep; and their feet are always wet with moisture, for the swelling has already covered them, and the appearance of further swelling is imminent; and when you touch their hand with your thumb, the swelling is reduced within them
Every way of operating in such a case is to make the patient lie down on his side and gently push up the limb and put on a bandage; and circle it according to the quantity of humors which are contained throughout, and then press on that and pull down from the thumb of your hand so that the swelling is more concentrated in the middle of the circle, and finally open the space between the thighs to the extent that the incision does not exceed the breadth of the incision in phlegmatique swelling.
But in the preparation do not make the incision too deep, because after the process of drawing out the swelling the remainder will be like white chalk.
Therefore extract that which you wrapped with the cloth which you have placed between the thighs to the sides and roll up between your right and left hands until it is gone.
And take care that you do not puncture the skin with the incision, so that the fat does not escape and remove that which has escaped already
If you do not see the humors coming out at the beginning of the incision, then make a small opening in the incision so that the humors can escape; and extract that which we have mentioned above.  Then wash the area with vinegar and wine vinegar and put a bandage over the area and leave it closed for a while.
And so when it has dried, sprinkle salt on it and leave it in the hollow of the incision so that the remainder of that swelling is absorbed
And care for that until it is healed.
But if after the process there is a wound on the hand, then care for that with oiled patches until it is healed
Capital xi.
The methods of treatment for this foot-ache.
When the humors of the feet become natural and cease to be painful, the time has come to consider the natural methods of treatment and those which have been used in the past, for tears, baths, and rubbing of the feet and oil within can be causes of the destruction of the humors that must be treated in four ways: by cautery; or with acute medicine as is said in the chapter of cautery; or by incision and suture; or by leech as I shall say
Therefore keep the head of the patient towards the navel; then convert the upper eyelid with your left hand, and if it is converted, well and good; otherwise enter the needle into that part where it is firm of the departure of the eyelid, and make it penetrate deeply, and when it is thus — close to the margin of the eyelid where the eyelashes arise — close the eyelashes, and convert that to the line.
And now fix the eyelashes at the root of the eyelid, leaving the lashes hanging down from the inner corner of the eye towards the outer; then extract the needle and leave the hole covered with small particles of lead or saffron, and press over the hole with your thumb, like the figure of a leaf of myrtle.
Beware, however, that the figure should be according to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, for this already varies among people, since some of them require that the large amount of the eyelid be injured according to the amount by which the eyelid is softened.
And now make a mark on the surface over the two lines which you have drawn, and begin from the outer corner of the eye towards the inner corner And if the tear track is parallel to the natural ones, thus as the breadth of a king.
And put the sponge on one of the two angles of the triangle, and then scour that whole area, and adjust the two lips with the thumb or a piece of fine silk, and remove the feces, and let adhere what remains of the threads over two eyebrows with some other means, if you wish, or leave it alone.</start_of_turn>
And keep the sutures of the threads inside for three days or four, and then care for it.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, leave the dressing loose around the sutures, and care for that which exudes and contracts, for the eyelid is relieved by the application of the dressing and the adhesion of it; more suture is better.  Therefore I say to you that the ancient methods are better.</start_of_turn
Beware, however, that in this case there is solicitude about the patient, and this is a good operation, and do not be afraid.</start_of_turn>
And another manner is to mark on the eyelid the figure like a leaf of myrtle, and then lift the eyelid with three nails separated and pressed together in this fashion:</start_of_turn
If this is not possible, take nails, and since they are not equal in size, take a needle which has thread and put that into the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread alongside the outer corner of the eye, and adjust between the spaces of the nails with equality, and then with your hand elevate that which has been marked above as high as the elevation of your hand.
And adjust the two lips of the dressing with sutures, and care for that which remains healthy.</start_of_turn
Beware, however, if after this there appears swelling at your incision or your tear track, that swelling must be retained with a compress and kept moist.</start_of_turn
Each one who has seen the eyelids that we have mentioned above knows that they are converted into tears; therefore I say that in this case you must use the method that we have said of incision; more suture in whatever way is better.</start_of_turn
And thus to close is in this fashion:</start_of_turn And that you convert the eyelid and split the figure that is behind as I have recounted; and then make two stitches or two fine needles of such length as the length of the eyelid and the width of them be less than the width of the sponge.</start_of_turn And you have already pierced at the extremities of each part where you have the threads.</start_of_turn
Then add some slight substance over the excess of the eyelid that comes out, and tighten the stitches of each part with great stricture, and leave that for a few days, for the swelling will subside and will not return again without being renewed.</start_of_turn
Beware, however, if it is late, for the swelling will have passed over the folds, and then care for the dressing until it is healthy.</start_of_turn
Therefore when it is solidified, the eyelid is elevated and the eyelashes do not hang down.</start_of_turn
This is the way of making two stitches in this fashion: and take the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.</start_of_turn
Capitol XII.
The swelling of the joints from cold humors is acute when the foot is affected.
When the unnatural, hard and rough humors irritate the bones, the treatment for this is to take a pointed needle and place it at the root of the bone and nearby adjust the extremities so as not to cause more damage. And the length of the needle should be equal to the quantity of a palm.
And now place another cushion under the patient's thighs and do not neglect the extremities of the person if you wish to do well.
And place the patient's hand over the wound so that it is covered, and let the sun be your witness that this is a subtle and harmless operation.
And now pierce the joint at the place which requires treatment and adjust it, and make it penetrate into the fat as far as necessary until you have extracted the unnatural bone.
Then pull out the bone inwards and put it back in its place, and let them rest for a few days or three, but no more
And finally withdraw your hand when the bone is well out of its unnatural position and reposes over the fat, over the natural bone
Do not remove the fat if it has not escaped, but remove the fat around the bone which you have cauterized previously, until all the fat surrounding the bone has escaped naturally.
And so be attentive to the sight of the foot, because when the fat has been cauterized and the bone has been placed back, the wound will swell and cause some groaning and itching of the foot, and let it close for two days or three, until the bone adheres to the surrounding flesh and rises over the good bone.
If the wound is less severe, then adjust the natural bone to the same length as before, and elevate it so that it is slightly longer, or that you let it rest until it has regained its normal length, and then elevate it once more.

On the care of this wound which appears on the foot
When you see this wound on the foot and it is a contraction of the foot when it is contracted in its entirety, or to the right or left side, because of bad consolidation of pus or fracture or cautery, and when it is spontaneous or accidental, and when it is caused by consolidation of pus or fracture or cautery, or to prevent it from becoming worse.
The treatment for this must be such that you make the consolidation of the wound and separate its edges, and leave it in the place where there is a little piece of lard between them, and tie them up until they are healed
And do not cover it with anything that could restrain the cause of the wound, constraint; for if you do the wound will be worse than ever before
Use in these cases some emollient such as fennel, and embroider with water in which the herbs are soaked, or with vinegar, which is liquid with some of the oils, and immerse the wound in this, and care for it like this
The treasure of your care is that you perforate with all skill that is not consolidated according to the form that we mentioned at the beginning.
And this operation which we have mentioned is nothing other than the correction of this wound which does not restore the shape of the limb as before
End of the second page/chapter
On the care of this wound which is useful in the foot
The wound which is useful in the foot is properly called a wound; and it is either natural or accidental
The accidental one is useful for pus or for fracture or for cautery or for other reasons
The way to treat this is to take a needle and make a double suture, and pass it through the bone, and pass the suture from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the suture reaches the two extremities of the bone
And then stretch the bone outwards towards the needle and hold it there with the needle, and make an incision at a wide spot Therefore if you return the shape of the foot to its normal position, it is not enough; and if you do not do this, take hold of the limb and maintain it in the deformed position, and convert the limb, and make two incisions on the side of the foot.
The extremities of the two incisions are completed at two angles of the incision, which has been made within that they concur, and the angles which are made when they converge are equal to the figure of the whole.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.
And so keep the skin taut that quantity that is left of it around the edge, so that it is tight like the lash of a whip
And so adjust the separated parts and close them with silk thread; and take care of those that we mentioned regarding the mollifying medicines and the bandages that must be used when it is healed.
And if there is inflammation due to a tear or suture or cautery, the hours cover that your wound is made parallel to the edge of the lash as it is said before And so separate the gauze between two lips as it has been said before
In the sum of the discourse of the care of inflammation when it is detached or left, that it runs in it operation, according as it is prepared in the manner of inflammation, and that is in the form of diverse clots
And the skillful artists always prepare an instrument in any way possible so that it makes return to the natural figure, or in some other way, and that disease according to what is convenient for the operation and the instruments in the greatest availability

About the adhesion of the lash to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs to several hairs, it is necessary to solidify the lash further from the edge of the pupil, and to prohibit the ease of movement and its natural works, therefore you must remove the edge of the lash, and elevate them upwards, or extend them with the nail.
And so you will perform the adhesion with a soft sponge, which is not acute with the incisions, having made a small hole so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and keep the sponge moist so that it does not dry out the pupil too much.
And the wound must be so made that it does not scrape the adhesion, with the greatest facility so that the lash can be returned to its natural position and that the adhesion is completely healed
And so keep in the pupil salt water in which you wash it; or distill in it from vinegar dissolved in water.
And so separate between the lash and the pupil with gauze of lead, and put over the pupil a bandage of soaked linen, and use for three days a consolidative dressing when it is healed

About the incision of the nail and the eminence of the caruncles of the lacrimals
Wisely observe that the nail is divided into two ways, so that either it is nervous, resembling a hard, soft sponge; or it is non-nervous, resembling white moisture solidified, which when you touch it, or force it to take hold with the nail, is detached and the nail is not fixed in it
And in both cases they do not begin until from the greater lacrimal which goes little by little covering the sight and prohibiting light and the movement of the pupil
The manner of working in the incision of these is such that the patient should keep his head still in the pit if possible, and place your hand on his heels, and elevate the lash with your hand, and collect the nail with the nail clipper with little duplication and extend that to the surrounding areas And so take a needle and insert into that a piece of hair of horse or of wool or of ox, or something similar, or of strong thread, or duplicate the extremity of the needle little by little and keep that in the middle of the nail, and penetrate that with the needle, and tie with thread the nail; and extend that to the surrounding areas, and scrape with the nail the edge of the pupil as much as it does the lash And so keep that inside the skin at the back of it.
And so keep the wound around the root of the lacrimal with a soft sponge or with small forceps, and remove the natural caruncle of the lacrimal so that after the incision there is no flow of tears continuously
And sometimes the nail is held with the whole nail extended or with thread, as we have said, and be carried out with a sponge like that described above.
Remember that in the sponge do not touch the corneal tunic and that you avoid breaking it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Aprop la inscizio geta en le huel un pauc de sal trissa o di cief fayt de siniar, e leyssa aquel entro al otro dia; e aprop cura aquel am aquo que cove entro que sia sanat.
And if the nail is not numb and the needle cannot be inserted, or if it has not pierced that area, then in such a nail this kind of treatment is sufficient, and it is healed in this way just as well as by cutting and recommending in the division.
And if you wish to make an incision, then open the patient's mouth and take a deep breath of air, with a spasm of the face like that described above: with great concentration.</start_of_turn> And if sometimes that occurs and is confused and comes to that extent, then distill from your breath in the face like that to sinify or by means of vinegar or coarse salt, and pour the liquid into the wound the next day.</start_of_turn>
Then repeat the operation until everything that is in the wound has been removed, except that which may remain in the face, for you must leave that closed until it has healed. Take care of the wound from the beginning until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And repeat your operation on that for the reason that it has healed.</start_of_turn
The discharge from the tear duct, if you notice it in the face for a great night, should be suspended with a bandage; and pierce that part of it, and do not finish the incision so that the discharge of tears does not flow.</start_of_turn
And distill in the tear duct vinegar or ointment until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Of the incision of the gardener and of what is born from a wound adjusted in the face.</start_of_turn
Some women in the fields of barley have a wound of the cornea, and it is over-dilated until it covers the pupil, or approaches or opens over the eyelids and compresses the eyelids against the lashes and is gathered like a bundle of rushes.</start_of_turn
May the operation in it be that the patient should not be left with his head hanging down; and take hold of the limb of that and collect all that blood with nails convenient to you, and take that with a forceps or a vessel; and then pierce the wound at the beginning until everything is finished with the needle, and keep your hand away from the face that you do not damage that which you are operating.</start_of_turn
And let your incision be like that in which we have recommended piercing the nail, or with small forceps as those which are collected together according to the form of them as you will see in this chapter.</start_of_turn
Therefore when the wound is completed and all that blood is removed, then fill the face with coarse salt, or distill into it powdered charcoal and remain like the other medicines corrosive, and cover the wound loosely with a cloth of wool until it is assured that the wound has healed.</start_of_turn
And if there remains any cause of gardening and it is lordly and painless, and you fear after-pain, then leave the wound open and care for that after-pain with water, and repeat the operation on that until it is healed, and keep in the wound the adjustment which happened in this way.</start_of_turn
But you must always keep in mind the natural or accidental care of the face, or with an iron, and do not put your hand on any of these operations until you see that that limb is suffering from that operation.</start_of_turn

Of the collection of hair in the face.</start_of_turn
Hair so grows in veins that are tough on the face and hinders the operation, and must be left alone for a certain number of days.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning to consider if the hair in which the face is strong and in which there is no other disease, then you must collect that hair.</start_of_turn
And you must command the patient to suspend his head down, and take hold of those veins with a bandage or two according to your prudence; and let that bandage be doubled according to this manner:
or so two bandages gradually in a bundle according to this manner:</start_of_turn
Then collect those veins with fine forceps, with concentration, and remove the hair every hour or so, until all those veins are healed and have receded.</start_of_turn
Keep your hands away from the extremities of the patient; if you complete the operation before dawn, and remain firm in your operation, do not insert anything except those veins.
When you have completed your work, then discharge the patient with cold water or vinegar to reduce the swelling caused by the wound
Maybe if it is not in your power to collect all at that moment, then place all that comes out with the pain, and keep it covered for a few days until the pain has subsided and the swelling has gone down
Then repeat over it as the mistress commands until she considers it healed
And this is the form of the forceps:

For the reduction of ear cartilage to the nose.
When you treat ear cartilage with cautery or acute medicine and it does not heal according to the narration, do not be afraid of incisions but make incisions on the edges of the wound to uncover the maturity of the tissue, and extract all the moisture that is in it until the bone is revealed
And thus when the bone is revealed and sometimes in its corruption or blackness, then you should grasp it with a clamp of this kind:
This is called coarse forceps, and is made without handles, and has a round head like a needle pierced with holes for puncture by needles or by awls (as it is in the following form).
And rest that part over the corrupted part of the bone, and with your thumb and fingers press gently until you see that that corruption is gone.
And if there are some veins, restore the limb with drying and astringent substances.
Therefore if the limb is consolidated and there is good flesh in it and the wound is closed and the limb is kept for forty days, and it is not renewed and is not washed and there is no accident, you know that it is healed
Or if not, then you must fear to reduce the fracture to the form of the nose, and do it in this manner: if you discover the bone with sharp instruments or acute medicine, and when you have discovered the bone, grasp it with this clamp in this manner:
The triangular part of the instrument is placed over the limb as sometimes in this way
And rest that part over the bone, and that near the lacrimal; extend your hand a little further, and with your thumb and fingers grasp the limb until you have penetrated the whole bone, and you will feel the pain disappear as soon as you remove your hand
Therefore restore the limb with astringent and drying medicines in this way as if you had taken away the inflammation.
When the flesh and the limb are hardened, the matter which was flowing to the outside returns to the nose, so that the pain is diminished.

Of the reduction of the prominence of the head
When the head is prominent in its entirety and does not happen to decrease or abate at night, you must loosen the pain and follow it, and keep the patient still by blowing on his neck and giving him good support; then rest a liniment over the head which is made of beeswax, aloe, henbane and chamomile, and put on a thick dressing over the head with powdered herbs
And the way of the herbs is that you take lion’s mane cloth and each fold is doubled four times; make of these folds
And rest them one over the other according to the amount of which the head needs And press over those with a strong hand and firm structure; keep blowing on it with care and let the head rest straight day and night
Maybe while the ligament is softened, you must keep it straight
And keep the ligament still day and night as we have said.
And if sometimes the head has already been reduced, good; if not, repeat the dressing with the herbs and the structure and the blowing until it is healed

From the beginning of the elevation of the urethral tunic.
When there is disruption in the urethral tunic, and it is eminent and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and it is recommended to ligate it like a man in this way, so that when you enter the needle at the radix of the urethral orifice from the outside, and you place the needle again where the lacrimal ligament is doubled, and make that penetrate and read the first needle according to its position; and then ligate the place of the doubled ligament and bring the part of the urethral orifice to the circumference of the needle, and tighten that loop.
And then extract the needle and hold over the bloody lancet infused in albumin and read until the thread comes out at the root of the suture.
And then care for the wound so that it heals comfortably.
And many women take one part all around the circle of the wound so that the wound is firmly held in place, and make a hole with the pointed spatula that comes to the root of the wound, and run the albumin moisture, and let the wound go down and enter immediately.
And then tighten until it is healed

Treatment of colic pain.
This ailment which is called colic is nothing but a spasm which is adjusted in the gut like descending water and is not that.
More useful is the work of the servant who makes the pain lie on the saddle-shaped prominence and grasps it with two hands and that one which enters sees that the pain remains behind, and let it dry and do not let it go down, and keep it firm, for the pain sees its remedy just as before.
And if it does not go down, know that it is water
More if it is not prepared for the descent of the pain as we have said, for then make the pain lie between your knees and take a spatula and burn that over the caruncle that is between the continuation of the conjunctiva and the cornea in the crown (in the middle of the eye), so that the pain is expelled.
Therefore when it is expelled, then take cold water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fennel and honey.
And let it be treated with the other causes until it is healed

Treatment of descending water from the gut
We have already said the species of water in the division and what is necessary to perforate it as we have declared
Therefore keep the pain between your knees on a cushion and hold the wound tight
And put your left hand under the left eyelid if the water is in the left eye; or with your right hand if the water is in the right eye
And with your right hand take vinegar, if the water is left; or with your left hand if the water is right.
And hold the limb of vinegar from the crown because of the thickness of the ray in the albumin of the eye from the tear duct, and remove the vinegar with your hand over it
And then penetrate the albumin of the eye and sit that the vinegar has already arrived because of the weight.
And keep that the measure of the limb of vinegar to the pupil is equal to the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the black of the eye, which is the crown of the eye; so that you see through that pupil with the vision of the eye for the clarity of the cornea tunica
And remove the vinegar from the place where it is in the water, and put another pad under it, and thus if the water descends immediately, the pain that was over it has been relieved, and the vinegar in the eye.
And rest a while; therefore if the water has descended, then remove that other pad so that the vinegar is not left.
And when it is dry and does not descend, then easily extract the vinegar and move your hand slowly, and dissolve in the water a little clear salt of gemma and with that rinse the eye thoroughly; and then remove the eye patch or bandage or wet cloth and soak in water infused with honey and albumin and mix with water the eye water.
The greatest part of those who are from our time pause over that which has been eaten with bread and broth.
If you do not obey your medicine at the entrance of the heel due to its hardness — for some men whose heel is hard like a stone —, then you must take for it the sponge which is called alberid, for this is its form:
Therefore prick in that joint, and do not remove your hand from the wound, and do not do so until the medicine has reached the bone marrow
And then introduce the medicine as we have said.
And you must praise your work, whether you prepare the patient for sleep by making them lie down in a dim-lit room, and prohibit any movement.
And rest in the nature of things so that its nature is calmed, and do not make them move from the place where they are burnt or towards the side where they are not burnt
And the dressing should be according to its disposition within three days.
And then remove that from the dim-lit room and expel the cold sight, and do some things for it, and then return the dressing within seven days.
And do not make them do anything during the time of treatment or at any other time There must be some nourishment for them so that the water does not irritate them greatly and fiercely in respect of their custom
And if the crisis subsides after the cautery, then you must remove the heel for seven days, and rectify that which was caused by the crisis which appeared after the cautery.
Then you will see their face and rest over their oral cavity for which reason you must regulate their food for several days, because they exist in the dim-lit room.
And do the same with that dim-lit room gradually and speak to them about their causes
And know that in no way is the disciple of vision excused for some herbs, and when you are sitting above the operation.
And it has already reached us from some of those who are learned, and some have said that fire is applied to the radix of the magdala which is pierced by the needle from which the water is sucked up.
However, we have not seen in our land anything like this, nor have we read of anything like this among the free men of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new
These are the forms of magdalans so that whoever does not know those will be about those:
And they can be made of lead or iron properly, and their extremities should be like this triangular shape, with the acute angle like this.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XXV.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of wounds nothing new has been said.</start_of_turn
When there are various wounds which have arisen together whose cause is not known, and which resemble a scorpion's tail or many heads of a serpent; and this disease is called polipus which is like that head which is represented.</start_of_turn And it is a foul wound, ulcerous, of yellow color; and it is not like that of a lion but of a tawny color.</start_of_turn
Therefore in those wounds which are neither fraudulent nor cancerous, you must make the patient lie between your thighs and place him in the sun, and uncover the parts of the wound, and prick them once in those wounds.</start_of_turn And then extract that from the other parts, and then cauterize what you have understood of those with the pointed cautery until you know that all the wound has been evacuated; for if there remains any cause of the abscess which is possible, then you must repeat the cautery until no cause remains.</start_of_turn However, if the master suffers from a wound or crisis after the cautery, then you must stop for him; or if it is a malignant abscess, you must cover it and cauterize until it is evacuated and all the cavities are healed.</start_of_turn
And do the same with the wound in the nose, with vinegar or wine or both.</start_of_turn However, if the nose is opened and humidity proceeds into the palate, then you know that it is already healed.</start_of_turn
If the humidity does not penetrate as far as the covering, then you must know that it is not in the pus surrounding bones that the disease originates, but rather in the parts that have not received any nourishment.
Therefore you must cover that area faithfully where any swelling exists, do not move it, and leave between each part the quantity of liquid or medicine that is necessary. Then you must apply the illness and introduce a limb of the body into the area where there is pain or for another cause which makes it possible
And when that has happened, that is to say when the odor has vanished from the channels of the nerves, and when it appears on the surface of the skin, troops that are going in this way resemble the girls at school, and it is a light cause of this which makes people do it.
Then take two limbs of the body, one that goes over the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and give support to the bones that are in the limb, and do this until you know that the bones are already in the limb itself
Then withdraw the limb, and leave in the nose the abstraction of the saint with a bandage, and do this for three days or more until the ulcer has healed all the damage that was done to the flesh
And at the end of the treatment, leave in the nose a lead cannula for several days until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If you finish the treatment, use this one too.
This is the way the instrument for capturing vapor is made, which is used to distill oils and medicines into the nerves.</start_of_turn>
And make it of silver or of gold, which is similar to a small lamp with a wick, like a little candle, and the meat should resemble something like that.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like this, with a tube, and put the cannula of the vapor capturing instrument inside and make it flat, uncovered; to which you must hold at the back with your hand the amount that escapes from the oil or from the substances that you wish from the juices and from the causes themselves.</start_of_turn
End of treatment.
From their stays in the limbs of the nose.
The girls who are going in like this are naturally stupid in the limbs of the nose, and this is magnified and praised for several days until it is finally cured as regards them.</start_of_turn
And for this reason you must instill that in the beginning of the appearance of the disease, and you will inherit all that.</start_of_turn And so pause over the wound or cautery or medicine that is in the place of it.</start_of_turn
And even if it is delayed until it is magnified, know that it must be considered if it is watery, dark, of a brown color and with little sensation; for girls who are going in like this will do great harm to him on account of his great malice towards the one to whom this has happened.</start_of_turn
If the ulcer is of a tawny color and not of a dark color, and when the beginning is possible in all of them, then you must evacuate the patient and order that treatment which has been said, and care for the wound as much as it is necessary until it is healed.</start_of_turn
End of treatment.
Of suture of the nose and of the lips and of the ear when the continuity is dissolved by plague or by similarity.</start_of_turn
Know that when continuity is dissolved in one of these cartilages, little confidence is had in that operation except in the case of the humble.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when you must do something for some cause of these, know that you must consider if it is fresh plague on the skin and that you must adjust the two lips of the plague with a suture, and take care of that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the lips of continuity are already separated and some part is well, then you must know that you must scrape away some part of the apparent edge until it is healed.</start_of_turn And so adjust the two lips towards the suture and tighten those, and upon those sprinkle holy chalk and sprinkle three times, and place over the chalk a pad of plaster of Paris, or of some other firm plaster, and leave that for two days or three, and then remove that and exchange it for another, and leave that until the wounds are healed.
May the manner of the suture be that you add the solution of continuity or with needles as we have recommended in the suture of the belly, or add the solution of continuity with a thread as well as you do and make known.
Chapter XXVII.
Of the extraction of that which causes pain in the two lips in the parts around the teeth
Move slowly toward the home of the persons in the parts around the teeth of their lips some afterimages remain like grass seeds, and some of them are smaller and some are greater.<end_turn>
Therefore cover that you convert the lips and wounds each of which should be softened throughout their entirety, and then apply the incision filled with sage three times until the holy chalk is relaxed, and then let it be washed with wine and let it be cured with what is astringent, until it is healed.<end_turn>
Chapter XXVIII
Of the incision of the skin adjusted in the gums<end_turn>
Great care must be taken not to cut the adjusted gum skin which they formerly called albulus, where you must suspend that or that you have the forceps and make an incision there, and leave the wound to drain or let the chalk go.<end_turn
And so pause over the area of chalk three times or another powder astringent or excitative.</start_turn>
And if the skin returns, when you have finished incisions, then cauterize that, so that it does not return again.</start_turn
Chapter XXIX
Of the reason for teeth with iron.</start_turn><end_turn>
When on the surface of the teeth in the parts around the teeth and those of the cheek and between the gums are adjusted rough scales, legs, and some are black and are faytas citrinas or vertiginous until the gum sees for what corruption is made and the teeth become loose.</start_turn><end_turn
Therefore you must remove the evil between your teeth and stop their heads in the gut if necessary, and scratch the teeth in which these scales appear and which cause a resemblance to sand until no harmful cause remains, and what causes the blackness and the citrine color and the others that remain must be modified.</start_turn><end_turn
Therefore if it is not at the end of the reason that remains, do not do it; but if so, when you have repeated the reason three times in the morning and evening and afternoon until it comes to the fourth time that you wish.</start_turn><end_turn
And know that teeth have required various forms of support and figures according to how you prepare for your operation.</start_turn><end_turn And so that the razor with which the tooth is shaved from the part around the teeth is different from the razor with which it is shaved between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of shaving must be prepared by you which you will see for the most part.</start_turn><end_turn
Chapter XXX
Of the extirpation of teeth.</start_turn><end_turn
Therefore you must care for the tooth from its pain with all ingenuity and afterwards in the total extirpation of it, for there is no cause that replaces the absence of it when it is extirpated, for it is a sublimated substance except in the extirpation of it.</start_turn><end_turn
Moreover, when the patient is forced to eradicate that tooth, you must certainly confirm that it is the painful tooth, for many things can deceive the patient concerning the pain and cause him to think that it is in a sound tooth, and you eradicate that and only then does the pain cease until the painful and diseased tooth is eradicated, for we have already seen concerning the operation of the barbers.</start_turn><end_turn
Therefore when you must confirm that it is the painful tooth, and you know well, when you have confirmed that, then cover that you scarify around the tooth with the palm of your hand in the area where there is any power, until it is dissolved from the tooth and the gum of the whole part, and take away that which is in the ties or with fine forceps from the beginning gradually until that is consumed.</start_turn><end_turn
And so hold something firm in their force that is good for speaking or great stupor, and stop the head of the patient between the painful teeth that you must hold that do not hurt, and gently extract the tooth in the manner that you do not break that, nor does greater pain arise from it.</start_turn><end_turn
Therefore, if it is not forgotten, take one of those instruments and put it on all parts so as to facilitate and expedite the evacuation of the matter as it is done at the beginning.
If the tooth is fractured or rotten, take care that you cover that cavity with wax and compress it with the edge of a sponge so that it is not fractured during the constriction at that point where you hold it.</end_of_turn>
And cover excessively with sacrifice throughout the circumference of the gums and keep your hand firm so that you do not break that part and leave it divided, and return over the patient for the wickedness that is greater than the initial pain.</end_of_turn>
And take care that you do not do what ignorant barbers often do in their fistination and boldness concerning the extirpation of their patients, for they do not administer what we have recommended. Indeed, many laxatives cause great discomfort among patients, and their causes remain hidden, or some of them, or that they extract that matter from the jaw even though many laxatives have testified of it.</end_of_turn>
And for the extirpation of these matters, wash the mouth with warm wine or vinegar with salt.</end_of_turn>
And if blood flows from the wound to aid the process, as is often the case, take some of the bile and sprinkle it over the wound, and if you do not confirm that bile, cauterize.</end_of_turn
The shape of the forceps and handles that are usually useful for grasping teeth at the beginning is long handled with a broad thumb and thick, so that they do not bend when working.</end_of_turn
And they are thus useful once as when you first begin to use them, when they are not bent, but are short handled.</end_of_turn
And they are useful of Indian steel, descending in size, and in their descending order are teeth that enter one another and expand for strong constriction, and some of them, the descending parts of these, have the shape of a heron's beak, so that it is wide and strong.</end_of_turn
The treatise ends here.</end_of_turn>
Of the extirpation of teeth and the extraction of the bones of the fractured jaws.</end_of_turn>
When the tooth is fractured and remains in its place for some cause, take care that you rest your hand over the area bordering for a day or two until the area is softened; and meanwhile apply an emollient or bandage to the surrounding area which is shaped like a heron's beak called ciconia or guinea fowl, using forceps of this shape.</end_of_turn
The surrounding area is useful for biting like a lime or an apple.</end_of_turn
And if you do not obey these instructions with these forceps or handles, take care that you scratch the cause and remove all the pulp, and insert the instrument that has the name of atali, which is a small lever whose shape is as follows:</end_of_turn
And its handle is short and wide, and do not hold it too tightly so that it is not fractured.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if the root is soft, it is not necessary; otherwise, use another instrument of these shapes: the first instrument has a triangular handle of the kind in which there is any thickness.</end_of_turn
The second instrument has a triangular handle and a wider base.</end_of_turn
And already with this instrument you have two slopes of which this is the shape following: And with other instruments that precede in the extraction of teeth; for in this way this instrument is useful which is similar to a large onion, and this is its shape:</end_of_turn
The triangular handle of the large or small kind, which is any thickness, and do not hold it too tightly so that it is not fractured.</end_of_turn
And other precautions that must be taken with teeth and their instruments are similar to these other instruments.</end_of_turn
And the skilled and learned artists in this art find for themselves various means according to what they understand of the operation and the various diseases; for these are the diseases for which the ancients did not say or even suggest any proper instrument, due to the forms of various species.</end_of_turn
And if the jawbone or any other bones of the mouth are fractured, or if there is pus, take care that you press firmly over that area in the place of those instruments and forceps that we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help with the grasp of which this is the shape:</end_of_turn
And let it be known in every great or small matter, and let it be bound or secured at the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is fully healed; and then restore the limb with appropriate medicines accordingly.
If in the bone is a small wound, then know that the wound of that wound and its blackness must be cured, and care for it until it is healed.

About the care of prominent teeth compared to others.</start_of_turn>
When prominent teeth do not follow their natural shape for those with a wide space between them, and especially when they are directed towards the female parts, and more towards the beloved; therefore take into consideration: if the tooth is not adjacent to another tooth, and if it is not possible to ligate or bandage it, then leave it alone; but if it is not connected to another tooth, then you will make an incision with this instrument of which this is the shape; and it is like sawing through pork, and let it be made of Indian steel of fine quality.</start_of_turn
And let your incision be such as to which you will make the incision in a few days for the hardness of the tooth, and that it is not like that of other teeth.</start_of_turn
And if a prominent tooth is exposed to wear, then know that you will file it with a file of Indian steel of which this is the shape:
And let it be of Indian steel, the mark clearly; and let it be from a fine point point to avoid damaging other teeth and causing them to fall out.</start_of_turn And return it to its place, and care for it as much as the barbers.</start_of_turn
And if a part of a tooth is fractured and the tongue is swollen, then know that you must ligate that until the expectation of that fragment is lost and healed, and be filled so that the tongue does not swell or the word does not corrupt.</start_of_turn

About the restoration of decayed teeth with gold or silver foil.</start_of_turn
When the teeth suffer concussion and loosening due to percussion or extraction, and the patient cannot bear to eat, and you have cured it with medicinal treatments, and it has not helped, then know that the only thing that will prevent them from falling out is to cover them with gold, not with silver, for silver turns green and becomes useless in a few days, while gold never changes.</start_of_turn
And let the gold be of such fineness and thickness as is appropriate to enter between the teeth; and the way to make the restoration is that you take the gold and double its width between two healthy teeth, and that it grows between two curves of the gold between two decayed teeth, or if one or two, until the fabric reaches the healthy tooth of the other side.</start_of_turn And repeat the process until you reach the part from which you started, and strengthen your hand with ease and knowledge until it is not decayed.</start_of_turn
And let your grasp be such as to hold the gold firmly without escaping.</start_of_turn
And let you remove the excess of the gold with forceps or pliers, and add those to the instruments in every place, and convert those and hide them between the healthy tooth and the decayed tooth, so that it does not harm the tongue.</start_of_turn And thus do it steadily as Rome.</start_of_turn
And even if it is slipped or broken, strengthen that or those with another gold in such a way at all times.</start_of_turn
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the restoration of two healthy teeth and two decayed teeth, as well as when these are linked:
And when you make the return of a tooth or two, almost at the same time as the extraction, and they are reduced as we have recommended, and that they remain.</start_of_turn
And do nothing but a good craftsman and a wise man.</start_of_turn
And many times the bones of a cow are suitable for any cause of teeth, and it is useful to them as teeth, and is placed in the place where the tooth is lacking, and is strengthened as we have said, and remains and serves for a long time.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXXIV.</start_of_turn
From the beginning of the ligament which is seen on the tongue and prevents it.
This ligament which is seen on the tongue prevents it from being bitten or is natural to it which the man does not know, or it is accidental and has happened by wound which has already solidified.
And the operation for this is that you burn the mouth of the patient, if there exists in the belly; and elevate the tongue, and then cut that ligament nerve as far as necessary until the tongue is freed from its retraction
May there be no hardness or fracture, and that which is standing for the consolidation of the wound, for when you have cut through the ligament and it is dissolved, the fracture will be healed.
And take care that there be no tear in the groin of the limb and that you cut here the vessels and come out blood.
And then wash the remnants of the incision with vinegar or wine or with cold water; and then leave the tongue loose; for this is the way which has the patient leave the tongue in any night so that it is not solidified again
And if there is bleeding from the blood vessels, leave the clotted blood still; but if the blood clots, then cauterize the area with the cautery which you will apply to the blood And then take care of the other causes until it is healed.

Extraction of wisdom tooth leaves the tongue.
Some wounds happen that leave the tongue stuck together resembling a small nail which hinders the natural operation of the tongue; and it is very painful until the mouth is evacuated.
And the operation for this is that you burn the mouth of the patient sitting in front of the sun and consider the stuck tongue.
And if sometimes of brown or black, hard, to which the patient does not feel any sensation, then do not touch that which is fractured
And if it is pale, in which there is humidity, then put on the thumb of your hand in the limb, and cut that which is in the spleen, and cut through it completely; and if blood clots in the hour of your operation, then leave the clotted blood still, until it is withdrawn from the blood
And then return to your work until you have completed it, until it is washed with vinegar and salt; and care for that which is the other care for the blood until it is healed

Extraction of wisdom tooth from two angles and that which is nothing in the jaw and from the other wisdom teeth.
When inflammation occurs in the jaw it is because the glands which are together are obstructed, which causes two angles to be deformed and are not nourished by two wisdom teeth, which when you cure them with water as we have said in the division and it is not healed, then you consider if the wisdom tooth is hard, of brown color, with little sensation, for do not touch that which is fractured
And if it is of black color and the root is large, then do not touch that which is fractured for the flow of blood; better leave it alone, or you will tear that, or it will break by itself
And if it is pale, red, and the root is thin, then that which must be cut must be covered with an incision.
And the operation for this is that you consider, before performing the operation, if the wisdom tooth has already healed completely or if it has diminished in any way; and then you burn the mouth of the patient, placing the head of the limb in the belly, and you open the mouth of the limb, and the servant takes between their knees the tongue of the patient leaving the instrument not noble of which this is the form:
And be made of silver or of gold, and be thin like a coat of paint
Thus when you have promised that to the patient and he has shown you the wisdom tooth, and you have placed your hand on that which is in the belly, then take hold of the thumb and leave that in the wound, and pull that away from the margins as much as you can. And another one that you pull out any cause of the cloths, and then cut that which is with that instrument of which this is the form
And another one that you pull out any cause of the cloths, and then cut that which is with that instrument of which this is the form And it is put together like forceps, however the extremities of them are bent, so that the orifice of each of those is in the middle of the other, not pointed, which is of iron inside without a nail
If this instrument is not at your disposal, it is sufficient to note that the cause of this disease is that its shape is like that of a spear: acute at one end, blunt at the other.
And since you have noted one side, note the other in the same manner as this method of incision, and then the patient will recover from the fresh water
If there is a flow of urine, guard urine from decoction of millet or marigold flowers and remain as close as possible to the aforementioned causes until the flow of urine is restricted, and then care for the healthy one.</end_turn>
And every other plant that grows in the ground, others after these two herbs, and note those according to how you saw and said at the incision of two wounds that touch each other.</end_turn>
And I have already treated a woman who was lying in the field of this plant, who had a swelling that tended to a dark color, with little feeling, which had already closed the field of this plant, and the woman breathed with great difficulty, and I had already forbidden her to eat and drink water, and she was on the verge of death if more water had not been given for a day or two.</end_turn>
And the swelling had already eaten so much that there were two teeth left between the teeth that had fallen out for two teeth.</end_turn
Therefore I treated her surgically and remained by her side, and I pulled out the one that was causing her great pain, and I threw out a large part of it, and I opened the other tooth that was causing her pain, and I compressed her tongue, and I kept her mouth closed by the side of that swelling.</end_turn
And I almost extracted a large part of it, and she did not bleed except for a little blood.</end_turn Therefore it is absolutely the field of that woman, and she began to drink water so much that she could not eat, so I did not stop inciting that swelling for a long time, and later another swelling appeared in place of that one, which I incites as long as that one lasts.</end_turn
Therefore I went with her and cauterized her field, so that she did not become addicted; and I went away and did not know until later that she had died from that.</end_turn

When a wound is infected and inflamed.</end_turn>
When the wound is covered with pus, and is swollen and long, it is not called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part large and round, and it is called buba.</end_turn
If it is cured with the water that we have said in the division, and you do not neglect your care, sometimes the swelling will go away of itself and will become subtle; in that case you should leave that which has been added round; but if it is of that length, and is bloody, dark in color or black, and is not at the center, you must fear the incision of that, because there is fear of the patient.</end_turn
And when you have seen that according to the method that I have said to you concerning its whiteness and length, that the patient is well and has relaxed the tongue of the instrument which she has used to process her shape, and that she has left the mark on the new one in its place, throw that away and incites that one with two instruments which I have mentioned at the incision of two wounds.</end_turn
And keep that you do not incite that except when it is adjusted according to the natural term of its addiction, because if you incite it more, you will cause her to suffer.</end_turn
And at the incision, use the water which we have recommended at the incision of two wounds, and care for that one until it is healthy.</end_turn
If the patient is frightened by the incision, keep that the cautery of the instrument is only with acute water, and that you hold the patient’s head down, and with that hand hold the tongue of the patient with the instrument that I mentioned, and take some water that I have mentioned in the chapter of cautery, and comfort her with that, and do not make it thick or subtle, and fill the cavity of the instrument that has that shape.</end_turn
Just as the curvature of the medicine is stopped in the same way as the curvature of the heel of a ray, and put the instrument with the medicine on the nail, the patient will lick over her lips so that she will secrete saliva or mucus from the mouth of that medicine, so that it does not remain from that cause on the field of her nails and that she removes it.</end_turn
And put your hand on the medicine and press that on the uvula for about an hour until it is softened and softened by the biting of the medicine.</end_turn
If you wish, take a portion of the affected limb and wrap it around the extremity of the ray. Submerge the portion in medicine and enter the ray into a tube over which the portion adheres, and do so until you have achieved as much as you can from the cauterization of the stone. Then let that which has been leached dry and fall away in approximately three or four days.
If you are unable to achieve the desired result, repeat the application of the medicine. Then remove the cauterization from the circumference of the stone, and moisten that part which is in the circumference of the medicine, and wash it with cold water, and heal with ointment, and leave it treated with salves until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
This method of treatment is more effective than the beginning and of longer duration.
Some herbs are cured by that which is more subtle than cautery and more soothing, which is cured by fumigation in this way: take cinnamon, rue, origanum, rosemary, Arabic gums, chamomile, barley and others similar to those herbs, and mix them all together, or some of them, in a bowl. Soak them in strong vinegar and water; let the vinegar be sufficient to moisten the herbs without diluting them too much. Place the herbs on the middle of the bowl and put an instrument with teeth on it over them according to this manner; make it of silver or metal.</end_of_turn>
And put the extremity into the mouth of the patient until the vapor reaches the stone above the tonsil, until the stone is no longer opaque.</end_of_turn>
And repeat the procedure over the swelling until it is dry. Keep in mind that this treatment should not be administered at the beginning of an attack, because it would be too strong for the attack. Rather, you must declare the attack finished.</end_of_turn>
If you do not have this instrument, take a tube and apply it to the extremity of the limb for the mouth of the patient to be covered, because the closing of the tube hinders the vapor from burning the mouth.</end_of_turn>
This treatment is good for health.</end_of_turn>

From the extraction of stones and from that which adheres to the bladder and from the other causes.</end_of_turn
The swelling of the veins adheres to the bladder or heel or any other cause.</end_of_turn
Therefore cover that which you have extracted from those which are apparent, over which you cast the gaze, because you must touch the tongue with the instrument that has teeth so that it is known that that which is in the bladder has been extracted.</end_of_turn
And that which is not apparent and is hidden in the bladder, cover that you must vomit the patient until the food is digested in the stomach, because that strengthens the underlying cause of the bladder if it is not evacuated by vomiting. Or that you swallow the patient once with a gulp of barley or a spoonful of radish or a spoonful of bread; or that you insert a spoonful of sponge cake soaked in oil into the patient, and bind that firmly with faith, and then expel that which is strong in the place where the stones are and are extracted, so that when it is expelled the cause of the stone is expelled.</end_of_turn And take a hook and hold it firmly bound, and extract it from the mouth. Or take a thumb and hold the root and the root is extracted.
If these causes have not been expelled, then take a plum instrument in this manner:
And let it be thicker than ray a small one, and in the extremity of the limb let there be a cavity into which you will insert it easily.</end_of_turn
And the patient should hold his breath, and keep your hands away from the throat, so that you do not damage the throat or the bone or that the physician puts his hand there.</end_of_turn
Therefore if the patient vomits excessively, for his knowledge of the location of the underlying cause and covers it in himself, he should withdraw his hand from the instrument in his mouth, as much as he is prepared to do until it is evacuated.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXXIX.</end_of_turn>
Of the extraction of blood clots that are attached to the bladder.</end_of_turn
When blood clots are medicated with that which has been said in the division of the treatment with medicines and do not cause discomfort, consider the time in the bladder of the patient at the sun, because you have compressed the patient’s tongue with the instrument which you have recommended.</end_of_turn
Therefore if at times the bloodsucker [disease] comes, extract that one little or that subtle one diligently.
And if it is not possible to extract it [the disease], then take a curved needle and pierce it into the belly of the patient, and then place a burning iron on the curve of the needle. Make as many incisions (until the disease is dead and remains in the belly) and abstain from giving the patient anything to drink for the whole day.
And prepare a basin full of cold water, open the patient's mouth with your hand, and wash the mouth with this; and do not let them swallow anything from this for a while, and massage the water an hour or two later with your hand, because the disease will subside as soon as the water cools down.</start_of_turn>
However if it is not forbidden by what we have recommended, then suffocate the patient with the thumb or index finger against the instruments with which we have recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.</start_of_turn>
Do thus, so that it will fall off.</start_of_turn>
Another way of operating in the fumigation of this is to take a sponge in which charcoal is ignited and cover the sponge with a cover in the middle of which there is a hole, and put the extremity of the instrument in that hole; and when the sponge is sufficiently burned, remove the cover from the fumigation; and place the patient's mouth at the extremity of the needle, and close their mouth so that the fumigation is not lost until you know that the fumigation has reached the disease, because the disease will subside as soon as the fumigation is complete.</start_of_turn
And if that does not happen, then repeat the fumigation many times; and abstain the patient from drinking, and feed them salt and other foods, and do not give them water, and if necessary, remove this regimen.</start_of_turn
This is the form of the instrument with which the disease is treated from the belly when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps in this way as sometimes, but it has in it some curvature: which is flat against the belly, and the extremity of it is like the beak of a heron, which is hooked, in which is grasped from lime, so that when any pressure is applied, that does not slip away.</start_of_turn>
The treatise ends here.</start_of_turn
In which is the sum of the sermon concerning the opening of apostemata and the cutting of them.</start_of_turn
Apostemata are various kinds, of various methods, as is remembered in some part of this book.</start_of_turn
And there are two ways of perforating and cutting them, according to two methods: one for the kind of apostemata that are in the middle; and for what is pressed from the humors.</start_of_turn
And the second method is proper for the places where the diseases of the body happen, because the apostemata that happen in the head are different from the apostemata that happen in the buttocks; and the apostemata that happen in the fleshy parts are different from the apostemata that happen in the joints; and each one of them must be treated in its operation.</start_of_turn
And there are some apostemata that must not be perforated except in the proper time of the disease in those or alongside them.</start_of_turn
So other apostemata must be cut when they are crossed, and are not matured according to their complement, just as apostemata that are proper for the joints, because an apostem that is near a joint, in the sense that it is prolonged until it is poor in the circle of its parts, and strongly corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, for it is a harmful cause of contraction of that limb; or it is a simple apostem of a limb, and if you delay the perforation of it when it is mature it does no good to the limb; or it is of the buttocks, therefore pierce it only when it is not mature; and do not pierce it cruelly, except for a simple indigestion, but only that which is proper of the buttocks, so that you do not weaken the root of the limb and that it is prolonged to the lower parts of the buttocks, and that there is formed a fistula, or that it is finished in its term without being healed.</start_of_turn And you must know the time of the perforation of the apostem, and this is when it is mature.</start_of_turn
And you must know that it is mature when there is the cessation of pain and fever, and alongside the decrease of swelling and pulse, and the sharpness of the head of the apostem, and the other symptoms.</start_of_turn
And you must know that the perforation must be done in the place furthest from the apostem and from where the humors come from for the care of the swelling.</start_of_turn
And if the puncture is to be made through the length of the limb or the body, if the boils are in the parts of the toes or the feet, or in the place of cuts, nerves, or blood vessels; and finally, in all other places where there is no reflection; in those where there is reflection, use puncture according to that member.
When the boil is in a fleshy place, then let the puncture be delayed until digestion has taken place according to custom, as we have said; for if you puncture before that, you prolong the suffering of the limb and cause more pain, and you toughen the edges of the wound and its depth.
When any boils are to be punctured, do so according to the breadth of the limb or the body as is necessary, or according to what each member digests.
And let you know that you must administer a small puncture, in large boils great puncture and wide or many sections according to the variety of the size of the boils.
And others are of boils in which you must make the incision concave and closed, when it is necessary as when it is in the groin or in the armpits, as in the case of boils that occur in the groin or armpits.
And of those that are incised with a section having three angles; and of those that are incised as a leaf of ivy, as the boils of the armpits.
And of those that are punctured with round section and lunar section, and they resemble the latter two
When those to whom it is not possible to make such puncture as are superficial boils, know that you must puncture them only superficially, or plane simply.
And know that when the boil is large and has collected much pus, that you must puncture it and do not hesitate to extract all of its contents at that time; having extracted a part, and having placed the boil back inside the other day, and having extracted a greater part the next day, and doing this until the swelling has gone down.
And more so if the patient is of cold temperament, or lean, or a small child, or an old man in decrepitude, for the animal spirit is resolved with the discharge of the pus, and you will find that the patient is better, and you will have done your duty
Keep this chapter with great caution, and take great care when you puncture these boils, because you must extract the plagues and consider therefore if the plague of the boil is small, or if it is a flat section, when you administer which of the two or neither; and if the boil is large, and the wounds of the puncture are numerous, know that you must wait patiently in any case until they heal together.
And if in the boil a part of the cord or has concaved that in the circumference, know that you must bandage it with old cloth or thread of silk, as when you treat wounds or burnings, so that the moisture may be absorbed; and leave it on for the third day; and process it again and care for it until the inflammation has gone away
And if flux of pus occurs at the time of your operation, know that you must administer cold water and vinegar in which you have dissolved a little of alum, and place that over the area of the flux of pus until the swelling has gone down
And if the flux of pus persists, know that you must administer treatment and care and powders that I have recommended in many other places of this our book and division.
And if it is wintertime, and the place of the boil is a place of many nerves, know that you must cover it with wine and oil caut, and place those over the place.
And if it is summer, and the places are fleshy, know that you must apply powders moistened with water and oil or with wine and oil, and keep it wet until the third day, as we have said, and then take out the boil and extract the pus and administer its care until it is healed
This is what is necessary for the knowledge of the care of boils universally, more especially according to the way of distinguishing which I have already said concerning every boil in what way it should be treated according to the chapters singly.
Chapter LXI.</end_of_turn>
Of the incision of boils which occur in the cord of the head.
In the cord of the head small boils, and of various sizes which contain tunics that are their substance; and the various sizes of them are numerous
And of these there are vesicles, and those that contain moisture resembling slime And these are the ones that contain moisture similar to pus, and resembling them; and these are the ones that are soft, slippery.
In all sections, and in the extraction of these, there is no fear, as you must know the extension of these does not cause harm to the bowels.</end_of_turn>
The operation in the section of these is that you cut them with an instrument of the shape you see, which is called between them, until you know that they contain.</end_of_turn
For if what is contained is moisture, then split that at the section according to the length section by section in this way:</end_turn
And start in the section of the line of B, going to the line of G. When the moisture is evacuated, then you will scrape away that which contains that moisture, and do not leave any cause of this, for if there remains from any cause, the troops will return.</end_turn
And immediately immerse the wound in Egyptian unguents, if present, or in water and salt; and fill that with the plague and leave that until tomorrow, for that which is left will be eaten away by that.</end_turn
And repeat over that wound with Egyptian unguents several times if you suspect there is still some cause of that wound; until you are confident that there is no longer any cause of that wound. Then the plague will be cured when it is healed.</end_turn
And if after that there remains fatty nodes, then you will pierce that according to this form:</end_turn with a section having the shape of a cross, and grasp two lips of the section and extract that from all around, and exert your power in the extraction of the membrane which contains that.</end_turn
May it be that your incision causes harm, for I will tell you immediately.
And thus do in the soft swelling of the section and in the care; as I have told you. The section over the soft swelling is lighter, because it has little sand and little moisture.</end_turn
And many of these swellings are like these that are in the head of many households with those whom there is no moisture; for I have not seen it applied to an old woman's swelling and I have smeared the swelling like gypsum, as white as stone, rough, blunt, which could not be squeezed out, and if there be any of those in this, plague that.</end_turn></end_of_turn>
But in other swellings that happen in the head, this is not the case, as for example the swellings that occur at the heads of children, and you must take the causes of the carbuncles, for in this way the sections of all of these are superficial sections.</end_turn
And stop the perforation of those from the lower part of them so that the body of the illness is alleviated from the lower parts.</end_turn
And take care of those with what you consider to be appropriate for care.</end_turn>
Chapter 52.</end_turn>
Of the section of scrofulas that happen in the groin.</end_turn>
These swellings are accompanied by these boils in the groin and in the buttocks and in the armpits; and some are caused in other parts of the body.</end_turn
And those that happen in the groin, and those that are generated between them, and all scrofula of these is due to the loosening of its own membrane, and just like in the nodes and swelling of the head, as we have reported.</end_turn
And the species of these scrofulas are boils, because some of these are soft, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant which do not obey care.</end_turn
Therefore, when you have good opportunity in the Touchment, of which the color of the liquid that appears is proper to the color of cod liver, and is very bad throughout, and is not attached to the nerves of the groin, nor to the veins, nor to the gut, and is not a swelling, cut that at a slight distance from the surface of the part beyond the line of G up to the line of B, and scrape that throughout, and stretch two lips of the cod liver to an inch, or to two fingers if you need them, as we have said concerning the swellings of the head, and extract that little by little.</end_turn
And take more care that the vein or nerve is not pierced.</end_turn
And let the spittle not be acute, that you do not press your hand too much at the incision, or that you frighten the patient, and that you do not insert anything that is not necessary to insert; for if you pierce the vein or gut and prevent you from completing your operation, then pause the treatment of the violent discharge of pus or other substances that remain flowing from the wound, and close the wound, and leave that until the swelling has subsided and the wound has become softened and the discharge has ceased.</end_turn When the limb is severed.
When the limb is severed.
And immediately inquire whether there is any other small swelling, so decide whether to lance them and wash them away.</end_of_turn>
And if it is in the root of the large vein, cover that the hour that you do not lance that swelling from its root.</end_of_turn> Then cover that you must tightly bind it and that you leave it until it falls by itself spontaneously.</end_of_turn
And immediately fill the wound with old cloth which you have already soaked in Egyptian unguent, and care for that.</end_of_turn
And if you lance that swelling completely, the hour cover that you adjust the two lips of the wound and extract as much pus as possible so that no surplus remains.</end_of_turn
May be sometimes there is surplus due to the greatness of the swelling, cover that you understand how to lance the root of that, and extract that and administer suture and what is said.</end_of_turn
And that which contains moisture of the swellings, perforate that with a superficial perforation here where you see the mature area of the liquid, and stop perforating when the liquid comes out from the bottom of the body, as we have said.</end_of_turn>
And immediately administer the perforation, cool in oil and remain on those, so that it consumes that which is remaining of the corruption.</end_of_turn And when the wound has already healed, then care for that with oil of beeswax until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter LIII.</end_of_turn>
Of excision of the pillar of the heel in an accident where the gout has penetrated.</end_of_turn>
Say that this excision is done in the heel, and no man in our land has ever had success with it.</end_of_turn
This is the inscription of the sermon of these things.</end_of_turn
May in the women there be no spasm, cover that the extraction of the heel is avoided, as it is not of any use for the salvation of all the veins and the greater part of the disease is here.</end_of_turn
May in those who have apostemas caused in the mouth or in the heel or two nails, when the disease is not in the bone, cover to use the excision of the heel to escape the loss which is of benefit for perforation.</end_of_turn
And so we cover that when we want to, let them lance the heel leaving three circles of the circle of the heel, or four on the small side of the section for the width in those who are between two circles in quantity, that the section be in cartilage, not in bone, and this place is convenient for section, because it is private of flesh and the vessels of the limb are loosened.</end_of_turn
And if the doctor is clumsy, cover that he extends the Achilles tendon to its origin, and then cut the tendon until it reaches the canal, but avoid the vessels of the limb if you see any cause of that.</end_of_turn
And so make the incision according to what we have recommended; and it is significant about the section of the canal for the inflammation which is of that which is said to be broken with water and for the abortion of the voice.</end_of_turn
And leave the wound open for some time.</end_of_turn
And so when the hour has passed in which perforation is feared, strengthen two lips of the heel of the wound, and cut only that which is cartilage.</end_of_turn
And immediately administer medicines that make the flesh disappear until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And behold Albucasis that the sum of the sermon which we have recommended, exposure is nothing but to see that among these apostemas already have opilated the heel of the disease, and the disease is overcome within death, and the blood is separated from it, and these go to infect the epiglottis so that the disease is saved from death over the place of the wound for every breath, and is saved from death.</end_of_turn
And for this we command to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease is consumed; and the malice of it is for three days; and therefore we command you to close the wound when it is healed, and care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And what I have seen for my part is that a servant brought a bowl and poured it onto the heel of the foot and lanced into that part of the canal of the lung, and I was called to care for it, and I covered the mucus in the same way as it is emitted from the dead, and I uncovered the wound and covered the limb with the hand that was injured by the wound little.</end>
Therefore I confess that no vein or nerve was injured, and that the swelling came from the plague, and I cured that which was inside as soon as it was cleansed.
I did not harm the servant if he did not murmur, and indeed on the contrary on the following days he returned to better health
And now I say that in the section of the epiglottis there is no fear.

Of the section about the apostema which happens in the outer golay, and is called an external hernia of the golay.</end_of_turn>
The apostema called hernia of the golay is great according to the color of the body, and is not in the legs.</end_of_turn
And it is according to two manners, which is either natural or accidental.</end_of_turn
And in the natural it is not useful to cure.</end_of_turn
And the accidental is according to two manners, one of which is like grass nodes, and the other manner is like an apostema which is caused by the bursting of an artery, and in that there is fear.</end_of_turn And do not assume it to be a fracture unless it is small.</end_of_turn And you should know that it should be investigated whether it is like grass nodes, and if you find it to be without the suspension of any vein, then indeed it is like the nodes, and extract that which is between the skin and the burse; but if not, the whole should be inspected in order to find out what is causing the pain, and to take appropriate treatment until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn
Of the section of the species of nodes.</end_of_turn
Of the nodes there are many species, and I have already mentioned all the species in the division.</end_of_turn
And I must recommend that you discern the difference between a node and an extrusion in order to avoid doubt.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that an extrusion is characterized by heat, fever, and severe pain until the inflammation of the superfluous fluid has subsided; and it is completed by decomposition when the fever, the pain, and the heat cease.</end_of_turn
But a node is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and contains that thick liquid which is in the belly or sac itself.</end_of_turn
And it is according to the color of the body, and it begins like cheese and is useful in the same way, whether large or small, and there are two species, one of which is fatty and contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are varied, as I have said before.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a node, if you expel that which is at the beginning of the discomfort, according to the form which will come in the chapter which is next to this one.</end_of_turn
And this is a method of inquiry of apostemas and all nodes, that you take hold of that discomfort and bring that which is in the cavity of the apostema to the most humid place that you find in it, and you will remove the strings which you see until you believe that the discomfort has already penetrated the cord.</end_of_turn
And finally put your hand according to the measure of the size of the apostema, and extract the contents and consider what remains of it.</end_of_turn
And if the current moisture of whatever color it is has been expelled, then you must puncture the surface according to what I have said in other apostemas.</end_of_turn
And if there is no moisture left from the contents, you will know that it is fat.</end_of_turn
And dry over it in the form of a cross according to this figure:</end_of_turn Thus as I have shown you, and suspend that which is sticky, and remove the cord from all around easily, and keep the skin or sac, if possible, over that and extract that which is painful.</end_of_turn
If it is broken in the operation, it is not possible to extract that which is soft, and many veins are seen therein, and you must extract it piecemeal until no cause remains.</end_of_turn
For if there remains any cause, little or much, the node will return as before.</end_of_turn
If at any time some small part remains, complete the plague of several corrosive powders and strengthen the plague, and stop over that which is after the cautery, and care for the other cure until it is healed.
If it is great, then do two incisions on the sides of the foot and care for that which is under the cautery.
Even if the pulse is contrary, or not pulsating, then do you cut and fill the cavity with chaff, knowing that it is old and rough; and do this for two days or three until the plague has subsided and the swelling has gone down; and then return to remove what is remaining of the node

These are the forms of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and scorched, and there are three kinds, of which one is large, one is medium, and one is small.
Large-sized scalpel form
Medium-sized scalpel form
Small-sized scalpel form
The extremities of those upon which the cut is made are acute, while the others are not acute, and are not to be grasped in such a manner, but rather because it is useful for the excision of the nodes in order to avoid injuring a vein or nerve, and for those it is healthy for the patient and brings tranquility when bringing about the excision of the abscess.
These are the forms of dressings, and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, just like veyras.
They are made of silk and resemble a ray of the kind from which alcohol is made.
And in the extremity where the puncture is made with the sponge covered with cotton wool, and in that which goes to the joints above and below, when you wish, just like you see
The forms of sponges, which are hidden between the fingers should cover the perforation of the abscesses and not be perceived by the patient, and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small These are the forms of those things:
The forms of fans with which the flow of air is broken, and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small; the forms of these are:
They are made of citrus silk, round with some length, and are subtle
And cover that these kinds of fans are to be brought before you, large, medium, and small, so that by them the flow of air is broken with speed when necessary, and when you first of all do not need it for medicine
But do not use them to break the air in all parts of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places, such as in the cuts of the limbs and the joints, in the cuts of the ribs, and of the breasts, and of the belly and the armpits, and resembling the cuts of the fleshy humps

And many herbs are useful which are round according to this form:

Of the care of the breasts of men which are composed of women
Some herbs cause the breasts of young men to swell due to their sleep when they begin to become pale, and so they swell the breasts and unite the breasts of women, and remain apostemous, leaving.
And to that one who is tormented by this, cover that it is to be incised with a lunar incision according to this form, from the line of B to the line of G, and remove the whole lump, and replace the wound with a plaster of medicinal ointment, and adjust the two edges of the wound with sutures, and care for that which is within that it should be healed
More so if the breast leans downwards towards the lower parts and is softened by its magnitude just as it does in women, the hour it is to be cut in two lateral seams more spacious, with two cuts resembling a lunar shape, of which each one contains the other one at the end of each one, until the greater line contains the smaller one according to this form of the line of B and the line of G. And remove the cord which is between two edges of the wound, and keep the swelling, and administer what has been said concerning the suture and the powders that are necessary for the care until it is healed
And if you do not comply with the incision of that which you cover to be incised because of the discomfort of the patient, and for the flow of air, cover that you place the plaster of ointment completely submerged in corrosive ointment and leave that which is within until that which is corroded is removed of the fat, and care for that which is within until it is healed

And when everything has been evacuated from the abscess of the thigh, then you should fill it up with fat and wash it out the next day.
And return the fat either raw or cured with oil, as convenient to the patient, until he is healed
And if the abscess is of the species of nodes, and of scrofula, then you should divide it open in the same way as we said in the section on scrofula evenly
May the plague be extended in this way that it escapes somewhat reduced, then administer to it with a cautery as we have said above.

From the incision of abscesses that occur by strangulation or by a vein.
When the artery is broken, and the cord is consolidated which is above that, then the veins are seen gaping open that accompany the abscess. It is known that inflammation and abscesses are caused by an artery or vein: for when the abscess is caused by strangulation, it is long associated with the groin of the body; and when it is caused by a vein, sitting in them where there is stridor
And that which is caused by a vein returns to the manifestation of the body
And the incision of this abscess is wrong, especially in those who leave the hairs, and in the armpits, and in the groin, and in many parts of the body; and it is not great, therefore cover that its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is in the limbs, or at the head, should be avoided
But concerning that which is from the inflammation of the orifice of the artery, divide the cord with a section in the long; and immediately cover the section with a bandage and the artery, and deliver from the tunics until it is uncovered
And immediately put on that needle and make that penetrate from one side to the other, and open the artery with a firm double in two places, — which causes and makes you see two arteries that are in the temples.
And immediately put on that needle and make that penetrate between two ligaments with space until the wound is healed throughout, and dissolve the abscess
And immediately administer treatment in which is engendered poor blood until the ligaments fall away; and immediately treat that with oil as is convenient until it is healed
And if the abscess is caused by a vein, then cover that you have with your hand over the abscess with the cord, and immediately insert the needle where you left your hand, and make that penetrate; and be in that fold double until you extract that from the other side, and immediately ligate the abscess with good thread as I have said above.
But if you fear that you will extract the thread, then immediately insert the thread with that needle from the beginning of the abscess, and strengthen the ties in four places.
And immediately dry the abscess in the middle of it until when it is finished there, then you will cut away the surplus of the cord, and leave only what is bound.
And immediately stop over the powder which you have soaked in wine and oil, and immediately administer the treatment which is useful with warm compresses and oil until it is healed
Capital l of the abscess which occurs for the twisting of nerves.
Just as it occurs in an abscess in an artery and in a vein, and in the same way it occurs in nerves when it occurs in their percussion or occurs by excessive work, and for the same reason.
And it is more useful in the places of the attendants or the heel, or in any place where there are inflamed joints
And the abscess is hard, and is like the color of the rest of the body, and is in the greatest of its abundance when it is stretched with great force, sitting in the wound like a stupor.
And it is not associated with the groin of the body, and for so it is left open, and is more painful at all parts and does not go to the preceding or following parts
Therefore, when these humors that are in the joints are not covered with iron, they cause a strong contraction.
If they are in the head or on the forehead, they cause the hair to split. If there is little pus, then cauterize them and remove that which is from the root.
And if it is great, then suspend it with oil, and extract that, and then apply that; and suture the wound, and care for that until it is healed.

This refers to the swelling of the belly that happens when the spleen is cut.
In general, fat people with veins that are swollen in the belly and in other parts of the body of those who are affected by this, are likened to fungi because of their shape, because their root is subtle and their head is big; and their lips are contracted, and it is of those that are little, and it is of those that are not magnificent.
And I have already seen one in whose belly there were two of these people who were like fungi in shape, and there was no difference between the white ones and the dark ones, of little root.
Their lips were inward and swollen, and sweat ran from them all the time
Therefore I conclude that these people should be treated in the same way as the unc and the other like the unc.</start_of_turn>
And the operation in the incision of these people is that you consider if the disease is humid or dry, and if the color of the blood is white, humid, or of subtle root; then you must cauterize with a spatula, and when the fat that is in the belly is expelled, do not leave any residue; and if you see that it is healed, cauterize that area.
And if sometimes the disease is slight and fearful, do not make an incision with iron; rather wait for a recent scab to form, and strengthen that blood, which is the kind that we have mentioned; and let that alone for two days.
And adjust the stricture of the thread of the scab; therefore, do not cease strengthening the scab greatly until it has detached and fallen off by itself
And if it is of great root, then the incision of these people is a cause of fear and dread, especially in those who are in the belly
It is possible that you must make an incision of great extent, and then cauterize that so that it does not return
And care for that until the wound is healed
And keep in mind that you must not presume to make an incision of those who are of yellow complexion, of little sensation, of leg regarding their condition, because those are abscesses
And I remember that sometimes this happens to me too

On the care of great importance of the navel.
The great importance of the navel is useful for many causes; or for cracks of the sac which is over the belly, and these are covered with the cloth or the gut according to what is necessary in other ruptures; or for healing which flows from veins or from intestines as it is said, or for wind that is restricted in it.
If it is for a crack of the sac and for vomiting of the cloth, the color of the pus is similar to the color of the body; and it is painful, and it appears in various positions If it is for the evacuation of the gut, the position of that which we have mentioned above is more diverse, and as you have previously said concerning those who have mentioned that it is hidden, and it returns; and it is strong in that area so that it is magnificent without exceeding the introduction of bath and violent work
If it is for humidity, it is painful and is not hidden when you put your hand on it, nor is it constricted, nor is it swollen
And if it is for healing, the pus appears black and declining.
If it is for nothing, the pus is difficult, thick and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity
If it is for wind, the touch of it is painful
The operation is such that if the swelling of the navel threatens to burst from an artery, or a vein, or from wind, you must refrain from its cure, for in such a case fear and pain are imminent as you have been taught in the chapter where I spoke of the aftercare for an artery and a vein.
If the swelling of the navel threatens the intestines or the skin, then command the patient to sit upright; and place your hand around the navel circuit and command him to lie down between your thighs, and surround the area around the navel with a broad strip of linen; then extend the major part of the incision downwards to the groin; and join in the circuit with a strong suture or a needle and thread of good quality.
Then bring the edges of the incision together over the ligament and insert the needle there and downwards again at the point where you desire to hold the intestine; if you have not found or retained the ligament, then extract the excoriated tissue and push the intestine into the depths of the abdomen
If you have found the skin, take hold of it with one hand; and cut away the excess of it.
May it be contrary to your artery or vein, then surround that part and return to your operation; take two needles and make two strong holes in those two fields and insert two needles into the circuit that you have made around the incision in the manner of a cross, which shall pierce; and strengthen the incision in four parts over the needles.
Or if you wish, keep the needles in and release the extended part until it collapses on its own; or cut that when it is slight and let it go, and care for that which covers the intestines until it is healed
If the swelling of the navel is of fatty substance in it or for moisture, then command to uncover the incision as we have said and extract the fat or moisture which you find in it, and care for that which covers and consolidates the area.

Of the care of a wound.</end_of_turn>
We have already said in the division concerning the nature of wounds and how to treat them with medicines, and that it is dangerous to treat them with iron so that they are not ulcerated; and we have said that wounds are engendered in the marrow and must be treated with care.</end_of_turn>
And the ancients say that certain ulcers never disappear from their place, especially those that are in the armpits or in the groin and in the limbs where it is necessary to remove all that is within, and more so when they are beginning small.</end_of_turn
More when it is ancient and is fat, do not attempt to close it, for I have never seen such an ulcer that has healed by itself, nor have I ever seen another, or that it has been overcome by anything.</end_of_turn
And the operation for it is when it is necessary as we have said, that you precede and remove the patient and purge from the bowels a black vomit of some herbs, and then sprinkle that on it, if it is found.
Then prepare the patient as for the operation in which it is located, and command in the tray nails which cover that; and cover all around with the intestines so that no cause of the cause of the wound remains And leave run the blood, do not bind it too tightly, express the abscesses, and dry the wound thoroughly with your hand or with an instrument which is at your disposal.</end_of_turn
More if it seems contrary to great bleeding from a vein or an artery, then cauterize that until the flow of blood is stopped, and care for that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the care of hydropic swelling.</end_of_turn
We have already recounted in the division concerning the species of hydropic swelling of water, and we have mentioned some of the species, concerning the care of which with medicines.</end_of_turn
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of althites alone, and is not approached with iron to the species of tympani or to the species of yposarcha, for that is mortal.</end_of_turn
And when you have medicated this species of hydropic swelling of the tympani with medicines and do not see improvement in the patient, then consider that if the patient has already achieved debility, or is suffering from another illness, just as if it were in the limbs or the belly and similar to those, do not treat him with iron, for fear is about that.</end_of_turn
May it be that sometimes the patient has excessive thirst, and this is not another disease but merely hydropathy alone, neither young nor old. The way to handle this operation of his is that you elevate his thirst among your most esteemed, and express his belly to him with your hand, fill the water up to the level of the fifth finger, and then take a sponge sponge in this fashion:
Sponge it into two sharp points, wide at the edges like a sponge; however, do this gradually in small amounts, so that during the operation neither one passes into the belly, and that you see that one has stopped.
And consider if the generation of hydropathy is from the bowels, that is why you must remove the section that is three fingers below the navel.
However, if the generation of hydropathy is from kidney disease, then the section should be left three fingers below the navel
If the generation is from the spleen, then the section should be at the flanks.
And do not let the section be over the rib on which the patient is vomiting, so that the fat does not run to that area.
And pierce with the instrument the whole cord, and then enter into that section, and elevate your hand with the sponge between the cord and the liver, and you will expel that; and if the quantity is like a nail or a barleycorn.
And pierce the liver until the sponge reaches the place where the water is And extract that and insert an instrument of this shape: It is similar to a silver needle; it is made of silver or horn or lead, and at the lower part of it is a small hole, and on the sides of it are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and the point is the blunt end of it like a pen
And in the extremity of it is an arm, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that amount of water should be evacuated from the body immediately, because if you evacuate less in an hour, that will mean that the patient will die from the solution of the vital spirit or from injuries approaching death.
Evacuate in this way according to the quantity of the spirit and according to what you understand from the patient's symptoms and from the hardness of his pulse and his degree of thirst.
And extract the instrument, and retain the water which causes it because it is retained by the cord which retains the hole which is over the liver about which you were told to perforate in this way.
And repeat the instrument several times if the patient tolerates it, and evacuate a small quantity of water, and do this for several days in fear, and guard against error until there remains little water left.
However, if you fear the patient, and you see a great quantity of water, then cure that which you will bury in fine sand, and moisten it with bath, and expose it to the sun for a long time; and cure that which you will give drying medicines until he is healed
And cauterize the stomach, the liver and the spleen according to the extraction of the water, as I have recounted above
The treatment is complete.
Concerning the care of children who urinate from the navel, who have not perforated the liver.
Some of the children also excrete from the navel of their mother, and the head of their mixture is not perforated (or the hole is very small or is not in its place).
Therefore it is necessary to cauterize as soon as it is born with a sponge soaked in water according to this manner:
And immediately after that stop the hole with a sponge soaked in lead and bind it, and keep it for three days or for three quarters of a day
When he wants to urinate, let him urinate freely; and then return it.</start_of_turn>
If you do not stop the lead, it is possible that the urine which goes over the place will not be able to pass through the hole.</start_of_turn>
If the hole is small, it is treated with a lead nail as we have said, for several days until it is enlarged.</start_of_turn
If in those in whom the hole is not in its place, that is to say, because of that, that which is born and the hole is at the tip of the verucca so that it cannot urinate downwards, until you elevate the verucca with your hand to the upper parts; and it is not due to hydropathy, for so the sperm cannot reach the mother according to the rule, and it is a bad disease that makes the woman barren.</start_of_turn>
E la manieyra de la operacio in lu es que·l malaute sia envessat sobre le sieu dos, et aprop exten le cap de la vergua de lu am la tua ma sinistra am vehement extraccio, et inscideys le cap del cap de la vergua del loc del perpucii am spatum agut, ayssi cum es inscizio de pluma, o que tu ne razas alcuna partida, per so que·l mieg de lu vengua semblant al cap de la vergua e que le trauc caia en le mieg loc segon que cove.
The manner of the operation is that the patient is turned onto their side, and you extend the head of the vein with your left hand with great extraction, and you puncture the head of the vein of the ankle with a needle, just as if you were making an incision with a pen, or that you do not remove any part of it, so that the middle of the vein remains like the head of the vein and the blood flows into the middle of the limb as before.
Beware that in your surgery of flow of blood, what needles may be happening there; and pause it when you have opened the blood vessel, and cure the wound until it has healed.
Of the ulcer which occurs in the prepuce at the head of the vein and its swelling and blackness and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the vein.
These veins are seen to cause this ulcer at the head of the vein and is an indication of bad blood.
And of those one is malignant and the other is not malignant
Not malignant, because you should suspend it with a single suture and remove that when it is finished; and then pause over that area covered in Egyptian unguent; and then, cure it with diaphontine until it is healed
And if the ulcer is malignant, of dark color, then you must administer cautery nearby the incision and the ratio of it.
May be if the ulcer is in the prepuce at the head of the vein not circumcised, and one part of the ulcer is inwards and the other part is outwards, then you must know that you must remove the part that is inwards until it is consolidated; and when you have cured that outwards, since when you have cured that the prepuce is not split.
And indeed there are accidents that occur in the genitals and in the prepuce black and cracked, where you must know that you must remove all that is already degenerate and that is becoming corrupted or that is already corrupted; and then apply a line over that area nearby with a mixture of flour of millet and barley, with millet seeds and barley barley.
And so cure that with the other cure until it is healed
Beware if there is flow of blood, then administer lunar cautery as follows:
Because the cautery needle is useful in two positions together, that is in the flow of blood and in the wound when it is corrupted
And if the head of the vein is corroded and is destroyed all at once in the hour, then you must insert into the flesh of the prepuce a catheter of lead so that the patient can urinate through that
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the vein (and this adhesion does not occur except in that of which the prepuce is soft, and over which circumcision is not required; and when it occurs in adhesion due to wound or swelling) you must scrape with blunt forceps until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the vein is completely freed
And if it is difficult to remove them completely, then you must scrape with blunt forceps over the head of the vein and the prepuce, and so that the prepuce, when soft, is strongly perforated for its softness.
And then separate between the prepuce and the head of the vein with a piece of lint, which already sticks to the wet water so that it does not adhere to another vein
And so keep it cured with styptic powder until it is consolidated

Of the upbringing of children and the care of what happens to those who undergo circumcision
Circumcision is not a solution to continuity as much as other wounds: indeed, since this is our operation and our will, and because of that it is necessary that we assign in that better operation and way less suffering loss of life.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not order circumcision in any of their holidays, because it is not found in their laws, and it is only because we have learned through experience that the majority of artificers and barbers use to circumcise and to nurture with new herbs and ointments; and they use thread with thread and pin them with nails.
And thus I have already tried all these methods, and I do not find any better remedy than the liament, which is most effective when applied with the fingernail, for it drives out the thick bile which is the cause of the pain, which is contained in two tunics, and leaves the tonica more abundant, and thereby brings about a rapid cessation of the pain. And in this remedy which is useful for the groin, and which is digital, like that which is used by barbers, it is not followed by the incision of the end of the member viril, for it is strong within the cavity of the thigh
More in this operation with the fingernail, force is observed to cause fear and to corrupt your operation. And the bile of the child is short by nature, and thick veins do not exist in such a way that it requires modification, and I have seen this often.</start_of_turn>
More of the modification which is made with the forceps and the ligature and faith, I have experienced disgust at, for the forceps are of such a proportion of incision that the acute that is above is as great as the acute that is below; and therefore as you press your hand so that they are equal, you will make an incision in a time; and it is useful to compress the faith so that it contains the bile of the whole part, to which there is no cause for error of any kind.</start_of_turn>
The first method of the operation is that you should make the child groan more if he is one of those whom I understand to be small, that you should not do anything but lie the faith in its place so simply, and that you should read that which enters within the other day.</start_of_turn
And thus you will make him rejoice in all this manner as much as you are able, with the intelligence that you have received.</start_of_turn And thus you will make him stay between your legs prepared, and do not be sleepy; and hide the forceps in your hand or put them on his foot, so that the child does not see them or any other instruments.</start_of_turn
And thus put your hand on the part and blow in the bile, and pull that which comes out until it comes out to the head of the part, and then modify that which is added to it of mucus.</start_of_turn
The way of the forceps for modification is like this:
The one is blunt at the ends and the other is pointed, so that it does not slip from the nail of the claw, and the length of the two acute angles is as great as the length of two thumbs equally.
And the error in modification is that it drives out the intrinsic bile of the whole, or part of it from the incision.</start_of_turn>
Therefore you must extend that of your hour with your fingernail before the apostemasis of the place and that you make that according to equality.</start_of_turn
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, the hour extract that with your thumb and make that incision.</start_of_turn
And if three days have passed, and the part that is inflamed remains flat from the apostematization of the part, the hour read that which comes out until it is cede the apostematization of the caut, and extract that with ease, and make that incision as you are prepared.</start_of_turn
And take care of the head of the part, so that it does not suffer from that.</start_of_turn
And thus care for that which which the wound has consolidated from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise of the powders.</start_of_turn
And if it is incised on measure of the bile, and you obey to the measures of the parts, that will not be noticed by them.</start_of_turn
And thus care for that which we have said until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Of the care of retained urine in the bladder.</start_of_turn
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by fullness due to stones, sand or gravel, or poverty or meat, and is similar to those we have mentioned regarding the methods of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved by the methods we have mentioned, the cause of the patient’s suffering is the stone, therefore you must administer the extraction of it with an instrument called a siringua, which is like this: made of silver or gold, like a needle with a long body resembling a palm tree, to which is attached a tube of the same material at the top.
The method for extracting the urine is as follows: grasp the bladder with a folded sheet and bind it at the waist with a good knot; introduce the instrument through the opening of the bladder and remove any foreign bodies that may exist. Then insert the catheter into the neck of the bladder with force. Finally, tighten the bladder around the catheter and an album of urine
And make the patient sit on the edge of the bed, and bandage the bladder with a soft cloth and oil of olive and vinegar.
And immediately insert the catheter through the opening of the bladder until it reaches the root of the bladder; then bend the bladder downwards from the navel; then pull out the catheter gently; and finally insert the catheter until it reaches the bladder, and the patient will be relieved of the pain, and this will not be in vain according to this order, but in the meat in which there is pain
And gradually withdraw the catheter with the urine following the thread
Then evacuate the catheter and perform urinary care, and use a siringua, do not stop until the bladder is empty and the patient experiences relief from the pain
Chapter 60
Of what quality should be the irrigation of the bladder with a clamp and what instruments should be used that are appropriate for this purpose
When there is an ulcer or swelling in the bladder, or gravel, or if it is coarsened by poverty, and you want to drain urine and medicines, then it is appropriate to use a clamp, which is like this:
But if it is deaf in the limb, so it is closed And there are three veins: two from one side, thus two times
At the beginning is the bladder, which is filled with water, and according to the quantity that fills that, so much is added, until when any cause is removed from that, that is, when the humidity is evacuated, whether it is by vomiting or by diarrhea, and when it is expelled long, according to how much the clamp tightens that has been placed on the navel in the sea battles
Therefore, when you want to expel humidity from the bladder, insert the clamp into the humidity and drain the water that is filled in those parts, because the humidity is expelled in the concavity of the clamp.
And immediately insert the clamp into the bladder according to what we have recommended in the siringua; and then pull out the clamp, because that humidity will remain in the bladder for the most part, and the patient will be relieved of that pain
The shape of the subtle crystallization in which the bladder is crystallized, and this is the shape:
And it is appropriate to make it of silver or gold, of which the head is similar to a small feather, and to tie it with a thread.
And immediately take the bladder from the movement, and stop the humidity that you want to crystallize in the bladder, and immediately tie that between two strong ligatures with a doubled thread, and heat that humidity over the fire.
And immediately insert the clamp into the bladder
And immediately put your hand over the bladder with the humidity in a descending structure until the patient feels that that humidity has already reached the bladder
May it be that if you do not see a bladder present, take a piece of barley and make a circle of it; and pierce that through its entirety; and then insert firmly into those tracts, even if they are revolted; and then add the circle around it as is added to the alum, because you have rested in that which you wish to expel the humors, and smell and water.
And then you tighten that on the instrument and make it like that as you did with the bladder, and express by your hand that the humor reaches the bladder.
The text ends here.
Extraction of stones from the bladder.
We have already said in the division the species of stones and their care with medicines, and the difference between stones engendered in the humors and stones engendered in the bladder, and we shall tell you of these.
And we have said the stone in which cathes operation is made by me, and section.
And the stone engendered in the bladder itself is that which is fixed in the bladder.
And thus I have narrated that which is exhibition and abreviation.
Therefore I say that the stone which is engendered in the greater bladder mostly appears in children; and of its signs is that the urine which comes out of the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and appears on that sand; and the patient has frequent pain in his belly, and spotted vomit, and he is pale; and in that water lies the root of the stone.
And it is strange the healing of children of that which have reached thirteen years; and the treatment is difficult for the old ones. Better in the young than in the old because it is between these two
And of that of which the stone is greater and the treatment is easier; and if it is little, it is contrary to that
Therefore when we come to the treatment of that, cover at the beginning of that which I have mentioned before that we will modify the pain by making an incision through which we will extract the whole of that which is in the belly; for that incision many times causes vomit which hinders the inquiry of the stone
And thus be present the pain in the belly and the feet and be counted and make vomit again so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it jumps from its place a few times
And thus do that which is between your hands prepared, and the most of them will leave the cushions of their legs, so that the whole bladder may be made to fall down to the flanks of the flanks
And thus require that and all that which surrounds it.
Therefore if you feel the stone in the space, the hour you will cover it so much by incision over it
And if you do not catch it all of a sudden, the hour you touch it with oil you will say with the left hand, if the pain is in a child, or you will say little if it is an adult, and you will put that in the belly And require the stone until it is out of the belly And convert that little by little into the neck of the bladder
And thus do on that which you have said, and expel that to the outside of the body where you saw the incision
Command the minister to hold the bladder with his hand; and command another minister to extend with his right hand the thighs to the flanks, and with his left hand he will grasp the coccyx which is left by the thighs, in the part where the incision is made
And thus insert the sponge be incidental of which this is the shape of them: And split it in them in the water which is between the buttock and the thighs, not in the middle part, behind the left cushion; and the incision is to be made over that stone and the hand is to be held in the buttock, and the incision is to be made transversely, because the incision outside should be wide and the depth should be as much as is necessary for the quantity of stone which comes out to be as little as possible, and not more, for that which is in the buttock the stone because of the incision is pushed forward
And you know that of the stone there is some which has angles and margins, for that its extraction is difficult because of that.
And of that water which is like urine is round, and is made of it the lightness and beauty of it.
Therefore if it is the one from whom the angles and margins are taken, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not thus far removed, then command that you place your hand over that [area], or that you grasp firmly over that [area] in a decent manner, the limb from which it is thus far removed like a limb with a limb above it, and do not depart from it; or that you insert between them the instruments for bending the limb.</end_of_turn>
Or if you do not know how to handle it, then increase slightly the traction, and if you see blood flow, cut off [the supply] of that [poisonous matter].</end_of_turn>
Or if the foot is larger than one, then at the beginning you press your hand to the mouth of the bladder, and immediately pierce over it; and immediately press a little of the liquid there; and do the same if there are more than two [stones].</end_of_turn
And if the foot is large, it is known that you should pierce that large section, because it causes two evils to the patient: that it remains or that it causes a continuous discharge of urine, because the limb is not completely solidified.</end_of_turn>
Or administer the expulsion of it as soon as it is far removed, or perform a fracture of the limb with the forceps until it is extracted in pieces.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe leaves and dragon's blood, and strengthen it.</end_of_turn And rest over that limb immersed in oil and wine, or in scented oil and warm water, so that the burn should be softened.</end_of_turn
And keep the patient sitting on the seat for a while, and do not remove the bandage until the third day.</end_of_turn>
And when that has gone away, bathe the limb with water and oil, and care for it with ointment and balsam until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Or if there is a burn in the wound, adhere and soothe it, and from that it appears as if the blood is frozen in the bladder, and because of this the urine is prohibited (and this is known as the emission of blood with urine), therefore remove the said gut from the wound and extract that blood, because if it remains it will cause the bladder to swell and decay.</end_of_turn
And wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt, and against all spices, with oil that is useful for healing when it is complete.</end_of_turn>
And keep all the cares during all the time that you lie down both thighs and adjust the medicines that were placed over the limb.</end_of_turn
And if the foot is small and is in the meat of the heel, and is fixed there, and there is an emission of urine, then command that you treat that as if it were a section, because that is what is recommended for this care and is accused of section; and already I have mentioned that it is done, and this is how it is done:
with a triangular incision extended, hooked, fixed in flesh.</end_turn>
And take faith, and bind that part so that the foot does not return to the bladder.</end_turn
And immediately insert the needle into the heel, perforating easily until the needle comes out at that foot.</end_turn And rotate the needle on your hand over that small foot, and pierce the perforation of it until you have pierced that of the other side so that the urine will be completely discharged.</start_turn><end_turn>
And then place your hand over what remains of the foot from the part where the heel was removed, because that is squeezed, and is far from the urine, and the patient is healed.</start_turn><end_turn
Or if this treatment does not seem suitable to you for any cause that you prohibit, then bind a thread around the foot and another thread around the foot.</start_turn><end_turn And hold the foot on the heel between the two bands.</start_turn><end_turn And extract that.</start_turn><end_turn And remove the bands and bind the blood with congealed oil that is useful in the wound.</start_turn><end_turn
And it is not necessary to bind the foot tightly, but only to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other band to prevent it from coming out, because when it is loosened the thread will be near the discharge of the foot, the heel will return to its place and will swell the wound.</start_turn><end_turn
And thus it is necessary when you lift the thigh that you elevate the knee towards the parts above, or that you return the heel to its proper place, and take the pulse as we have said.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Extraction of a stone from the kidney.
A stone in the kidneys is rarely engendered.
Moreover, if one sees a stone in any of these, the treatment is difficult and is prohibited by experienced doctors
One of them is that the strong kidney is verging.
The second is that you do not find the kidney well known by the physician when it is cast, or from kidneys having malaria.
The third is that you do not find the kidney well known in this art, most especially the operation with the hand
The fourth is that the location of the incision concerning the stone in the kidneys is far from the location of the stone, because it indicates a pre-existing incision, and in that there is fear.
Moreover, if necessary you must cause it to come out by any means, the hour must be known by the physician, and it is not easily found
Moreover, if you are deprived of this, the hour is close to madness, or presents a mistress or a noble woman who has been injured in the faith of the kidneys, or a kidney which in this art has suffered a loss of part of the organ
Therefore make this presentation, and command her to do whatever you command from the inquiry about the stone until the end; the reason for which is that it regards whether the kidney is verging, the hour that she puts everything aside that you have said in her belly and wants the stone.
Therefore if you find this, close that and leave it aside, and the hour commands her to make an incision about that
Moreover if it is not verging, the hour commands the mistress to enter with all that is said in the belly of the patient and over the stone, since she puts her left hand on the bladder, and confirms that.
Therefore if you find this, the hour commands that gradually one should pull that out from the orifice of the bladder to the lower parts until it reaches the level of the cushion.
And thus make an incision about that appendicitis of the belly that has stopped and centered the stone in that part, and do not touch the stone with your hand from that moment on
And the incision should be small at the beginning; and immediately enter around that incision, and if you feel the stone, the hour adjusts in incision according to the quantity that you know the stone will be freed from that
And know that the species of stones are various: for some are small and great, and yellow and rough, and long and round, and have a ramp
Therefore you know what species they are of them for what you signify about what you want
And if you see a flow of urine, adjust in the wettest part treated and keep her there for an hour until the urine is drained, and then return to your operation until the stone is freed.
And make ready from your instruments which are said in the extraction of a stone in men, so that you are helped with them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of urine, and you know that the expulsion of the urine is from the artery that is incised, the hour that you stop the powder on the location and open that up like dust and stricture descending, and do not touch anything; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for it is strong enough to kill the patient. And take the pulse.
Therefore when the acute pain of the urine has passed a few days, and the location is relaxed, the hour returns to your operation until the stone is freed

On the incision concerning an abdominal hernia.
An abdominal hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white sac which is left by the knee of the genetia containing the urine, and is called a hernia
Every vein that comes from the root of the limb to the outermost part has its own peculiar heat, which is sometimes hot and sometimes cold; and this is the cause of the gout which we mentioned before.
The origin of this hernia is from excessive fat which occurs on the genitals, for in these is poured out this matter, and sometimes it happens by a violent point made on the genitals.
And this moisture has various colors, for its color is sometimes red or tending to orange or blood-stained, or on the contrary, black feculent, or white watery, and this is the best
These signs from which it is understood that this accumulation of water is there: for if it is in the white pith which we mentioned before, then its tail is rounded, declining slightly in length like a figure of water, and the genitals appear, for the moisture contains all around.
And if the moisture is in the root of the limb, then its tail is round at the part of the water and by this we know that it is another water
And if the moisture is between the root of the genitals and the white pith, then we must leave it untouched
And as for the knowledge of the color of the moisture, then you must describe the color of the moisture in the swelling along with the surrounding skin, following the shape that precedes it; and according to what is seen in the remnants of the surrounding area, judge what is its origin
Therefore when we come to the treatment of this matter, we must command the patient to rest if it is possible, and sometimes we must put their body under pressure
And immediately rest on both sides about any cause a little high, and place a little cloth under them
And immediately sit on the left side of them, and command the servant to follow the right side of them, who extends his hand to the groin as far as two palms from the root of the genitals to the part of the navel of the belly
And immediately take hold of the foot and split the root of the genitals from the middle to the tip along the length almost to the heel.
And make the incision according to the rule equally distant from the line that should be drawn on the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white pith including it
And evacuate that, and observe, and take care that you do not perforate that; and evacuate your wound along with which you evacuate by part as much as possible, and write your evacuation clearly according to the quantity that is possible for you
And immediately pierce the full pith of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water
And immediately separate between two layers the edges of the incision with nails, and stretch the pith outwards; and do not touch the root of the genitals including it, and insert the pith in that manner that is possible for you And insert it in its entirety or in pieces, and especially the two lateral margins, because if you do not carefully examine the incision of them, it is not certain that the water will not return
If however the water proceeds from that beyond its root at the time of your operation, when you have completed the incision of the pith, return that which has escaped, and immediately suture the two edges of the root of the genitals, and take care of it as you would of the other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the water corrupted by another disease, then you must tie up the vessels which are its sources, and extract the water, and take care of it as we have said.
And if the water is gathered in two parts, it is known that there are two hernias; therefore insert that part according to what you have done to the other equally; and if you see that it is a surgical operation, then do it.</start_of_turn>
And immediately wash your hands, and enter the wound with clean linen submerged in oil or in scented oil; and place another clean linen which you have submerged in wine and oil over two genitals and the belly; and cover that with clean cloths and dust, and tie those up in the way mentioned above:
And immediately take two cloths and fill them with coarse linen according to this shape; and tie the extremities with which it is customary to tie coto or wet linen, and bind them with a structure at the groin of the thighs, and one of the extremities preforms the buttock within the two, and the second preforms the side of the hip, and two extremities over two thighs and two others over two ankles, and bind all the structures tightly in the groin of the thighs.</start_of_turn
Every vein that carries this hernia artificially with cautery in the place of incision with a needle; take cautery of a subtle kind and insert it into that place where the codena of the genitals is. Light it according to what we have recommended until the white sack containing the water is discovered, and then take cautery in this manner. Every vein that carries this hernia artificially with cautery in the place of incision with a needle; take cautery of a subtle kind and insert it into that place where the codena of the genitals is. Light it according to what we have recommended until the white sack containing the water is discovered, and then take cautery in this manner. And it is assembled like the Greek letter.
And then perforate that sack, and light it until all the moisture is driven out
And then stretch the sack with nails, and scour with nails, and scour with pointed cautery ignited; and insert that according to what is possible until you have eradicated all of it. And keep away from the heat that the fire does not touch you
And know that this operation is more safe and more long-lasting than an incision.
May it be contrary to your custom to cauterize in the hour of incision or in the hour of cautery, or to bleed; however, know that you must care for whatever discomfort you make to him by this, with care which you are accustomed to give them according to what is said
May it be contrary to your custom to cauterize in the hour of incision or in the hour of cautery, or to bleed; however, know that you must care for whatever discomfort you make to him by this, with care which you are accustomed to give them according to what is said. May it be that the patient is weak, and does not expect the second operation on account of its horror; however, when it is certified that this is necessary, as we have said of the significances, that that hernia is helpful.
Know that you must keep the patient still on any elevated surface, and then perforate the apostema in the lower part of the limb at the edge of the heel, and stop the perforation according to the length of the limb.
And let the incision be wide enough to drain out all the water.<end_turn>
And then place over the area the hand and bind that and leave that, so that the water remains there.<end_turn> And take care that the wound is healed.<end_turn>
May it be that if there is contrary to the evacuation of the water at that time you perforate that: and that is not useful except for that which causes the white sac in the orifice of the wound to make contrary and hinders the escape of the water; know that you must put in the wound some ointment or instrument with which to extract the water from the bladder, the manner of which is preceded; or apply in the oppression of the wound a little sponge.
And know that the water returns, and is increased about six months or in February; and when it is increased, the perforation must be made according to that manner, so that the patient will not suffer for seven days.<end_turn

Of incision concerning carnosa hernia and its care.</end_turn
Know that in the incision concerning this hernia there is fear of loss of sensation in the greater parts; for I have seen the diminution of them and their being saved for that better thing.</end_turn
And I remember the operation concerning this and the kinds of apostemas.</end_turn
Therefore, I say that apostemas are born in the limbs of which the genitals are composed and are useful for many causes: or for sudden excessive swelling which is spread to the genitals, or for percussion.</end_turn
And the color of the apostema is according to the color of the limb, and is not found in pain, and is a hard apostema.</end_turn
And strong is the soft apostema, of which the color is dark, and is not related to the wound.</end_turn
And every vein that carries this hernia artificially with cautery in the place of incision with a needle; take cautery of a subtle kind and insert it into that place where the codena of the genitals is. Light it according to what we have recommended until the white sack containing the water is discovered, and then take cautery in this manner.</end_turn
May it be that which is for the swelling of the arteries is known by the dispersal of the apostema when you compress that with the thighs said; and do not touch that.</end_turn
May that which is for the swelling of the veins is not dispersed by any cause of must be compressed with the said thighs.</end_turn
And it is possible that concerning this species it is useful to make an incision and over the rest of the flesh; and that you insert the codena of the genitals, and then stretch the blood to the lower parts, and extract that from the white sac, and discharge the phlegmas from the veins, and ligate those, and insert those phlegmas more than you discharge from every part of the blood.</end_turn
Therefore if the humour has already solidified in those cartilages, you must extract it and instill new.
And if there is adherence between any cause of the cipah, or between that which is between the veins, you must remove all such adherence and instill new in its place.</end_of_turn>
Moreover if it is born from marrow in the place of the adherence which is behind, you must instill all that is of it, and extract the humour as we have said.</end_of_turn>
Therefore when your operation is complete, fill the wound with soft wool soaked in olive oil and vinegar; and take care of the other care until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XLV.</end_turn>
Of the care of hernia which is of the gut.</end_turn>
The gut is swollen and surrounded by any covering resembling a sprout with mollification of the testicles, and it is difficult for the patient to exercise movement and walk on the affected side.</end_turn
And in the care of this disease is to fear from what precedes the memory.</end_turn
However we must say the operation in that way that the first ones suffer.</end_turn
I say that you should make the patient lie on a high cushion; and support the testicles with cushions to the sides; and place the knee of the thighs against the groin over the veins that are proved to be painful; and have the other attendants that you like, and extend those that you wish with violent extension.</end_turn
And then make an incision with a sharp knife across the belly of the veins until they are discovered.</end_turn
And then evacuate completely from all parts as we have said in the extraction of the intestine which are in the temples.</end_turn
And leave in those a needle with a double knot, and tie one at the front of the place where the wound was made, and tie the other at the back of them.</end_turn And then make an incision in the middle of the leg for a straight cut according to the length of the limb, and extract what is added of the foul and corrupt humors.</end_turn
And take care of the wound with the care of other wounds so that the veins that accompany the two testicles do not break, which is not harmful in this case.</end_turn
Moreover if all the veins are broken, you must extract the testicles or that the testicles because of the breaking of the veins, because it is private of all nourishment for the propagation of the veins, and that they are solidified, or that they are equal so that they are not harmful to them.</end_turn
Chapter LXV.</end_turn
Of the care of intestinal hernia.</end_turn
The occurrence of this hernia is for incision that extends on the cipah extended over the belly from the flanks to the navel, because by giving way the bulges of that break are brought to the belly of the intestines.</end_turn
And this break is of the cipah or of excess of it, and it occurs for various causes: or for percussion, or for vomiting, or for crying, or for elevation of any cause, or for similar things.</end_turn
And the sign of this is that it occurs little by little over a long time, and does not occur suddenly, and is swelling that enters within the belly so that the cipah compresses the intestine.</end_turn
And the sign of this is when it occurs suddenly with violent pain at the beginning; and is swelling different from the apparent outside the navel, and that is for the bursting of the intestine, and the body of the hernia to the flanks of the cipah.</end_turn
And many doctors forget about the gut the membrane, and call this intestinal hernia.
And some doctors are useless with wind, and some doctors run in the belly wound, and here it is retained, and it is in this way that it brings great discomfort to the patient, and some doctors make it worse by causing great pain and most of all when pressing.</end_turn
And in the treatment of these diseases of this disease there is fear, for that you must avoid the cause in that case.</end_turn
And the manner of the operation of that is that you command the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand to the depths of its concavity if he obeys your return order, and then be covered over his belly between your legs, and raise his legs.</end_turn
Then tighten the clamp which holds the testicles to the lower parts, and with a pointed instrument incision the testicles throughout their length; and then fix two lips of the incision as you would to open the incision with those.
If the incision according to the quantity that you are able to bear can be completely forgotten.</end_of_turn>
Then remove the discharge which remains from the testicles until the white tough membrane covering any part is discovered.</end_of_turn
Then bring out the bladder which is said to be under the testicles, in which is between the white membranes which is left from the testicles, and the other from the scrotum, and remove anything that adheres to that part behind the testicles.</end_of_turn>
And put your hand on the clamp of the testicles towards the front, and with the left hand extend the white membrane over the hand, and elevate the testicles towards the incision; and command the assistant to extend the testicles outwards and you dissolve the adherence that is behind the incision after it has been completed.</end_of_turn
And know that there is no cause for the intestine being covered in the tough white membrane.</end_of_turn Or if you find any cause, then leave it in the belly.</end_of_turn
And pierce the part behind the testicles for the incision from which blood will flow freely and safely as we have recommended above.</end_of_turn
And administer lard submerged in oil, and place it on the wound; and administer the ligature which we have recommended (since several veins around the white membrane are cauterized, which we mentioned before causes the fear of blood flow, which often happens in these places).
If the case is delayed, cold water should be placed around the area, and leave it on until it falls as we have said.</end_of_turn
And take care of the wound with the other care of wounds until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

Of the windy hernia.</end_of_turn
In this hernia nothing has been seen that has been useful in its treatment.</end_of_turn
And first they say that it is useful just as we have recommended in the hernia which is in the belly; which is that you tie the blood vessels near the incision so that they are facilitated; and dry the area around the wound in the belly in order to remove the swelling that is in it, until the blood vessels fall down.</end_of_turn
And take care of the wound as we have said until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the dislocation which is useful in the joints.</end_of_turn
In some cases a break must be made in the joints as we have said, and examine the area.</end_of_turn
And do not suspect any cause of swelling at the knee; and if you suspect it, it is little; and return immediately.</end_of_turn
Or if it is prolonged, make an incision in the intestine until the swelling has gone down; and this is done because the intestine is stretched and the area is swollen, and this is because the intestine is extended, and therefore is softened and the area is relaxed and examined.</end_of_turn
The care of them is to make incisions after the narration of their condition.
Each case is cured by cautery according to this manner: and that the patient lies down with two attendants at their thighs and another at their chest, holding their hands.
And then stretch the white cloth that is under the knee until it is discovered
And then take the forceps and place one over the prominent part of the intestine, and press the other against the flank.
And then clamp the two prominent parts over the extremity of the intestines, and suture one to the other
And then extract the extremity of the intestines, and do not insert the intestines further, neither extend the blood vessels, nor anything else in this way as I will tell you in the treatment of intestinal hernia
And then care for the wounds, and when they have bled, moisten that and restore the wound until it is solidified; for the intestine is contracted and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted
And the incision is better in this place, because it is more likely to heal well.

Treatment of the knee of the testicles.
The swelling of the knee of the testicles in acute cases is softened by the application of warm compresses, because the surrounding tissues are softened, and it is fed from them
When it is necessary to make an incision in the treatment of this, let the patient lie down with two attendants at their thighs and another at their chest, holding their hands. Then clamp the entire knee which is softened over the natural knee; and suture two lips together.
Or if you wish, clamp the swelling of the softened knee with three stitches or four and with a firm suture
And then insert between the sutures; and care for the healing of the others wounds until they are healed and the bleeding has stopped

Of castration
Wisdom has it that castration is forbidden in our laws, however I recall it in this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except for two cases. The one is when the physician is questioned about it, for he should know how to cure it. The other case is when we must castrate other animals for our food, such as pigs, horses, goats, and the like.
Therefore I say that castration is useful in two ways: by traction or by incision to the root
In that case where traction is useful, the way of performing the operation is to immerse the animal in cold water until the testicles are softened and limp and hanging down And then take hold of them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to be touching each other
And in castration that is useful by incision and cutting, grasp the animal and hold the knee of the testicles with your left hand
And then ligate the surgeon, and make an incision over every blood vessel with a section so that two veins protrude.
And then make the incisions more than enough that there may be no further tearing Do not worry about any bleeding from the wound, but rather the delicate skin over the veins
This method of castration is better than traction, for traction causes strong pain and often leaves any cause of the testicles because the animal desires to bite
And care for the wound until it is healed

Of the care of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is according to two methods: when there is an opening in the knee of the testicles in which the space between two testicles appears to be a female organ in which a fetus is found
And some women of that age urinate in the knee of the testicles
The pain in the knees is like that of two testicles of a man, a little more at the front and a little less at the back.
There are three methods of treatment: two for men and one for women. Therefore you must remove the swollen flesh until the footprint of the disease has vanished, and then treat the remaining wounds as for other ailments.
As for the second method for men, which is the one that produces urine in the testicles, there is neither treatment nor operation for that.
(The text continues with several more lines, but I will not translate them without further context.)
Women often suffer from severe and prominent ailments.
The great swelling often arises from natural causes, and is rightly regarded as such; and some women suffer from it to such an extent that it expands just as much in women as in men, and even during coitus.
Therefore remove the swelling with your hand or with an instrument and instill it.
Do not hesitate to perform the incision, especially in the area of the root of the hair, so that the blood does not clot
And treat the remaining wound as for other ailments until it is healed
Every wound is born in the horror of the mother, until it fills up again, and great swelling is seen at the front just as much as at the back according to its custom (and thus the first ones call it “disease caused by cold humors”). Therefore we must treat it just as we would a swelling, and cure it when it is healed.
(The text continues for several more lines, but I will not translate them without further context.)
Treatment of the toothache.
A toothache is when the tooth is not perforated, or is only slightly fractured It is either natural or accidental
Accidental is due to an illness that preceded it, or is caused by a wound or an injury caused by a hard or soft object
It is caused either in the front of the face, or on the sides, or on the back of the head, or in the hollow of the cheek, and it prevents talking and eating, and spitting, and even menstruation.
The knowledge of that is useful for diagnosis, if the swelling is evident, it is necessary; even if it is not evident, when you suspect it from the pain or from the touch
Even if the swelling is caused by a soft object, and is placed on the two lips, you should bite down and break it apart
And hold your tongue over the two lips, and when you bite down it indicates that there are many teeth.
The woman should be positioned over the two feet, the thighs spread apart, and hold the two lips open with force until that soft object is broken and the swelling is opened
Then take linen and wet it in oil and put it on the area, and keep it there until the area does not harden.
Even if the swelling is large and hard, you must remove it with a sponge soaked in oil or with a piece of myrtle leaf
If the swelling is caused by a wound, then suspend that with one hand and perform the incision with the other hand
And give them the medicines that stop the flow of blood, such as acacia, and sage, and alum, adjusted with egg white.
And give her a wide needle of lead so that the wound is not solidified too much
Keep her for several days and give her powdered licorice
And treat the wound with other methods of consolidation until it is healed
Many times various wounds arise from other wounds, and you must treat them according to this manner If there is a fistula in the face, the fistula of the face which is in the mouth should not be treated in any way with iron.

From the care of hemorrhoids and tailbone and red boils that occur in the groin of women.
Hemorrhoids are recognized from the openings of blood vessels within that they cause continuous bleeding; and when they are ancient, they are called felons.</end_of_turn>
And already I have said in the division of these kinds that I have mentioned before, and I say thus that those who receive care and those who do not receive care.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and felons when they are in the belly and do not appear to the feeling, the hour in those is not to make use of care.</end_of_turn
But those which are in the orifice of the belly about which they feel sensation, are cured.</end_of_turn>
And cover that the woman is in great pain and approach the heel with forceps, or with rough hands, and prick them with the roots.</end_of_turn
And approach powder over those from which flows the blood of one of the veins incisions so that it is softened like this and looks like that.</end_of_turn
And then keep the feet covered for an hour, and then stop that in cold water.</end_of_turn
And if the bleeding persists, the hour that will be made will be decoction of wine and of poppy seeds and of barley and of honey and of appearance.</end_of_turn
And take barley porridge and comfort that with honey and vinegar and make plaster with water over both of them.</end_of_turn
And if the blood is shed, it is bad; but if not, make them adhere to two cushions, and to the breasts offer sacrifice.</end_of_turn
And take vinegar and immerse that in the juice of rue or in the juice of marigold or in the juice of gentian with white wine and make them adhere to the area; and care for the area with ointment until it is healed.</end>

Of the perforation of an abscess that happens in the belly.</start_of_turn>
There are various species of abscesses that occur in the belly, such as carbuncles and abscesses of the spleen and ulcers and tumors and hernias and piles and boils and abscesses and ruptures and fistula of hemorrhoids and wounds and other abscesses.</start_of_turn And I have already said these diseases and their species and their symptoms, and their cures in the division.</start_of_turn
And I say in this treatise of abscesses that come in the belly when it is of the abscesses that accompany healing, and if you want to know in what manner this operation is made for them.</start_of_turn
Therefore consider if the pain of the abscess in the heel at the beginning is acute with percussion and swelling and fever, and sometimes when it covers that sensation, the hour does not suffice for the perforation of them, and care for that which helps with the maturation until the acute of the accidents ceases.</start_of_turn
And the hour covers that you make the woman lie on a cushion that has two cushions; and recline on the heel two cushions and adjust the feet of the patient to the part below the belly, and that the thighs be expanded, and stop the knees from the ankles, and tie whatever is convenient to it.</start_of_turn
And the nurse follows the doctor and administer the instrument with which the opening of the belly is made, the form of which will come in those causes that will make it necessary.</start_of_turn
And cover when you are going to administer this instrument that you stay with the patient's belly in the palm of your hand, and that what comes out of the instrument into the belly is not more than the belly itself and does not harm the patient.</start_of_turn And if the instrument is larger than the belly, the hour covers that you sprinkle powder over the texture of the belly so that no other instrument can enter the belly.</start_of_turn
And cover that you remove the vomiting that runs in the instrument from below and that the minister has the instrument and turns the vomiting until the opening of the belly is made.</start_of_turn
When the patient appears, and is grasped by the hand and is lion and limping, then cover that part with a sheet of lead.
When the urine is evacuated, then cover the plaque with a vessel submerged in olive oil or green oil in which there is any spasm; and keep the heel pressed down in the area of the major bone
And press down the great toe and cover the fifth with clean wool submerged in water in which there are boiled almonds.
And keep it treated for two days until it is healed. Enter it into the water until it is healed
Each vegetable is washed, the great toe and the plaque are cleansed with vinegar that is crystallized with water and honey, and then with water in which lilies or long-stalked fennel are boiled, and finally return to the wound
And if the plaque is hardened in the great toe, then you must refrain from treating it with iron, having treated it with that which we have said in the division.

To teach the midwives how they should behave towards women who are giving birth according to an unnatural figure.
A necessary cause is that the midwife knows at the beginning the figure of natural childbirth through her senses, and that when the woman screams out from her bowels and desires to smell the air, and about which she is relieved by what is above her, and that she vomits, the hour is that this part is according to the natural figure, and that is the vomiting on the head, and the second one at the navel or suspension or pendency of the navel.
Therefore when you see those symptoms, cover the belly so that the embryo is slightly pressed downwards when it comes out on the head, so that it is not exposed to the superfluities with good management
If another part is not natural and not useful, because when the embryo comes out on its feet and the body comes out before the head and the feet, and the hand or the foot is at the side, or at the heel, etc Or the head is out and the hand is at the side, or at the belly, and it is converted into the navel, and it is like the unnatural figures
A necessary cause is that the midwife be wise and discreet in all those cases, and that she guard against error and deception
And I have shown you all the figures of those things, and what is their meaning so that you know what is significant and what is not
When the fetus comes out head first naturally, and that is vehement with the woman and is useful to her, and sometimes the virtue of the thing is already diminished, the hour is that one should make her do what the women have to do, and drive away the disgust with fennel seeds and with fragrant oil.
And immediately insert the midwife between the thighs and say a little space there, or cut that one at the navel or cut that one at the tip of the navel until it comes out what is in it of humidity And press the belly of the woman until it gives birth to the fetus.
If it does not give birth, the hour is that the woman should be solidified with mucus of peas and fennel mucus with resin.
And command her to keep still, to press and make her vomit; and keep her mouth and nose covered for an hour, so that the fetus will be expelled as much as possible
And if the two parts of the fetus are expelled from the beginning, the hour is that you should reduce them little by little. If it does not obey the order, the hour is that you put the woman on a cushion and lift her feet up, and then put the cushion on the ground; and the woman should be taken that she does not fall from the concussion
If the parts are not delivered and the fetus dies, the hour is that you will extract the fetus or tie the body to her hand and extract that which is equal, so that that which is expelled will be forgotten
When the fetus comes out on the thighs, the hour is that you press those down, and immediately convert the fetus small, and that you grasp that one, and that you take hold of a leg and extend those little by little
May it be thus. When he sits within the thighs, command him to express himself, and make him extend himself with condiment, for if he forgets it, God willing.
And if he does not forget what we have recommended, when you return the little finger gradually until you reach the second natural figure, for at that time he will remember it with delight.</end_of_turn>
And if it is forbidden in all that we have recommended, then take high musellage and dissolved gum, and pierce all over the ankle for good percussion, and press against what you know of the woman, the pus from her belly.</end_of_turn> And do that which will cause the water to rise, until you see the bubbles rise up.</end_of_turn>
And when the parts have become softened, make them undergo fumigation with myrrh and stop that for them.</end_of_turn And when the fumigation has lasted for an hour, command him to lie down on a cushion, and make him extend himself and open his mouth, and take away from that, and press the lower part of his belly with your hand, for it will be remembered with delight.</end_of_turn
Indeed from the lateral aspect pending one of his hands.</end_of_turn> Thus you will perform the reduction of the hand, even if you are unable to achieve that, command the woman to rise up and let her go.</end_of_turn
And if she cannot go, command her to sit on the thighs, and beat the patient's thighs with great percussion, and give him medicinal herbs and recommend mucilages.</end_of_turn
And if he becomes faint, command him to lie down on a cushion, and study the reduction of the hand, and gently resume him according to the natural figure, and make her extend her foot and command her to breathe deeply until he forgets it.</end_of_turn
Indeed from the fet over the thigh expand his hands and the surface of his foot is at two of his greatest.</end_of_turn When the matron has the hand of the fetus and gently rotates that little by little, and that will facilitate it.</end_of_turn
When it is thus and when it is relaxed, and command him to rest on the knowledge of what we have recommended of oil and mucilages.</end_of_turn
And command him to move his hand little by little, and when he feels better, command him to lie down on a cushion and command him to be inclined to the left side, and command him to be squeezed; and make her extend herself with condiment.</end_of_turn The fetus is prepared to come out on the wide side.</end_of_turn
When they see the horror of the mother in this manner, consider, and when you have grasped her second finger until it is evacuated from the moisture.</end_of_turn
And if the fetus is suspended on the face and the thigh, command him to grasp that of the navel, so that it is not retained and remains.</end>
And command the fetus to be placed on the parts downwards until it pauses that moment when she covers, and command the woman to compress herself several times, and he will remember it with delight, if God wills it.</end_of_turn
The birth of twins or many fetuses.</end_of_turn It is known that twin spotted girls are born, and sometimes three or four, although this is strange and harmful; for it is not from the natural course of things, and is not life-giving.</end_of_turn
And indeed, whether they be multiplied once, twice, or are separated by a cicatrix, distinguish those within the ligament in the navel of each of those veins which have become veined so far as to be forgotten like this by nature itself, and so remain some veins which by nature are not able to be used for this purpose.
And if they are difficult to dissect from each other, you must burst them forth and come to that which we have mentioned of the unnatural figures, for in this way you will care for them as we have recounted.</end_of_turn>
And if the mistress of the household makes it subtle and does what facilitates and clarifies and avoids delay, and is ingenious according to the whole figure as she has prepared it from the impending danger to health.</end_of_turn>
Remember that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.</end_of_turn
Some women have their periods once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, seven times, and sometimes ten times. And it has been observed that a woman who has her period every six months has a total of ten periods in her life, and another who has them every month has a total of twelve periods in her life, which causes great pain according to the reckoning of the wise men
And all this is so that the mistress of the household should be skilled in that part which relates to that little girl who resembles her, and therefore she should order that it be stopped.</end_of_turn
Chapter CLXVI.</end_of_turn>
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.</end_of_turn
When you care for a dead fetus, as we have said in the division of medicine, and it does not escape your notice, and you wish to use an operation for it, then you must consider whether the woman is of sound mind and is not subject to any of the accidents for which she is feared to be at risk.</end_of_turn
Then you must make the woman lie down on her side, with her head inclined downwards and her thighs raised up.</end_of_turn
And the minister should hold her two hands or bind her in the side so that the body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.</end_of_turn
And then you should moisten the mouth of the mistress of the household with oil of olives and mucus of alum, fennel and hemlock seeds and sesame seed.</end_of_turn
And then put your hand on the mistress of the household with those oils and mucus, and enter with your hand into the belly to facilitate it, and grasp with your hand the part where the nails are in the fetus.</end_of_turn
And look conveniently in that place: when you consider that the fetus is prepared, that it should be delivered head first, and while you hold the nails in the heel of the foot, or in the heel, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or leave the beard, or the tonsils, or in the proper places of the flanks, or leave the navel cord.</end_of_turn
Even if delivery is made on the feet, nevertheless at the fifth or in the middle of the flanks.</end_of_turn
And keep your thumb with your left hand, and suspend the curvature of the limb in that place which is between the wrist of your left hand, and enter your hand to facilitate and keep the thumb in some of those places which we have mentioned, until you reach the cause of the pain.</end_of_turn
And so stay still and remain in the position of the limb another thumb, or the third if necessary, so that it is an equal attraction, and not an extension according to its rectitude alone.</end_of_turn
And so be patient at all times, so that the suffering of the limb is relieved as much as possible, just as it is done in the teeth because of the eradication of the cause.</end_of_turn>
And so be careful in them that the extension is softened; and if any limb is retained, then you must order the mistress of the household to join with her nails those which we have mentioned with oil and enter those with expectation and rotate those which are retained.</end_of_turn
So if the limb of the fetus is expelled, then hold the nails together in that place which is most appropriate; and do this until the whole fetus is expelled.</end_of_turn
May be if the hand is swollen outwards from the other, and it is not possible to reduce it due to the patient's condition, then cover that part with a bandage; and extract that which is outside, and puncture that or at the wrist.
And also cover the other hand and the two feet.</end_of_turn>
When the foot swells up, or if there is swelling of the joint with water retained, or if the water is tightly adjusted in the head, it is necessary to interpose between these spines a sponge and cut off the head and extract the water, or to drain it with an instrument which is called “alundat,” whose form will be like that of the other instruments in the chapter which is adjacent to this.</end_of_turn>
Similarly do in the case of a large foot: then puncture that with the cautery, or better yet, place the cautery over that as we have said; and extract the bones with forceps.</end_of_turn
And if the head is swollen and is contracted, break the fetlock; then the moisture which is in the feet will be evacuated.</end_of_turn>
When it is not complicated, or does not obey these methods, then prick the head as much as you can according to your skill.</end_of_turn
And if there is swelling of the belly or if it is in hydropsy, then extract that which is outside so that the moisture in it is driven out.</end_of_turn
When the foot is over the ankles, the traction of the limb is light and the direction of the limb towards the mouth of the heel is light.</end_of_turn
When it is contracted, grasp the foot and the ankle; then extract that which is covering your hand, and cut off the belly and the ankle so that the water which is in them escapes.</end_of_turn
When the other members are relaxed and the head is turned, the left hand is introduced; when the mouth of the heel is gaping, insert the hand into the groin, grasp the head, and pull that which is between the toes towards the mouth of the heel, and at the same time introduce one or two nails there and pull them out towards those.</end_of_turn
And if the mouth of the heel is closed by swelling, do not bite down too hard on it; better to administer an ointment of greasy humors.</end_of_turn Apply compresses; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisten.</end_of_turn>
And if the foot is over the ankle bone, if possible, it is necessary to puncture it: and administer what has been said about the foot above.</end_of_turn
And if that is not possible, prick in the flesh, and extract it.</end_of_turn
And do not omit any cause of the second kind.</end_of_turn
When you have completed all your work, then administer what has been said about aftercare for the bites caused by the heel.</end_of_turn
And if there is bleeding, send for styptic powder and administer the other care.</end_of_turn>
And indeed I have seen a woman with a dead foot in the belly, and over that I placed another bandage, and over that the other foot died.</end_of_turn It happens often that long-term swelling in the ankle bone; and when it is full of blood, it begins to swell outwards.</end_of_turn
And I have been called to care for them, and I have treated them for a long time, but the plague has not subsided.</end_of_turn
Then I placed over them some strong traction plasters, and extracted one bone, and passed a few days, and extracted another bone; and I was amazed that in the belly there was no bone.</end_of_turn
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead foot.</end_of_turn
Therefore I continued to treat the plague, and I extracted from her all the bones, for the woman exists in this world in many ways, and I have seen her in this way for a long time, corrected by a little bandage.</end_of_turn
And I did not cease to be astonished, but rather that in this matter there is knowledge and an assistant at hand for the physician to administer care.</end_of_turn
From the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fet.
The way to handle the major: ...</start_of_turn>
This is the method of holding the limb in which the veins are grasped, to which two incisions are made at the ends of two toes.</start_of_turn> May, however, this incision must be made more subtle than the strictor, and should be made with a cautery or needle or thread of boys.</start_of_turn
And the width of each hole is as much as two fingers, and the distance from the thumb to the little finger is as much as one finger; and the length of each is a palm and a half; and between two holes there are two adjustments of that middle finger which are already fixed, the length of which is that of two palms and a little, and the width of each is as much as two fingers, or a little more.</start_of_turn
And these two additional incisions are introduced into the mouth of the major so that it is open at those points when you rotate the two prescribed incisions.</start_of_turn
Another similar method, which is more subtle and lighter: ...</start_of_turn
Either with a needle or thread of eba or boys according to the form of forceps.</start_of_turn But in the extremity of the limb there are two additional incisions like this, and the length of these incisions is as much as one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.</start_of_turn
And when you want to open the major, then do make the limb flex downward over the pelvis, open what is between the thighs of the patient.</start_of_turn And bring your hand close to the instruments like forceps according to the amount you want of the opening of the mouth of the major until the uterus makes so that you can see.</start_of_turn
The way of handling the limb which the ancients called ...</start_of_turn
The method of grasping the fetus: ...</start_of_turn
The method of holding the great head: ...</start_of_turn
And it is similar to forceps to which teeth are inserted at the extremity, like this, and sometimes veins are made long like forceps according to this method, like this, to which teeth are inserted like teeth of a saw in which the incision is made and the fetus is contained.</start_of_turn Method of slight handling: ...</start_of_turn
Method of grasping with a single nail: ...</start_of_turn
Method of grasping with two nails: ...</start_of_turn
Method of cutting with two extremities to which the head is amputated: ...</start_of_turn
Method of two broad spatulas: ...</start_of_turn
All these instruments are exercises, and when they are multiplied the species of these will be prepared by the artificer, when it is more necessary for the operation and more convenient for the people who carry it out.</start_of_turn
And do not work with these instruments either already, or must you appear to do so, for the necessity of these is not excusable.</start_of_turn
Extraction of the second part.</start_of_turn
When the second part is retained you must support the abdomen, and order the patient that they expel the seed bag, and immediately order them to evacuate that stomach through the mouth and over the thighs, and if by this means it is forced out, well and good.</start_of_turn
And if not, then take an ointment and make a hole in the covering with a needle and stop in that herb that opens the mouth of the major, like camomile and rue and ivy and chamomile and saffron and Arabic gum and cassia lignea and rue blanche.</start_of_turn All these herbs or some of them are immersed in water in the ointment, and stop that on the fire.</start_of_turn
And bring close a tube of canewater to the mouth of the major, and keep that inside until the vapor comes out to the cavity of the major.</start_of_turn
And do that as we have said, and the second part will be expelled with speed.</start_of_turn

De curacio de las fistulas que endeveno dejos.
The fistulas that arise in the lower parts of the legs are notable and numerous, and arise from the groin or in the space of the buttock.
And it is a fistula or swelling.
And when that swelling is old and corrupted by the white or putrid moisture, and some veins are seen to penetrate from these fistulas.
And those that penetrate are known because they are driven out by the evacuation and the wind; and some veins use the patient's evacuation, and it is very strong that it is driven out from them.
And from these fistulas some veins penetrate into the bladder, and into the marrow of the bone; and some penetrate into the joint of the thigh and into the bone of the knee.
And it is known that a penetrating fistula that enters the groin is not penetrating, that you must tell the patient to lie down in the groin, and that you must attempt to remove the cause or the stone in the fistula when it is not crooked.
If it is crooked, then enter into that attempt with lead or horsehair until you sit on the vein or hold it in the groin.
And if you do not sit on that or if you do not succeed in any way in removing the cause of evacuation or stone or wind, as we have said, then it is known that it is not penetrating, and you must be content with the treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates the bladder or the marrow of the bone, it is known that it is of urine from that place and that it is forbidden to drink until the area is solidified by medical treatment.
And if it penetrates the thigh joint or the bone and causes pain in the limb, it is known that the vein has burst into the bone if it is not crooked, and causes pain in the limb of the part; and that from it urine is excreted; and that it is of no use in this treatment, nor is it solidified by this treatment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas, treatment is not enough, and the treatment of these is the work and uselessness of the doctors who have stopped it.
And in that one that is not penetrating and does not worsen, healing with iron is expected as I will tell you to recommend, and that which I have already tried and proved.
And it is that you must place the patient between your knees and elevate the legs above their level, the thighs are inclined towards the patient's belly, and then enter with a lead weight or stone if there is a fistula and it is crooked, until you see that the vein has returned to its place
And if the patient cries out in pain in the groin, then you must tell them to lie down in the groin.
And if you sit on the groin the vein has already burst through the skin without you having to uncover it, or that you sit between the groin and the hip or thigh, it is known that it is penetrating; and do not work on that, for it is not in this treatment.
I say, however, that this is healthy in some homes.
And as for the treatment by which it is hoped to succeed in this case, it is that you burn a cautery over the surface of the fistula according to the size of the fistula, as it has been said before, and you insert that burn into the fistula until it reaches the groin; and repeat that two or three times until you see that all the inflamed tissue surrounding the fistula has become soft like feathers from a sparrow.
And then care for those who are wrapped in gauze around the edges until all those tissues that have become soft have been removed, and care for that medicine that generates and consolidates the flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; but if not, it is known that it is not healed in any other treatment.
And if the vein enters but does not penetrate inside the groin, where it is in the groin, between that and the vein which is visibly red from flesh or fat, and sometimes the fistula breaks the surface of the skin, then dry the wound from the start of the fistula, and you will see it dry on the vein, and be free from the fistula from the root.
And finally soften those tissues that are joined together like needles of sparrow and do not remain from any cause
However, sometimes after surgery it happens that the wound comes out between you and your operation when you tighten those tissues, then it is better to burn with fire or acute medicine, because the burn on fire adjusts well many good things: it is the closing of those tissues that have been adjusted, and the excision of the excessive humidity.
And so treat those who are wrapped in cold clothes or are wrapped in thick clothes until the limb gets warm, and then treat the wound that is inflamed and hardened.
And so medicines that contain both styptic and excretory properties; when the limb is restored, it is already healed and does not fear recurrence.</end_of_turn>
However, if the fistula has already progressed into the belly of the buttocks and is prolonged on the surface of the body, then bring the intestine to the buttocks and inquire about that.</end_of_turn>
And therefore if you are certain and between you and her is wax of fat or flesh, and it is likely to penetrate, do not perform an operation on her, but rather by means of trust and hope.</end_of_turn
The cause is to administer in her one of three ways: either that you cauterize that which we have said; or that you drain that until you have restored the concavity of the limb so that you can easily remove the pieces and perform the cure; do not proceed without first draining lest you cause the wound to burst and contaminate the patient; and indeed take care of the patient immediately when she wishes it; or that you prolong that which we have said and order that pus which you drained from the buttocks be spread over the wound, as we have said, or use another sharp instrument, and mix the cauterized parts with the fistula, and strive to restore the limb to its normal state, and if the purulent discharge does not solidify, and the fistula remains open in the buttocks, and if there is still pus in the wound, you will be more curious about the patient.</end_of_turn> And sometimes the fistula is finished in this way: when you insert the finger into the fistula, around the buttocks on the surface of the body and at the margin of the buttocks, the limb tries to perforate the extremity, that is to say as if with a needle to prepare the layers according to this method:
... and bring down in that flexible covering of flesh or around those; and put your finger into the fistula until you have restored the concavity of the limb.</end_of_turn
However, if it has penetrated the margin of the buttocks do not be afraid, for you will pull out the flesh from that wound as soon as you put your finger into the buttocks; withdraw the limb from the flesh and join the two ends together, and bind them; and leave them so for a day or two, and when the flesh has subsided from the bone, rejoin that which is between the two extremities of the flesh which were bound.</end_of_turn
And so treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.</end_of_turn>
However, if the discharge from the fistula is not penetrating, do not attempt to make it penetrate in any way, but rather leave it where it is until it has healed naturally; and indeed do so for the wound to heal.</end_of_turn
The shape of the spatum spine concerning which the fistula is split: the curvature of which is not acute and the other part is obtuse, so that you do not cause any unnecessary bleeding, as sometimes happens.</end_of_turn
Suturing of wounds in which runs safety at the incision of those.</end_of_turn
Wounds are of two kinds, that is, either those that remain between the buttocks as if of cartilage, or those that are like pieces of grass.</end_of_turn And these are small and large, and they run from these to those and are one, and not many, and are outside the buttocks and in the extremities of the limb.</end_of_turn
However, those that are outside the buttocks should be sutured according to the months of little humidity, that is to say with citrine water or a little of salt dissolved in continuous water, and according to the color of the wound.</end_of_turn
And the cure of that which comes out of the bone is that you order the patient to move and expel until the bone has scabbed over and the wounds have disappeared.</end_of_turn Then you lie down and suspend your hand over his nails or that you hold them in your nail, and in this way you will prevent them from bleeding.</end_of_turn
However, if the nails do not hold in those because of the humidity of them and their softening, then take the nails out of those and make them rough or blunt or split with thread, and withdraw them from the wounds, and sprinkle some powdered charcoal over them near the incision, so that it will adhere to those instead of cutting; or cauterize them as is decreed in the chapter on cauterization.</end_of_turn And so treat the other wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If the pain persists despite evacuation, then crush the patient's abdomen with your thumbs, and bathe it in the urine that is in the bladder, which obediently evacuates when the patient is squeezed.
Even if the swellings are outside the belly, the cause is light, for you can grasp those with your nail or grasp them with a finger, and instill them, and thus cure them with the urine that has been mentioned earlier.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish to make an incision, cover that you administer sutures according to this manner: take fine thread and pass it through a needle, and then extract the swellings from the parts above, and make that penetrate through the needle in the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the part beyond the needle, and stretch the swelling laterally; and then close the swelling with a strong structure, and then do not remove the thread and extract the needle.</end_of_turn>
Do all of this, and let one go of those and do not hold it, so that the surplus of the healing may run from that.</end_of_turn>
And place your hand over the abdomen soaked in olive oil or in cerate; and place that over the bladder and command the patient to rest.</end_of_turn And let that go into the box; and when it is necessary, care for them with ointment or another cure until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
And since they are ancient and do not work in this medicine, it is necessary that you grasp those with the thumb or with your nail until they are moist and that you host those with the thick pus that comes out, which hinders those from solidifying; and thus cure those until they are solidified.</end_of_turn
However, keep those moist in a greater proportion than the first time until the wound is healed and is scorched; and then cure those until they are healed.</end_of_turn
I say that to apply a blistering plaster is key, and do not be surprised if you notice it round according to the color of the body resembling the head of a nail, and it is useful in all parts of the body and especially in the lower parts of the legs and the feet, and because of those pains you must bind them.</end_of_turn
And then you must cover that which is in the circuit of the key, and hold it with forceps or a finger, and extirpate it from its root; and thus cure that.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize them according to what is said above in the head.</end_of_turn
But a wart is a small, rough, round elevation on the surface of the body, and moist boils are common in the most of children.</end_of_turn
And the treatment for them is to stretch and instill them, or to open them with thread or hair so that they burst.</end_of_turn And if you wish, cauterize them as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.</end_of_turn
But a termite is a small, fragrant or large fistula on the surface of the body that when it is cold finds itself in it resembling the bite of a termite, and it is useful around the body.</end>
And the treatment is to take a needle of fine awl or of needle of bolt, and be strong, and place that over the termite until it is contained by the circle of the needle of the parts of the body; and then rotate your hand over the needle until you instill what is in the circuit of the termite, and place that in the buttock of the body, and evacuate the termite from its root.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, do the same with a canula of gut or iron according to this manner:
The tip of the needle should be grasped by support, deaf (so it is not perforated), enclosed so that over the said the learning of the hand is abandoned and the revolution of that.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize the termite according to what is said above in the cauterization of ethyl in the head of the cautery.</end_of_turn
In the manner of the instruments that are administered to give comfort.</end_of_turn
Some vegetables are caused by the crystallization of silver or lead or of alum or mercury; and some vegetables are caused by those instruments which are small or great according as they are administered, forasmuch as anyone who is administering them in the care of small children is small; and of those from which the buttocks are rough or painful, their crystals are small.
The form of great and few crystals:
The head of the needle from which the bag is suspended is wide according to this manner; and that it be distinguished by the place where the bag is suspended thus as often.
And the extremity of the vein which is enclosed in the buttock, which is entromeshed in the bone, is silent (so it is not opened) like a lion, behind the skin; and on one of the sides of it are two threads, and on the other side one thread, and the breadth of the thread according to the thickness of the rays and the thicker the smaller.
And the bag in which the medicines of bladder of beast or of sheepskin are suspended, and the size of it is a palm
And it is pierced by means of four threads thus as it is revolved; and if the space which is between the threads is the thickness of a finger
And then insert into those threads firmly with thread of twelve threads, or about those; and adjust as much as possible the bag; and when it is suspended in it the bag, be straight in the head of the crystal between two distinguished ones with strong constraints, and almost crystallize with each thread: For the quality of crystallization is that which fills the bag of medicine, which is scalped according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance; and take care that it is not too cold nor too hot
And then the patient is placed recumbent on the bed of two, and the legs are elevated above it and leave it resting on something upon which they already lie or a cushion; and then apply oil or album of oil or fat of rue or mucus of fenugreek or of similar things to the extremity of the cautery with ease, and enter that into the buttock with ease, and let the minister grasp the bag and express that out through two more and these more vigorously until it is evacuated from the belly all that is in the crystal; and then extract the crystal and the patient takes their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces this to happen, keep it as much as possible; and if it sleeps like that for the whole night, it is better in the morning.
May it be that you crystallize that in the diseases of solution of the belly and the emptying of it, the hour that you repeat the cautery within it until it is healed
And if in the buttock there are emboldened or bloody spots, the hour that the crystal is silent and like a lion, of the crystals with which the children are criticized.
Care of diseases.
And I have already said in the division of the care of diseases that which was convenient for the free, and I say the same of the care of those which are with me and with medicines according to the complement
Therefore I say that diseases are varied according to the cause of the diseases and according to the place where the disease comes from
And the causes by which many diseases are caused are various as fever, or incision of space or of bone, or percussion with the hand, or with the fist, or with a needle, or similar to these causes
And the diseases that are in the parts of the body are also like those which rest on the head, or the eye, or the foot, or the belly, or the chest, or the like of these parts.
And I recommend the care of certain diseases so that it stops that reasoning and rule concerning the others diseases.
And I begin with the simple head diseases, for the memory of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter
Therefore I say that when there is a simple head disease and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is for fever or for something similar, and if it has drunk the codine alone and is a great disease and you fear that there will be a hematoma of the head, then you must cover it and apply cold to the head as soon as possible; and extract from that which is safe according to the quantity of the virtue of it if there is no other prohibitive cause of vomiting, mainly if the said sickness is caused by the disease itself is little.
And the vomiting is contrary to the part affected by the disease; and keep the patient from eating and drinking and from eating coarse food.
May it be that from the smallest cause be prohibited, however, that it should be diminished from the diet and not approach meat or drink.
And pause over the ulcer, if it happens to occur after cautery, soak it in olive oil or in wine, in which it is stipticated.</end_of_turn>
Though certain of the doctors are secure after cautery, however, pause over the ulcer, if it is recent and the air has not altered the powder which I recommend to apply sparingly.</end_of_turn>
And if the air has already altered that, pause over the wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Though if the ulcer is great or is from a sudden expansion and does not fit into the mouth of the wound, and its lips are not adjusted for pupils, however, adjust those according to what I recommend for the stitching of them.</end_of_turn
Though if the ulcer has already burst from the bone and skin, and is not a retention but a small swelling, however, prick that and apply remedies to the ulcer with medicines and restore the meat nearby in place of callous, and command the patient to abstain from eating foods that are coarse: heads and fat and the like until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if you find decay in the callous and it does not adhere to the bone, however, prick all that putrefies and evacuate it, and apply remedies to it.</end_of_turn
Though in these ulcers there may be an artery or vein from which blood flows profusely and which is not separated by medicines, however, inquire about the artery, and if you find that to be uninjured, however, prick that with a pointed cautery, or ligate that; and if necessary that you are causing to happen that which we have said do not consume, however, cauterize that until the blood has clotted.</end_of_turn
And if these ulcers are simple and small, the cause of them is slight; thus if you sprinkle over those things this powder which consolidates them as soon as the air changes them.</end_of_turn>
And the manner of the powder is this: take olive oil one part, of blood-root two parts, of vinegar non-extinct three; mix them all together and grind them, and let the ulcer be filled with it, and be bound by good constriction until it adheres, and be coagulated with the blood.</end_of_turn
And apply that tightly over the powder and read that, and do not remove that until it has dried, for that is not eradicated by the medicine until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And every day make that only that which is in your presence burns, when not in your presence oil and bloodroot.</end_of_turn
And thus make this operation in great ulcers when you consider that it should be stopped over those and that they are stretched, and only for recent ulcers that have not altered their powder.</end_of_turn
And if they have already altered that, especially when it is in summer, however, do not understand the position of that powder, thus apply remedies to those with that which we have said, thus if you pause over those wounds immediately because of digestion, or pause over those parts of barley meal with water and honey until it has disappeared; and apply the other remedies along with this until they are healed.</end_of_turn
Though if it happens in the ulcer a fracture of the bone, and it is small, however, extract that with your hand.</end_of_turn
And I say the cure of fractures of the skull in that which is venomous.</end_of_turn
Of the ulcers of the heel.
Though if the ulcer happens in the heel, however, there is no difference in medication between it and the ulcer of the head when it is simple.</end_of_turn
Though if the nerves of the heel are cut or an artery, however, if it is a nerve, it is not in its making but that it be avoided care of it with that which makes vehement stypticity, thus as with zinc and celery which is old and similar to them because it does not irritate the nerves and counteracts that.</end_of_turn And do not pause over the ulcer for any reason, for the substance of the nerves is cold and the continuation of them is in the brain, which is the most important of all members.</end_of_turn
And if that which must be cured by medicines is light, thus as when it is caused by washed vegetables with oily or non-oily, and boil that when washed with clean water and the other stones that are harmful in this manner, and keep it warm.</end_of_turn
If the plague is great, administer sutures or bind up their lips, and take care of that until it is healed.
If the plague is deep or severe at the lower part, make an incision in the area most affected.</end_of_turn>
If the artery has already been opened in the plague and blood flow is restored, separate or dry up that part, or ligate that part or cauterize that if necessary.</end_of_turn
If the vertebrae of the backbone or all of them have already been opened, and the veins of the belly have been preserved, then you adjust the lips of the codena with sutures over the belly of the patient and do not touch that; bring equal pressure to that and reduce that to its natural position, and then strengthen that which is stretched downwards, and loosen that for a few days; and take care of that which is inflamed in those in which there is stricture and excitement until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If the plague has already affected the bones in price, perforate that, and if there are fragments of bone in there, extract them all; and what is not injured, loosen that until the plague has subsided, and separate that and relieve the swelling.</end_of_turn
And if the plague is new, sprinkle powder over that which has been recommended to you.</end_of_turn> If there is a fistula in the plague, take care of that as much as the memory of it will come back to you in the head.</end_of_turn
If it is percussion of the flank or the chest, and sometimes of the belly, and the patient has a strong wind of the disease; know that the plague is deadly.</end_of_turn
And if there is no depth and the plague is new in the belly, then you stop for the first hour with powder, and do not strengthen that because it will not be retained in the depth and will return to its place and will aggravate the disease; more than that, stop it for a while, and loosen that which two veins give.
And if the tongue is not with you, then you stop in the opening of the plague for a while because of the humors; and make the patient sleep on the plague so that it runs out what is in it adjusted.</end_of_turn>
If more than three days have passed from the plague and the patient does not have spasms or trembling of the body, or stiffness of the joints or stricture of the bowels, and sometimes the other good signs of the disease, then know that the plague is saved; and now take care of that with cold compresses and the other treatment until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If the healing of the disease is excused, and the patient has already been open for a long time, then know that there is already a fistula; take care of that for the head.</end_of_turn
And if the plague is by incision of space or chest, and is simple on the surface of the foot or the thigh, then take care of that as much as the preceding suture, if it is great, or with powder, if it is small.</end_of_turn
If already in the bones there has been price, and only a little remains to be extracted, then you should crush the plague and cover it up to extract those fragments, if they are separated.</end_of_turn If they are not separated, then loosen those until the plague has subsided, for the extraction of them is alleviated.</end_of_turn
And as for the other plagues that happen in other members, the help in their treatment is the help of what we have already said.</end_of_turn
Of the belly plague.</end_of_turn>
The indisposition that happens in the belly is great, or little, or mild.</end_of_turn
A slight disruption is very difficult by another method, and even if the reduction is difficult, if you do not take care of the introversion of them to the place where they should be, they will open up and become swollen because the substance of them is difficult.</end_of_turn
Therefore the best disruption is mild, because in that one the reduction of the belly is not difficult, as it is difficult in the two preceding species.</end_of_turn
The surgeon knows that a suture of the belly is done in four ways, two sutures are common that are usually done along with sutures of the other parts of the body.
And two other sutures are specific that communicate with the other parts, however they are more specific in the suture of the belly
And I recommend that you give me any exposure and declaration concerning this
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and there is any cause of the intestine to come out due to that, and it is difficult to reduce it, then it is in two ways: either because of the smallness of the disruption as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen due to the cold of the air
Therefore when it is like that, the hour comes that you cover that with a sponge that you moisten with warm water alone, or that you grasp with water squinching, and saffron, and pepper, and cloves until the inflammation is resolved
And some doctors make it drink vinegar in which there is stiptic, which is better than plain water in resolving the inflammation
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which it is bathed high and low, which alleviates the pain of the intestines due to little cause
However if the intestines are allowed to rest in this way, then the disruption will be split by a small instrument with which incisions are made.
The first treatment is better when it is proper and does not cause excessive drying, and is not an occupation to excessively dry unnecessarily
Of the instrument, speak of its shape:
One part is sharp, and the other not sharp, and the handle is broad, not like the shape of a spatula, but rather obtuse a little
Therefore when the wound is increased and the intestine comes out, the hour comes that its reduction is according to its natural form, in its proper place, if possible over something, because it is better
However when the disruption is wide and is in the lower part of the belly, the hour comes that you must place the patient on his two buttocks, and suspend your steps above the navel; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, the hour comes that you must suspend your hand and foot above the other parts
Similarly if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, the hour comes that you must suspend your attention and your reflection for a moment so that the part in which the wound is located is higher than the other part
And in large wounds and in small wounds you must give water.
And in small wounds you must stop the water that you are preparing and give it between your greatest supports, which has the entire disruption in its hand and adjusts the lips, and immediately discover from this to that where any cause of the suture is found
This is the common suture technique: you grasp the needle or the needle handle according to the size of the wound; and you place the bite at the end of the disruption of the ring finger; and you stretch the needle once, or twice that you do not put faith in the two extremities of the codena, at the two extremities of the cipa which is left by the codena of the parts that depart, until you have pierced that part; and you have already added two extremities of the codena and two extremities of the cipa, so that there are four in total.
And stretch the faith firmly twice in the circuit of the needle, and some doctors add two veins from two parts together, and then add the two lips and the wound together by addition; and lay aside the thickness of the finger and fix another needle in that place, and tie that one to the first needle as if making a knot; and do not stop until you have completed the whole contraction of the wound.
And the fine needles between thickness and thinness, because the fine needles do not enter the flesh willingly; and the thick ones are difficult to pass through the cord, therefore it is necessary that they be passed in thinness and thickness
And do not let the needle remain in two extremities of the cord more than necessary, for so the flesh is not pierced willingly and the wound is opened before its consolidation.
And do not prolong the suture for that the wound is not prohibited from consolidation
And immediately pierce the extremities of the needles so that you do not irritate the patient’s sleep; and you will stop over the suture powder expanding from all parts, which have the extremities of the needles; and leave them in place until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
These kinds of sutures with needles in their cal manieyra are more convenient for small wounds, as they leave only one needle or two or wind around those.
The second suture should be administered as follows: administer the suture at the four extremities, the shoulder and two extremities of the abdomen, in a bundle, with a needle in which there is a firm envelopment of gut in proportion to fineness and size.
And when the needle has pierced these four extremities, reduce the needle from that middle part from which you began, so that the gut is drawn back into the wound, so that the suture is as firm as the natural suture with which it is associated.
And stop between each suture the amount of the thickness of the middle finger.
This suture saves the lives.
And in such a suture I cured a a man who was suffering from a wound in his belly which was affected by a wound to the palm of his hand which had been wounded by a nail, and it was the disruption of the greatest wound of a palm, and it was ejected from the intestines around two palms of the intestine for almost three days; and when the intestines had been reduced into the wound again, I closed the wound with this suture
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or so, and I cured that one, and it is healthy; and in this way I saw for a month, and it is reported in their statements.
And the other doctors had said that it would not be healed; and by a miracle, behold, I cured that one without any other remedy, for in that place neither any other remedy nor any medicine was to be found, but I simply remained on the wound two fingers every day and gave it continuous washing with honey water until it healed.
And I say two kinds of sutures of my own according to the narration of Paraula
And you begin with the suture of the shoulder, and enter the needle from the upper part to the lower part
And therefore when the needle pierces the shoulder and in that middle lacerate according to the rule and in length of the whole body, and leave the limb of the abdomen in which you have introduced the needle; and make the needle penetrate in the other limb from the lower part to the upper part in the other limb of the armpit
And when you have finished making that penetrate, then make that penetrate once more in that middle limb from the upper part to the lower part; and leave the limb of the abdomen that is in this lacerate, and make the needle penetrate in the other limb from the lower part to the upper part
And make that penetrate at that point where you made that penetrate with which you penetrate the intestine in the limb that is in the armpit until all that penetrates
And so begin from this middle side and go to the other side of the abdomen, and extract the needle from the shoulder which penetrated, and then reduce that one in that shoulder and close the limb of the abdomen that is on the other side of the armpit with this limb; and extract that one from the shoulder which is part of the armpit.
And do that once more and once more, and do that once more about another once until you have closed all that which is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you close with a suture of skin with which you close the skin, in such a way that you close the abdomen once from the part of the shoulder, and that you leave that other one until it is complete.
But the second kind of suture which I say is excellent for wounds of this kind is that which is called for wounds and for them it is recommended, that you close that according to the custom which all medical men close that, in such a way that you add all parts to their proper parts to them convenient for nature; and apply the limb of one of them to the other limb and the limb of the armpit to the other limb of the armpit, and that is done as I have recommended to you
Because you must leave the needle in the armpit at your own pace from the upper part, and make that penetrate to the lower part in that hole, and leave two limbs of the abdomen; and then return the needle and make that penetrate from the upper part to the lower part in two limbs of the abdomen.
And then return those loops, and make that penetrate whatever is from the lower part to the upper part in two limbs of the armpit other than those in the side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common lighter suture, and is a suture of which there is precedent remembering.
This is the speech of Gualia.
And thus I say to you, the suture of the belly is corrected with two needles, so that you enter into these with every trust, and begin with the inward puncture of the needle that is due to you, and make that penetrate into the other side following the suture of those which hold together the parts which engulf the belly.</end_of_turn>
And you know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then the suture of it is more difficult than that of the other parts of the belly.</end_of_turn
Moreover, the judgment of the plague is judged by the other plagues.</end_of_turn>
The cause is that when you perceive the recent plague in the air, it makes the air change, and reduces the swelling and boils that accompany it adequately, and thus suspends the dusty particles.</end_of_turn
And if the air has already altered the plague, then it suspends it over those parts which are with you until they become hard and cause pain, and become consolidated like this; and thus care for it as for the care of the other plagues until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if you do not have the medicines at hand, it is sufficient to suspend it for a while, for it begins to vomit bile, coat the old vomit, and change two meals a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you do not digest another medicine in great quantity when the plagues are simple.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if you fear that the plague communicates infection to the principal members, then you should cover them with warm oil of lavender or rosemary, and suspend it in the circuit of the places that are between the armpits and leave the armpits open.</end_of_turn
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in the abdominal region, which is caused by many meals, then criticize that which is black bile that is given to you, especially if it is given in excess and is found in the belly and is penetrating through the cavity.</end_of_turn
And you know that that which is of the great belly is lighter to heal than that which is in the small belly.</end_of_turn
And it is a difficult healing that the belly which is called “gegunu” does not receive the healing of the plague that fills it throughout; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and for the magnitude of it that is in them, and for the subtility of the body of that, and for its proximity to nature of nerves.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if what proceeds from the plague is the cloth, and if you have that recent, reduce it according to your rule concerning the reduction of the swelling of the belly.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if it has passed beyond that space and is already green or black, then strengthen that faith that you have over the place that is degraded by it, so that there flows out of it a flux of health, for in the cloth there are veins and arteries.</end_of_turn
And thus it is necessary to say that another ligament is another one that holds the two extremities of the thread pending the part beyond the plague that is outside, in order that on you there may be relieved the attraction of it from the body of the plague.
Remember the plagues when they happened in the belly.</end_of_turn>
When disruption occurs in the belly and is slight, it is possible that it is only left in the abdomen, in order to help so that you see that which was placed diseased in the belly of the patient because of the percussion of the hand and was the plague of the right part of the stomach, and the plague was ancient and had passed, and there was fistula, and evisceration of it and vomiting.</end>
And thus I follow the treatment of it already, even though I do not confide in the healing of it, however I will continue to subtilize it until it is healed and the place is consolidated.</end_of_turn
And thus I say that since the place is already consolidated, time to pass over the illness that you have concerning the accident of the bad in the belly; and do not do anything for that bad accident and remain in your many cares eating and drinking, and approach in bath and exercise it in your words.</end_of_turn
And I say to you that those who have experimented know that when the plague is in the belly, and is slight, it is necessary to bind it according to this manner: that you take large doses of cloves; and adjust the two lips of the plague and suspend a dose of those which are in the mouth over the two lips of the plague; therefore when you take over those and strengthen your mouth, cut off the head of it, because it adheres and is not dissolved.</end_of_turn
And immediately stop the other discharge from the first one, and do not cease until the other discharge has been equal in amount to the whole disease.
And immediately reduce the swelling of the disease; and keep those accessory heads attached to the intestine until the intestine is healed; and do not cause any damage to the patient at any time.</end_of_turn>
And it is already possible that the intestine is adhered to the surrounding fat, which is the cause of the abdominal swelling; for it is more pointed; so grasp the extremity of these fat tissues, and do not tear, and then join the extremity to the fat surrounding it, covering it with the hand, and reduce that fat into needles and put it into the belly, and reduce that which is in the disruption.</end_of_turn>
And this manner of stitching with the discharge is nothing other than by way of trust and hope.</end_of_turn>
May be if the disease is great and wide, mostly if it is in one of the small intestines, that the hour is not to do anything but to subtilize, and not to cure it completely.</end_of_turn
Care for the ulcer and fistula.</end_of_turn>
You know that all disease and swelling when it has become old and decayed is an ulcer, and it is not solidified and gets better with time and does not rupture, for in whatever member it is, it is universally called an fistula and we call that ulcer.</end_of_turn
And a fistula according to truth is a foul-smelling, hard, white ulcer which does not cause pain and which is concave just like the concave of a wound; and for this reason it is called a wound risk, that is a wound.</end_of_turn
And the ulcer of the home humida gets better; and when the humidity is strong, it is cured in a few hours.</end_of_turn And many doctors say that this humidity is moist, and little, and great, and subtle.</end_of_turn
I have already shown you all those causes, and the signs of them and their treatment with medicines in the division.</end_of_turn
And so I tell you the cure for fistula which is useful by the operation with the hand.</end_of_turn
You know that fistula can occur in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that arise from great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the pericardium, or the intestine, or the bladder, or any of the ribs, or any of the vertebrae, or any of the compound joints like the hand and foot; and of those which give proximity to the main limb and resemblance.</end_of_turn
Therefore, of all these fistulas, that which is treated in this way is of the category of difficult healing ailments, and does not admit of treatment, and requires work and ignorance.</end_of_turn
And if it is one of those fistulas whose depth does not reach these places that I have said, and you hope and trust in the treatment of them, and you wish to know of them, the hour you attempt to remove it or burn it, and if the fistula goes according to rule, inquire about it from me.</end_of_turn
May be if the fistula is tortuous, the hour you investigate that which you attempt to fix with soft lead, for the lead with the elevation of the belly is relieved and curved because of the tortuousness.</end_of_turn
And if the fistula is of great magnitude, it is not possible for you to know about it by attempting it.</end_of_turn
Therefore criticize the orifice for its orifice, for the humidity by which you criticize that one goes away from the others and comes from them.</end_of_turn
And immediately inquire thoroughly, according to what manner you are able, if here you have bone or nerve, and whether the fistula is long or short, or whether it is one to which there is more than one orifice and this is over all that you can do with the sum of your strength, with your ingenuity, with the knowledge of the disease, and the invention of the pain caused by your compression with the hand over the area, and resemblance to the symptoms and the accidental causes of the swelling.</end_of_turn
E when thou art stood over all those things that I have said, then go to the cure according to confidence: and consider whether the pain be a fistula apparent near or in the sole, distant from joint, or of nerve, or artery, or vein, or from any of the places which I have mentioned before.
Then dry the fistula according to what is said in the narration, and remain until that which is in that filtration and corrupt flesh is consumed, and that which is born in the orifice of the flesh, or in the heel and the nails, and cure that which comes out until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
May be if the fistula is of great depth, and be according to rule, then cover that which is inside as much as possible with your hand, and almost soften that of all the corrupted flesh; and almost give warm compresses enveloped in acute medicines, and introduce those into the cavity of the fistula, which you have comprehended with the iron.</end_of_turn
And do thus until any such herbs which are introduced be consumed by the acute medicine that corrodes all that is rotten in the cavity of the fistula of the corruption.</end_of_turn>
And finally restore that which is left after the healing of those which produce sound flesh until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
May be if it is not healed by this, then cauterize that according as we have recommended.</end_of_turn>
May be if the cause of the fistula is bone and you must certify that, then inquire about that and dry that according as we have recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or main limb as we have said.</end_of_turn
May be if the bone is to you discovered and is in it any corruption and blackness, then remove that which is within until the corruption is consumed throughout; and almost cure that which is in that which embraces it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if it is not healed and brings pain even as before, then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption; and then you discover about it according to the circumstances and request reason for it and the modification of it from the strong side, and finally restore that.</end_of_turn
And therefore if it is healed, well; and if not, know that that corruption is in the profound depth of the body, which has not been overcome, and then you must leave that.
And if the corruption of the bone is small, or you are able to extract it, then draw that out with fine forceps which are suitable for that.</end_of_turn
And if so many bones are moved, then carefully make the extraction of all of them, and of those do not leave any cause to your strength.</end_of_turn
May be if there is any cause of the humors, and in their incision there is no fear or error, then cut those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and discharge the bones.</end_of_turn
May be if you are not prepared to extract the bones at this time, then stop over the wound that you have caused until the wound has closed, and leave that until that which is around those bones of flesh and ligaments is expelled, and guard that the wound is not consolidated, and be constricted the section which you have cut in your operation.</end_of_turn
Well, if you fear, stop over the limb immersed in boiling soup with olive oil, or limb immersed in Egyptian unguent, or in something of those unguents which are seen to be useful, for when they will have been softened, the ligaments will be separated from the fracture, and the attraction will be alleviated.</end_of_turn
May be if it is a great bone such as the bone of the limb or the bone of the thigh or the bone of the heel or something like those, and that which is corrupted is only the surface of it, then remove that only behind until that blackness and corruption has been consumed, and finally restore the wound.</end_of_turn
May be if that which is corrupted is a great part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and that completely by stitching, and the doctor must cure that until it is consolidated.</end_of_turn
And I recommend to you that you ask a man in his bed that he should stay with you to watch over that and assist you in your operation.</end_of_turn
For a young man about the age of xxx years, who has happened to him pain in his heel, and from the parts downwards to the middle of the foot is about the size of a pea, and is matter of great swelling, and is not caused by any external cause.</end_of_turn
And then the time must be extended in that for the error of the doctors until the swelling has subsided, and I will take away the parts that move, and the care of it must be almost stopped until the limb is healed, and make in them all the incisions which all evacuate pus and the humors of the body.</end_of_turn
And thus many doctors gather around the patient for two years, and do not linger over their wisdom in this art, until I was called.
And I saw the swelling of their limbs and the discharge of pus from their wounds from great pain; and already the body of that man was stiff and yellowed
And thus I introduced the needle into one of those wounds and reached the bone.
And then I saw and examined all the wounds and found them to have penetrated all parts of the swelling
And thus I fainted and made an incision on one of those wounds until I scraped off a piece of the bone, and I stopped that corruption; and already a part of the swelling had perished within it
And thus I saw that it was necessary to amputate what was disordered and prepared from the bone exposed.<end_turn>
I declare that it was not in the bone but that corruption which I scraped out and saw; and I had already drained it.</start_turn>
Then rest the restoration of the plague with prolonged medical treatment, and it is not solidified.</start_turn
And thus I repeated the procedure and found the bone just as I had described before, and I again saw continuing corruption of the bone.</start_turn
And thus I saw that from that corruption, and I immediately performed the extirpation of the limb and the restoration of the wound, and it was not restored.</start_turn
And thus I saw the other vein again and I did not cease to prick the small veins gradually and perforate the restoration of the limb, and it was not restored until I had pricked around the palm of the limb, and I extracted that with the marrow, and then restored it with medicine, and it was consolidated and healed.</start_turn>
And it is not necessary to repeat the operation of the limb and its incision, but for the disposition of the morbid humor and for the scarcity of its tolerance and fear of death, which is in all its hours for the excess of evacuation without harmful excess.</start_turn
And thus health is for whole healing, and nothing is like the preservation of the bones; and it is good to dispose of it in the bowels of the body and restore its virtue; and it is conserved in its disposals and does not make it contrary to walk or sleep in any case.</start_turn
But if it is in the limb that the bone is prominent, the hour commands that you take ligament and strengthen that at the extremity of that prominent bone, and command someone to extend that to its furthest extent; and stop that ligament of wool thicker than the first ligament; and then put that over the bone that is left to the bone that is being closed, and extend the limb so that it stretches the bone to the parts beyond, and uncover the bone over the place where you want to close it so that the saw does not damage the bone.</start_turn
And stop fast or table the limb downwards, so that when you do that the saw does not cut the corrupted bone.</start_turn
And cover that the sawing should be done little by little over the corrupted area, so that if it is in the cavity of the bone the corruption does not appear in its appearance to the feeling, and forces the closure of the other vein.</start_turn
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, if there is a continuation of one part with the other, and the corruption is at the middle of the limb or in part of it, the hour you uncover the bone throughout; and then stop fasting, and immediately perform the sawing of the first part where the corruption is located until the sawing of the other part is completed.</start_turn
And the sawing should be done according to the location of the corruption a little, as we have said.</start_turn
And if the corruption is at the joint, prick that corrupted joint and saw the bone where it is continued from the other part.</start_turn
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, the hour is not in their ratio but is cunning.</start_turn
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the foot, it is not easy; however, cover that you inquire about the corruption in what manner appears to you, and open that, and say what you think in any way that is possible for you, and in this way either the matter will be rectified for you, or it will not make you contrary to veins or nerves.</start_turn
And you know what is incisions and what saws to make incisions on these bones are not like that according to the situation of the bones, and their preparation, and the thickness of them, and their softness and greatness and smallness, and their hardness and rarity; for it is necessary to prepare for all kinds of operations the appropriate instruments for that operation.</start_turn
You understand that the procedure you are about to perform requires great study, knowledge, and experience in this art, as well as testimony from previous patients suffering from various diseases.
And thus I say to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will employ, as well as the instruments which you will use in the procedure which you will perform at my command, which you will experience on others.</end_of_turn> Your turn. Please provide the next line of the translation.
And the other instruments are these...
And the great instruments are these...
And so on... Like the head of a star-shaped claw, and the points are like the points of a star
And it is not proper that the heads of the joints should be fractured when corrupted, or that the great opening be wide open.</end_of_turn>
The small razor is like the others...
The flat razor is like the others...
The other instrument is properly made: it is an arc with a blunt edge and a pointed tip, and the handle is held downwards.</end_of_turn> Like this...

And the tip is triangular and acute.</end_of_turn
It is made of Indian steel, and resembles the cause of all the instruments that we have mentioned of razors, and of scissors, and of saws.</end_of_turn
For the incision of the extremities and the closing of the bones.</end_of_turn
The extremities are bruised either by an intrinsic cause or an extrinsic cause, or as you have treated that corruption for the healing of those medicines, and the healing does not impede, or sometimes the corruption goes away without you having pierced anything, when in that case you must also puncture that limb in order that the disease may escape because of death or malice which is greater damage to the limb.</end_of_turn
And the sign that it is necessary to puncture that limb is that the limb becomes black before it is healed, or that the blackness approaches too close to the whiteness before the black has disappeared from that limb which you have pierced and that has preserved the rest of the body; and therefore you must order me to puncture that.</end_of_turn
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is a venomous wound such as that of a scorpion or a viper or of a bite of a worm, and the like.</end_of_turn
And if the corruption or the perforation is in the extremity of the finger, then you must pierce the finger and do not leave space for the corruption to enter the hand.</end_of_turn
Similarly, if you reach the hand, then you must pierce that from the root of the hair, and do not leave space for the corruption to enter until it has been expelled from the root of the arm.</end_of_turn
And if you are unable to do this, then you must pierce the arm into the hollow of the joint.</end_of_turn
And if it happens again, and sometimes the marrow escapes, then in that case the disease is mortal; and to administer another cause alongside the treatment is useless.</end_of_turn
Similarly, if the corruption is in the toe, then you must pierce that into one of the bones.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the heel, then you must pierce the whole foot.</end_of_turn> May it please be known that if the patient drinks within the denol, then you insert the trocar into the joint of the denol.
And if the corruption has already spread over the denol, then it is not sufficient simply to drain it off, but to leave the patient to his fate
The manner of incuding the limb or closing it is that you grasp the ligament behind which you wish to include, and grasp another ligament over the joint; and extend the minister a ligament to the parts below, and extend the minister another ligament on their; and you separate the marrow that is between two ligaments somewhat apart until the whole marrow is uncovered; and then either include or close
And that no movement be made from all parts except for the joint, so that you do not touch the marrow itself, and that the patient receives adjusted injury and applies cautery afterwards
May it please be known that if an accident of flux of urine occurs during the work, then you cauterize the area cautiously, or stop their urine until the urine is restricted; and then return to your medication until it is completed
And then bind the affected limb with a ligament or as convenient, and care for him until he is healed.
And I recommend that you send a man to a poor man in the street, this man having had this accident, which I and you recommend, which is that the acidity of urine in the street be brought to a level equal to the combustion of fire.
And that this acidic corruption first appears in the foot until it affects the whole limb.
And then that poor man prepared himself for himself more than by receiving the care, and when the limb is relieved of pain and discomfort, and when the joint is included, and the fire is healed
For a long time that poor man suffered from that same corruption in his thumb
And then I saw it, and so I pierced to perceive whether that excess rested upon the hands of the physicians, and indeed it was found to be excessive; and when I spoke of it, the disorder of the body ceased, and the excess was not repeated, but it began to subside from the thumb onwards
And he demanded to include the thumb, and I did not fear the consequence of that excess, for I knew that the virtue of the patient was about to recover it
And when he awoke from my presence, he returned to his home and told me that that poor man had prepared himself and included his whole foot, and he was healed
I have not related this narrative except to the extent that it may be of assistance concerning this disease, and to the significance which it possesses and the way in which it is to be interpreted
Take care of the spirit and the quality of the patients as with the physicians.
When an abscess occurs in fleshy parts of the limb, the space of the abscess is prolonged until collection of urine, and then it is ruptured and perforated, and the urine is drained out; the limb remains as if it were a vessel, and the surrounding skin is slightly stretched, and no further corruption is caused, neither on the bone nor on nerves or ligaments, it is simply suppuration, and it is not called fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged until the corruption precedes in any limb, then it is called fistula and does not abate.
The care of it is that you include that skin all around as if it were rotated, and more so when it is slightly stretched and is useful like wax, and comfort that it does not adhere to the limb because of its corruption
However, if you hope that the skin will adhere and that the corruption will not result in any further consequence, and if there has been swelling in the skin, then you care for that which is in the cluster
And you consider the spirit, and if it is great, and the arm that you use is of fetent odor, then you cluster that with the Egyptian medicine which is oil and vinegar and vinegar of rue, receiving oily parts, and they are adjusted in a vessel, and they are covered over the fire until the medicine is made perfect and reaches its perfection.
And then take from it what is necessary and dissolve it with water and honey; and cluster it with that spirit, and strengthen its orifice, and leave the medicine on it for the space of two hours.
And then extract it from there; and make water for as many days as it takes until the spirit is purified and the pain is relieved
Every morning, vinegar is clustered with water of ash, when not at present this medicine; take the ash of vinegar, put it on it water; then close that and cluster that with it until you believe that the time has come.
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the water of the ash, then cluster that with water and honey and add some vinegar, which has the property of changing and washing, and of the vinegar there is excess of stickiness and dryness
And when you have done that with some vinegar and you believe that the time has come, then cluster that with that water which makes the marrow rise in it.
Take some ginger and dissolve it with that olive oil and vinegar; or cluster that with some medicines and take others which have the properties that I have already written in the treatise of medicines
And if the orifice of the gut is narrow in which the catheter of the enema cannot be introduced, then gradually enlarge that with a small needle, and place on it a callow wrapped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is enlarged
Similarly, if the orifice is wide, then you will suture together its lips and leave them as much as the enema will contain
And if the orifice from which the limb hangs is elevated to the buttocks, then dry that part of the foot that is under it so that the limb may pass through without difficulty, for when the limb is contracted in the swelling of the gut the marrow will be forced out.
If it is not possible for you to dry out the gut within the environment of the bone under which you wish, then I advise you to prepare the limb with the preparation for which it is suitable according to your custom and that it be not retained by any cause of the limb.
May that which is over the gut, which you leave for an hour, so that it escapes what is contained in it from the limb. So that you may know whether that which comes out of the limb is thick or thin, or is digested or undigested.
And take into consideration the location of that gut, if in it the patient feels pain or not, and if it is swollen
And when your medicine is prolonged in this way, and you see the matter that has adhered over the opening of the gut has already adhered, or has proper adherence, then you must take it away or throw it away three days later, and when you remove the dressing, change the bandage for another and renew the ointment.
Moreover if from the gut some slight infection has spread, do not be discouraged by the adherence of the matter, for the healing of the gut is proper, for in some of those in which the generation of marrow is delayed there is a benefit, and in those in which there is benefit from the contrary.
And if from the gut a few days have passed and the limb is undigested, then know that the gut does not adhere; and if the adherence of the gut is delayed and is the cause of the prolongation, then you must adjust in the exclusion of medicines, and if the medicines are hummed in their substance and in their power, they are as dry as ginger when adjusted in excess of their addition.
And indeed if you wish to cure it, take some ginger and dissolve it in olive oil, and let it go on the gut, and mix with it vinegar in its substance, and comfort that with it, and use that.
And so it is similar in this action, when there is no limb, take ginger, honey when it is cold, and use it; or take myrrh, aloes and henbane, grind them all up and powder them over honey when it is lukewarm, and put that over the gut and strengthen that over the gut; and put that over the honey which you have warmed up until it is lukewarm, and powder over the gut and strengthen that
And various vinegar is administered with long-lasting and rational herbs (and these are celestial herbs) and barley flour and centaury, and use those simples or adjusted, grind those and crush them and powder them over the honey which I have recommended; and use that.
If it persists for a long time, and this treatment does not suffice, it is known that the corruption is in the periosteum of the bones or in the other tough parts or ligaments; then you must perform a fistular treatment, as is commonly said.
From the treatment of swelling and nails grasped and added, incision of the finger added and section of the bone.
Swelling is a swelling that does not leave the nail of the finger or toe outside the palm of the hand or sole of the foot, and it is strong in the other fingers, and when it is prolonged and its treatment is less valued, or when it is swelling of swelling caused by cautery, or is corrupted, and pus comes out from it until it consumes the root of the nail, and is strong in corrupting the whole, and is strong for preserving its corruption to the bone until it is offensive to it, and is harmful to the tip of the finger, and its color is harmful brown.
And therefore when you have what we have said in the division and do not confirm your treatment, it is necessary that you make an incision throughout the whole thickness of the nail and then cauterize the membrane nearby as much as necessary, because the cautery will not be of any use in this case.</end_of_turn>
If the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the edges of the nail are already softened, having begun to penetrate the flesh, it is necessary that you stop leaving the angle of the nail that you are cutting at the edge of the flesh, and push it back and cut that flesh easily; and place your hand over that which remains of the flesh from the corrosive medicines until it is all gone; and then treat that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If the corruption has already penetrated the bone, it is necessary that you extract the bone and remove it, because no time is safe when the bone is corrupted.</end_of_turn>
And if sometimes the corruption and the infection go down the finger, it is necessary that you make an incision in one of the joints according to the measure of its recollection, and then treat that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If the nail has percussion or infection, and there is violent pain, it is necessary that you first apply flebotomy to the patient, and then dry the nail with sharp spatulas in a transverse section, and take care that the section does not penetrate the flesh that is left under the nail, because you will cause greater pain and if there is excessive pressure of the adjusted flesh in the area; and then treat that area with that which is appropriate for the pain.</end_of_turn
That is adjusted, which is natural in the majority of households, is strong in the flesh all around, and is strong in the bones, or is strong in the nail.</end_of_turn
And these are born in the root of the joint, or are the birth of these in the bones of the fingers.</end_of_turn The one that is born in the bones of the finger does not suffer, but the one that is born in the joints is painful.</end_of_turn
And of those that are born fleshy, the section is slight, and you must cut that from the root with a spatula.</end_of_turn
And as for that which is born in the root of the joint, the treatment is difficult; and therefore take care of the amputation of it.</end_of_turn
If the one that is born in the finger must be amputated, you must at the beginning cut the flesh around it until it reaches the bone, and then hold with one of those convenient saws what you consider appropriate, and then treat that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If consolidation occurs in the fingers between their joints or by the birth of the bone that does not depart, or by consolidation of pus or by burning of fire, or by remaining, in this case you must treat that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.</end_of_turn
And also place between their bands of thread oil of rosemary so that they do not become permanently consolidated, and separate between these, or place between these a layer of soft lead until it is consolidated as you consider appropriate.</end_of_turn
And in the same way if consolidation occurs in the bones of the palm, you must dry that consolidation as you consider convenient and conform to the figure of the limb.</end>
From the beginning of vices, so are varices.</end_of_turn>
Vices are varices, and these are veins covered with large veins filled with thick yellow bile which flow in the joints of the limbs of the body, and their greatest progress is in the veins of the travelers and the laborers and the porters.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must administer purgation of the body with black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.</end_of_turn
The care of them is according to two methods: the one is that they be senseless and that the black potion be administered, and the other method is that the vein be elevated and all extracted.
The section of them is done in this manner: at the commencement of the treatment, the limb is immersed in lukewarm water until the large potion has dissolved, which is useful for the limb, and then strengthen the limb of the patient at the upper part of the thigh towards the hip joint with a bandage, and dry the vein in one place, or two, or three at a wide section, and then elevate the black potion towards the lower belly and downwards as much as possible, and withdraw it in drops until the quantity that you wish has been withdrawn and which will tolerate the virtue of the disease.
And thus do so, and command them to abstain from foods that cause black bile to be engendered.
Repeat the treatment for phlegmometery when the veins are engorged and the patient is suffering from the disease.
The elevation of them is done in this manner: you raise the limb of the patient, if there is movement in it, and then put it in water and bandage the limb with lukewarm water until it turns red and the veins become swollen; or that it be performed with exercise, if there is no water available, until the limb is blistered
And then dry the cord in the root of the vein for section in the long or at the back of it you must give it the needle, or in the buttock you must do so slowly
And then open the cord with scissors and extract the vein throughout until you see the feeling, and know that the sensation is when the tingling sensation disappears.
And so avoid it and from the cord that white that remains is the thread.
And so do so that the patient rests with the limb elevated and bandaged from the cord, and suspend that on an onion or sponge
And so do so that another incision is made nearby that incision for three fingers, and then extract the cord from under the vein until it appears
And so do so that the one that is elevated is incisions and that at the back incision you must give it the needle, and then extract that and elevate that until it is extracted for the second incision, and then extract that from the first incision that is above that
Do so until that which is most elevated is extracted from the most high part of all the incisions, until all is extracted, and then make the incision
And if you do not obey my order to extract and elevate, then insert a strong double needle through and through, and hold that and extract it, or insert the limb in such a way as to break the skin all over until it is blistered Beware that it is not injured; for if it is fractured, it is useful to your difficulty to elevate that and it is beneficial for the patient for that night.
And when all is outside, then pause over the place of the wound and cover it with greasy oil and ungreasy oil, and care for it until it is healed.
And if the disease is acute and has great pain in the parts which are to be covered, and it is not in accordance with the rule as we have said, then cover that the wound be covered over all the parts of the pain and the parts to be covered, and suspend that on an onion until that is elevated entirely.
Beware that you must not prick the vein or cause any damage to that, for that would make it difficult to elevate that; and use your prudence in that matter.
The way in which the physician must proceed with the incision from which the disease is dried up:
It is not acute as when made with needles nor is it of great extension so that it does not prick the vein; and it has great flexibility, for if it were slight, it would prick the vein because of its slightness.
Extraction of the vein of the thigh.
This vein is engendered in the limbs towards the buttocks as also in the land of the Arabs and in the arid lands of India where there is little vegetation and little rain, and in which there is no herb or shrub
And it is engendered in other parts of the body besides the limbs
The swelling of it comes from the putrefaction that comes from the leaving of the cord as well as from the venom that comes from serpents and worms and beetles and worms that are engendered between the cord and the flesh.
The sign of the susceptibility of the coming of the inflammation is that this vein that arises in the inflamed area; then the area is swollen; and then the vein begins from the area of that swelling as if it were cut from the root.
And thus when they appear from the limb, then cover that part with a plum of lead whose weight is equal to two drams. Enter into the limb to the amount of two drams, and notice that and leave the lead suspended from the limb
And as often as you see that there is a cause to the parts outside, cover with lead and notice that And if it is not prolonged, then immediately cut off a part of the limb and cover what remains; do not cut off that which is contracted inwards, for if you cut that which is contracted inwards it will cause pus to accumulate in the flesh and ulcerate badly
For it must be treated gently and slowly extracted little by little, until it is expelled from behind the limb and no remains of it is left in the body
And from this vein is extracted in a cubit which is in its length of five palms and twelve fingers, and already I have known that it has been extracted from a cubit and a half of palms
And if it is cut at the time of its treatment, then enter the ray in the thigh of the limb and perforate that along the thigh to the bone, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer putrefying of the limb for several days with medicines; and at the same time care for the cure of the abscesses.
And this vein has often been seen to be more swollen when it appears at the ankle or in the foot, and it gives rise to numerous ulcers, and is said to be the cause of many ulcers of the limb.
And therefore care for it as we have said in the division and as is said above
From a section above worms generated under the cuticle and is called bovine gout.
This disease is called in every land bovine gout because it is seen in cows and is very rare among men. It goes through all the joints and bones, and is shown by the feeling of swelling of the limb until it breaks the bone and comes out.
And the generation of it is from the putrefaction of some humors as well as from worms and serpents and worms and lice in the belly
It is feared for the malice of it, for when it enters the body and is raised to the head, it reaches the brain, and there it causes great damage, and that is what causes the swelling of the limb
And therefore when you want to cure it and extract it, it must not be done without causing the limb to walk and appear to the feeling, and when you have done that cover what is above it and what is left of it with the ligament and strong constriction, and at the same time dry it up and extract it
And if it is prolonged in the bone and you do not touch it, then immediately put a cautery on the surface of the limb until it remains still, and the greatest cause that is feared is the corruption of it as we have said above
May sometimes when it comes near the head near the brain, then strengthen over the bone with strong constriction, and at the same time dry up over it, and extract it; and cover that the disease uses as a remedy of the evacuation of bad humors, and keep away from foods that generate putrefaction
From a section above the gout.
This disease is called in our land nafir, and it is a pain that is seen in several limbs, and it is usually transferred from limb to limb
And I have already seen that as I will tell you I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I saw her arms swell up and noticed a small swelling in the funis vein of the arm, and when I had stayed for an hour, I saw that swelling disappear just as quickly as it had appeared, as if it had been gold that was moving from place to place
And then I felt pain in that limb and it became stiff in the muscle, and I stayed there for an hour
And then I went to the other limb until I reached the other arm
And I told her that I saw that she was rotating all over her body as I had seen; and I was amazed at the transformation of her limbs and the speed from limb to limb And indeed I have seen on many occasions previously that these same humors cause pain that travels from limb to limb. I have never seen anything like that in the thighs before.</end_of_turn>
And I do not think that is anything other than that the thigh was old, with dry bones and exposed veins, and that is why it feels that way.</end_of_turn>
And it is necessary that it does not appear like this backward curvature in those who are delicate and have humors full of veins hidden beneath the skin.</end_of_turn
And when you wish to cure them, and the patient feels that pain, do not think that it is your responsibility just because we have said so, but strengthen your hand over that area and leave it slightly tense until the swelling has subsided, and cauterize the area.</end_of_turn
If you do not see the thighs again, at least you have cured the swelling of the limb and expelled the wind, and sing those who are yellow and those who are black bile.</end_of_turn>
From the extraction of arrows.</end_of_turn
Arrows are diverse according to their species and the locations of the body in which they are cast, because their diversity is that some have large heads and small bodies, while others have concave or rounded heads, so they are solid; and some have three angles, and others have tongues; and still others have bars.</end_of_turn
And as for the signs of the servant when he has been hit by the arrow and has passed out, it is when the head swells with great swelling, causing vomiting, dizziness, and vertigo, swelling and vomiting of the tongue, spasm and loss of understanding, and vomiting of bile, and great swelling of the belly like a white substance resembling pus, and yellowing of the urine resembling the color of urine.</end_of_turn
And therefore if you see these signs, do not attempt to cure or extract the arrow, if not outside.</end_of_turn
More often than not when the arrow hits the heart, it is because of the left nipple, and it is fixed with great force, and is not a casual accident; and when the movement of the arrow is like that of a fist, and it is black like the plague, and if there is any coldness in the limbs, sweating, fainting, and loss of breath; and therefore you must know that death approaches immediately.</end_of_turn
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are as follows: immediate expectoration of black clots of the plague, swelling of the blood vessels that are near the belly, change in the color of the vomit, great expiration of air, and a request for air that is cold to the touch.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow hits the small intestines, the pain is caused by the lower ribs, and it is characterized by great swelling of the abdomen and great pain and difficulty breathing, and the muscles are stiff throughout.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow hits the stomach, then vomiting of the plague comes immediately with any food indigestible.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow hits the belly and remains there, there is immediate opening of the flesh, or of the membrane or intestine which is broken, and no hope remains for the cure of the extraction of the arrow.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow hits the bladder and comes out, and there is blood in the urine, and it goes away from the cause of the wound, and there is great pain over the abdomen, then you must know that it is deadly.</end_of_turn
And as for the rest of the body, such as the face, the neck, the throat, the armpits, the flanks, the chest, and the limbs, they are saved as far as possible when the arrow does not pierce any vein or artery and is not venomous.</end_of_turn
I recommend to you what I have seen about the being of these arrows, because it signifies for you the treatment of your ailment.</end_of_turn>
The cause is that in a healthy man a sharp arrow has pierced the tear duct of his eye at the root of his nose, and I have extracted that from the other side, leaving the pupil of his eye gray, and he is cured, and no inflammation has occurred in his eye since.
And I extracted another arrow from a boy who had pierced his eye with it in the gray of his eyebrow, I left the eyelid closed, and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not manage to extract it from him except for a small piece which adhered to his eyebrow, and it was a great arrow among the sharp arrows of the Turks, with gold in which there were no pupils.</end_of_turn>
And thus is the boy, and no inflammation has occurred in his eye since.</end_of_turn>
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian who had been pierced in the groin, and it was an Arabian arrow, and those are the ones for which there are pupils; and when I saw that it had plunged into two ribs, and it was already submerged in his groin; then I cautiously pulled it out with that, and thus the Christian was cured.</end_of_turn>
And I extracted another arrow from a man who had been pierced in the belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and therefore, when more than thirty days had passed and there had been no change in his condition, I saw the arrow and pulled it out, and he was cured, and no inflammation occurred to him.</end_of_turn
And I saw a man in whom an arrow had pierced both eyes, and consolidation had settled over them; and when I approached and saw that the arrow had gone into the root of the eyebrow, I extracted it.</end_of_turn>
And I saw a woman who had been pierced with an arrow in the belly, and consolidation had settled over her, and it had not changed in her conditions even in rest, and the woman had not suffered any other natural ailments.</end_of_turn
And I saw another man who had been pierced with an arrow in his face, and consolidation had settled over him, and the arrow had broken, without causing any pain, and the man remained like this.
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king who had been pierced in the middle of his nose, and it had already declined from the other side, and the entire arrow was hidden.</end_of_turn
And I was called to cure him when the arrow had entered within three days.</end_of_turn
Then I loosened the swelling of the arrow wound; then I asked her how she felt, and she did not feel anything; however, she still felt the pain of the arrow which had remained in her pupil, and therefore I hoped that that pain was due to the tip of the arrow.</end_of_turn
I applied to her the lobe in which there is an adhesive and digestive virtue, confident that the lobe would disappear because I saw the tip of the arrow there, and it would secrete about that.</end_of_turn
And no significant inflammation occurred at the place where the arrow had pierced; and I continued to apply the lobe to her for several days, and no inflammation occurred; and consolidation of the swelling remained, and the patient recovered from the pain of the extraction of the arrow within a few days, until one morning he felt the arrow no longer remained in his eye and he reported this to me.</end_of_turn
Then I stopped the acute corrosive medicinal poultice for several days until I had seen enough, and I saw that it was necessary to remove the tip of the arrow, which adhered to the bone.</end_of_turn
And I adjusted the application of the poultice for that acute medicine until it became visible to me that the tip of the arrow had appeared, and I left it in place for the space of four months.</end_of_turn>
Then when the swelling had subsided, I thought it was possible to remove the forceps from her, and I did so, and did not notice any discomfort; however, I continued to cautiously explore and manipulate it in various ways for a certain period, until one day I managed to remove it using forceps as is customary in such cases.</end_of_turn
And some doctors say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored; and I restored that and the swelling is consolidated, and the patient is cured of his ailment completely, and he has never suffered from it again.</end_of_turn
I recommend to you the quality of extracting some arrows in order to stop this rule and significance about what I have not said, because the parts of this art and the definitions of this are not comprehended by the narration or are not included in it.</end_of_turn
And the skilled artisans compare little with us; and in what is present they omit what is absent; and they find new operations and new instruments which descend from the causes of this art when they occur.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that the sagittae are not outside the limb in which they are placed, but according to two methods: either by attraction of the flesh in the place where they intersect; or on the contrary side of the other half.
And that which is placed on the flesh where it enters, or is a sagitta proceeding from the flesh, is thrown and expelled outwards
And if you do not heed this time when the cat comes, the time covers that you must leave it lying for a few days until the surrounding flesh has healed, and the attraction of it and its egress has ceased
Similarly, if it is placed in bones and you do not heed this time, the time leaves it lying for a few days and iterates that attraction and movement in each day, and it is expelled outwards
And if you do not heed this time at all for a few days, the time covers that you must perforate in the circuit of the sagitta in that bone of the whole side towards the marrow until the place is enlarged by the sagitta, and then extract that
Maybe if the sagitta is already hidden in the place of the limb, and is hidden from the feeling, the time you must inquire about that, and if you find that, the time draws that towards the pangs that are convenient for the attraction of it.
And if you cannot do this because of the constriction of the plague and the length of the period, and here neither bone nor nerve nor vein is to be found, the time you must wait until it is amplified and the sagitta can be extracted
And if you have other things to do which are urgent, the time you must deliberate the entire substance in which it is placed throughout, and think about it, if you cannot avoid the substance at the fracture of the heel and in torsion of those until you obey
And when you administer the extraction of the sagitta in any place, the time you must use with pliers of your hand in all parts until you have made that obey; and take care with your left hand that the sagitta is not broken and that it is effectively pulled out from that extraction.
And if you cannot do this at this time, the time covers that you must leave it lying for a few days until the parts that are in the circuit of it are healed, and then repeat that until the time is relieved Maybe if you are doing the contrary of the flow of health, the time you must administer what we have said of care in the head.
And keep your prudence in the initiation of veins or nerves, or strings, and administer diligently in every way possible the removal of the sagitta; and make what is easy and tranquil and tardy and firm as I have said and as you have recommended
Therefore do what contradicts the sagitta so that the illness is according to the figure according to which you must take the position of the sagitta in it, for that is more beneficial. Maybe if this is not possible for you, the time you must administer what is possible for you according to the figures
Maybe the sagittae that are expelled from the contrary side, or that already proceed from some part to the parts outside, or make the emission of the sagitta difficult by the sentiment of the part below the coccyx and sometimes that itself; then you must desist from that; and let the incision be according to the quantity in which the forceps take hold; and then pull that out, for it is beneficial to this time.
Maybe if it is retained in the bone, the time you must twist the limb according to the contrary until the sagitta presses against the bone, and expand at will, and then extract that.
Or leave that lying for a few days, and repeat that until it is healed
If the tip of the arrow is there, then you must pull it out from him.
If it is stubborn and you wish to give him an impulse, then you must enter in and grasp it, if it is deaf, twist it around so that between the curvature of his limb and the tip of the arrow you must pull it out.</end_of_turn>
If the arrow is curved, then you must pull it out from him strongly by entering into it, so that the arrow is relieved by that.</end_of_turn>
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cover all the flesh in which it is seen, if you can, and take hold of that which is convenient for you that if you pull it out it does not enter again.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow has entered the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the ribs, and is close enough to do so, then touch that part with your hand, and if it is possible to extract it without causing injury to veins or nerves, then extract it, and apply pressure to the wound if necessary, and care for that which is inside until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Form of forceps with which arrows are grasped:
Their extremities are like the beak of a sparrow, which are useful like a saw when they grasp the arrow so that it does not slip away.</end_of_turn>
And there are various types of forceps, large, small, medium and fine, according to the quantity of the greatness of the arrow and its thinness, and the width of the wound, and the constriction of the limb.</end_of_turn
like a ray so that the entrance of the limb into the curved arrow is relieved and is pulled out by that.</end_of_turn
Of flebotomy of the veins.</end_of_turn>
The veins from which it is customarily bled are usually those of the limb.</end_of_turn of which there are sixteen in the foot.</end_of_turn There are two pulse veins that are close to the ankles, which are called the great saphenous veins; two veins that are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in two holes of two nails that are called the aspicient veins; and the vein prepared in the middle of the face, and the vein that is in the extremity of the nose; and two veins that are at the collarbone; and two veins that are in the lower lip; and two veins that are in the upper lip; and — these are the veins that are called the lymphatic veins —; and there are two veins that are behind the tongue.</end_of_turn But the veins that are bled in the armpits are worth five.</end_of_turn For of those, one is the cephalic vein, which is blind; and the people call it “the head vein,” and it is deaf, and is a minor vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilica and of another branch of the cephalic; and people call that “the vein of the whole body,” and the basilica vein is stopped in the domestic lap and is called “citellar,” and the people call those vulgars “the belly vein”; and the arm vein, which is stopped over the elbow, and is that in which flebotomy is performed, and is that which appears over the elbow for the sake of its visibility; and the brachial vein, which is between the thumb and the little finger, and is in them two branches.</end_of_turn
And in the foot and the thigh there are three veins; one of which is behind the curvature of the nail of the little toe; and the second is the saphenous vein, the place of which is behind the thigh of the domestic; and the sciatic vein, the place of which is behind the thigh of the little toe; and in the thigh there are other veins similar to these.</end_of_turn
The help of the veins that are close to the ankles is to cause ancient catarrh, emigration, swelling and ulcers of the head, bad ancient ulcers.</end_of_turn
And the quality of bleeding these is as you will recommend to me: that it should be rapid from the head of the patient, and that it should be frequent from the head of the patient in the occipital region in the place where both veins are close together and wide and in good friction; to strengthen the patient should be held by the collarbone with a bandage that appears over the two holes and their places are close to the ankles in two depressed places of the head; and you should grasp that with your thumb, and if you sit on that thumb, here is the sign that it is necessary to pull out the veins.</end_of_turn
Apop tu pren la lancea cutellar, e es aquela que es inscident, e apop tu intromet aquel dejos la vena en la codena entro que·l fleubotomi vengua al os. When you have taken the lancet, and it is the one that is incidental, then elevate your hand with the vein and the cord to the area below and puncture the vein at the point of incidence.</end_of_turn> And let the length of the incision be the quantity of two fingers adjusted or around that; and do it as well as you wish.</end_of_turn>
And then strengthen the hand with powder and leave that which is within until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And thus has been done in the beginning of this treatment the incision of these and their cauterization.</end_of_turn
More of the two veins or arteries that are among the temperals helps with phlebitis is the ancient emigration, which is bad and congestion of the blood and excessive swelling of the limbs.</end_of_turn
And the quality of phlebotomy of these is as I recommend to you: constrict the patient's body and let the two veins appear at the feeling of appearance and let it be shown that they are leaving by letting go of the hand that was holding them; and when you see that they are going well, then you will know.</end_of_turn
And elevate the cord above the vein to the area below as I have said previously, and make the phlebotomy incision beyond, and elevate the vein in its place; and puncture it as you did with the two veins before; and do it according to the amount of your need.</end_of_turn
And remove the dressing from the patient, and rest your hand over the vein for an hour, and then place your hand over that dressing and powder and strengthen that below with strong constriction, and leave that which is within until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And thus is completed the reminder of these, and of those the incision, and the attraction in the beginning of the treatment.</end_of_turn
And thus the benefit of phlebotomy of the facial vein is near the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein to the ancient diseases of the face and to emigration and dropsy and ulcerous fevers.</end_of_turn
And the quality of phlebotomy of these is as I recommend to you; so that the patient grasps their body with a bandage until the vein appears; and take with you the instrument which is called fossori of which this is the form.</end_of_turn
Pause the puncture immediately which is at the head of the fossori on that vein and puncture it on the side or in any other way as you like; and let the blood run out according to the amount you wish; and then remove the perforation of the patient and strengthen that which is within until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Many doctors open the vein widely with phlebotomy, but it does not follow that all phlebotomies are of acute extremity as well as the others; because sometimes the phlebotomy is of remote extremity, and phlebotomize that according to the transversion, for which the bone is properly and strongly fixed in it when it is slight.</end_of_turn
More the benefit of the two veins that are among the tears of two hands for scabbing of the hands for dropsy and swelling in the limbs, and to the diseases of the face.</end_of_turn
And the quality of phlebotomy is that the patient grasps their body with a bandage, and phlebotomize those, and you remain standing over their head.</end_of_turn
And the phlebotomy is done according to the traverse from a little distance from the phlebotomy to a little distance, for in the place there is no bone; and if the phlebotomy is slight, the limb is strongly fractured.</end_of_turn
And do the bleeding run out as much as you wish, and pause over those clots, and strengthen those for a night, and then remove those.</end_of_turn
More the phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is connected to acute fever and to violent sweat, and to the diseases of the face, emigration, and dropsy that happen in the face, and more especially when it is ancient.</end_of_turn
And the quality of phlebotomy of these is that the patient grasps their body and take hold of their nose with their left hand, and take the phlebotomy slightly long and leave that in the middle of the head of the nose according to the rule, for the vein does not appear here, and the blood begins to flow immediately.</end_of_turn
Beware that you finish your hand slowly with the phlebotomy little by little and let the blood run out according to your need; and leave that for a night, for that which is restored spontaneously.</end_of_turn
The joint pain caused by cold humors infiltrates every part of the body, and when it occurs in the feet, doctors customarily call it gout.
The quality of the flebotomy of those is that the patient should expel some of the thick mucus from their chest; and let the artist sit above the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a chair.
And then perform the flebotomy of the vein slowly and gradually by making small incisions; and extract blood according to the appropriate measure or as often as necessary; and do so in a similar way to the other vein
And then remove the ligature and tighten the two veins slightly so that the patient does not suffer any discomfort, and leave inside until the wound has healed.
The application of flebotomy to the veins will cause comfort to small boils and abscesses of the mouth and corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and to bad ulcers which are on the nose and in the throat.
The quality of the flebotomy of those is that it will cause the patient to vomit before you, strengthen the belly with a belt, and turn the patient's lips up and support two veins of which one is from the right lip and the other from the left; and the sign of the two is for the blackening of either of them, and more so when in the circuit of those two veins there are many small black veins; and then prick each one for the pricking of each.
If you are in doubt, leave it, and do not know which of them is the best, then you will understand at the time of incision of the greater of those, and by the pus that manifests itself
And do the same with the two veins that are in the lips above
More than two veins that are in the lip below, the application of flebotomy to the cephalic vein is of great use for pharyngitis, to the disease of the uvula, and to diseases of the mouth
The quality of flebotomizing those is that it follows the patient between their teeth before it gives up, and raises the tongue, and leave the tongue from the one side of the vein and from the other side of the vein, and the color of each one is declining towards blackness
And then prick each one; and take care that you do not burn your hand in flebotomizing those, for those are arteries
And the veins which are flebotomized in the groin are those which customarily run in all homes, and the flebotomy of them is useful in two ways, or by making the incision at the root of the vein or by making the incision at the ankle with a needle or by cautery, and call if needed, and this is the way to do it:
Both the needles of the same kind as these as well as sometimes, convene you to open the veins that contain apparent large blood clots, and to those which contain thick blood clots.
This flebotomy is of less breadth and of little depth, and convenies to flebotomy of subtle veins which contain thick blood clots of the citrine kind
The application of flebotomy to the basilica vein which is one of the three veins: which extracts the blood from the diseases which are left in the gut and the belly, and from what is left of the feet and the belly.
And it is necessary for the flebotomist, when he flebotomizes that one, that he should guard well that and be over-calm in that, because if he slips and makes a puncture of the vein, he will injure the artery and blood will flow, so that he must quickly stop by cutting as if necessary.
And if the basilica does not appear to be apparent, the hour you must leave that one and move to the other, or that you seek any branch nearby; or that you flebotomize in place of it the furthest from the arm, which is also apparent; and cut that one with the flebotomy immediately as we have said.
May it be that if you wish to perform a flebotomy of the limb, then cover beforehand the stricture of the arm that touches the area until you reach the area of the pulse; and then secure over it with a bandage; and ligate the arm and cut the vein with a curved incision as we have said; and keep that the percussion be at some distance from the area of the artery.
And when you see, when you stretch the ligament, swelling in the area that you have marked with a bandage, then know that that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that.</end_of_turn>
And if sometimes during the flebotomy, like urine from a child, there appears yellow fluid, know that this is the blood of the artery; and therefore keep that the hand is tightly bound over that for a long space; and another servant should hold the hand bound, and if it is cut, know that the veins have been cut; then tighten the hand and let go of that.</end_of_turn>
And take care of the patient from the discharge of the wound, and over-treat it and do not allow anyone to touch it for several days until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Or if the blood is not cut, and sometimes when you must not have medical attendance at this time, know that you must puncture the artery if you see it; for the limb will be contracted, and the blood will be cut; or that you take a short forceps, and grasp that, and take hold of the thumb and tighten that over the area of the vein with the stricture descending from the ligament and from the particles within until tomorrow.</end_of_turn
Or if the blood is cut, that is good; but if not, know that you must care for that from which the blood has drained before remembering the place of the clots that have bled out the blood.</end_of_turn>
The excision of the blood of the limb is difficult in many situations for the small size of the wound and the possibility of the ligament of the arm.</end_of_turn>
And from the jugular vein the flebotomy is useful in that it extracts the blood from the upper part of the head and from the lower part of the body; for it is composed of branches of the basilica and branches of the cephalic, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And cover the flebotomist if there is any over-treatment in the flebotomy of the limb, for there is a nerve; and when you puncture the flebotomy and find the nerve, you will cause him to lose consciousness, and it will be difficult for him to recover, and often will not recover at all; and this nerve is often hidden from view among many people and is subtle and not shown; know that you must stop the flebotomy at the point where you saw the bleeding, and avoid the nerve with your strength.</end_of_turn
And if the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein in its length.</end_of_turn
The advantage of the flebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it extracts the blood from the head and relieves the pains of the calves.</end_of_turn
And take care of this in the same way, if you want the flebotomy to puncture with olive oil or with myrtle; for this is the best way of all, for it does not touch the artery or the nerve.</end_of_turn
And indeed it is often the case that it is postponed in many people, when it is not performed in the first percussion, may it not be noticed in that postponement.</end>
The first is that you must know that the flebotomy is not administered except in the conservation of health and in hope of its success and caution against the occurrence of diseases, and that it is useful to perform the flebotomy in one of the veins that are in the fold, that is: cephalic, femoral and basilica; and that it is useful to perform the flebotomy at the beginning of spring, after breakfast in the spring and autumn, and in winter almost at the time of seed increase.</end
And it is useful to perform the flebotomy and the third day or at the first hour after three hours have passed.</end
When the flebotomy is administered, it must not cause discomfort or necessity at night or during the day, at any hour or at any time.</end>
And it must not be performed before thirteen years, and a woman must not be flebotomized until after four months have passed, and the old ones must not be flebotomized who have already passed sixty years.</end
And if someone wishes to be bled for any reason, cover that you modify the bowels beforehand with a sponge in the bladder, if there is retained blood in those, so that the veins do not draw out the surplus in the bladder bleeding, which is pushed, and that it does not harm the principal members.
Do not let the patients be bled excessively at once, neither for sacred purposes nor for drunkenness, nor because of any illness or fever, until such time as that which remains of them is remade that which has gone out, neither illness of hydrophobia, and more than that, bleeding is not to be feared except with colic passion and vomiting, and except for the contents of the belly, and excessive drinking of wine or eating of eggs, and doing of many things which dissolve virtue, or which are corporeal or animal in nature.</end_of_turn>
And consider carefully the composition of humors before giving food and drink, and medicines if it is possible to them.</end_of_turn>
And enter into rest if any cause does not prohibit, or be exercised by any exercise so that the patient be subtitled.</end_of_turn
And stop the bleeding in the feet of the day, so that it is three o’clock, as we have said.</end_of_turn>
And take care that the foot of that be preserved on that day from all accidental animals, as well as from anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, as from work and excessive drinking and other things that may be hurtful to them.</end_of_turn
And in his seat make present the causes by which it is customary for men to be aromatic and odoriferous and to have balms and similarities to those according to the quantity of possibility.</end_of_turn
And follow the bleeder on a cushion which is more firm than the cushion of that which must be bled.</end_of_turn
And draw out the arm, and cool that with your hand the bleeder gives two or three compressions; and strengthen the ligament with a bandage and cover that with two compressions.</end_of_turn
And be the tempering strict, for the stricture when not equal, or the stricture is too great, the hour prohibits the flow of blood; or is too soft, and the hour prohibits the body of the patient fainting.</end_of_turn
And take the tempering, so that that which must be bled cools his hands between them before the veins swell, and is declared by the feeling.</end_of_turn
And the bleeder take a little oil against himself properly; and then suspend the hand of the indicator over that vein, leaving the place of the wound open, for the vein escapes a little, and the percussion is settled because the vein is the one that they found thus as a string that flees beyond the bleeding, and that is filled with blood, and when the bleeding stops over that one is contracted beyond the bleeding, and the bleeder is discerned; and the bleeding does not open the vein, and if it does open, that one is stretched.</end_of_turn
Therefore, because the bleeder is finished and is requested in all these matters.</end>
And in case the vein be burst in a vein, the hour is not good; and if so, repeat what you have done before, leaving that place a little, or over it with fasting, if that place is not clotted.
And if that place is clotted, or the illness is spread, the hour you leave it for a day or two, and do not strengthen the bandage, because it will cause fresh clotting, nor enter into rest.</end_of_turn>
And repeat the bleeding if necessary.</end_of_turn>
And if the wound is small and the blood flows silently, and you fear that it will not be enough to save the quantity you wish, the hour you repeat the bleeding in that place according to custom and adjust a little in the wound, and do fasting until that place is clotted, because that place is clotted in many people because of little wound.</end_of_turn
More than once that has clotted, the hour does not repeat it, because it is not useful for any cause; and suspend over that any part of the wound of oil, because it relieves the body of the patient.</end_of_turn It is better in this place with oil than with other oils.</end_of_turn>
Similarly, administer oil to the wound in all bleeding from which the veins beyond the prohibition of the body of the patient are bled, and make it thick and viscous when it is stopped from one of those to that place, because the blood is subtile and is turned when it is great.</end_of_turn
If in the place of the flebotomy there is generated great swelling, which causes veins to become congested, especially those which have not bled, or in the opening of the small vein, then withdraw your finger, and place over the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, a little scraped off, and press that for an hour, until the swelling is dissolved.
And cover that with the warmth of the blood of that vein along with another vein or another
And if you stay in that place for several days, any blackening or greening will not matter; if you wish, pause over any cause of pain or dizziness, or any cause of hiccup or of mental distress or of swelling or something like that
Veins become congested due to swelling caused by flebotomy from the basilica
Therefore place your hand over that, and if you find excessive pain, put your compression over that; for when that swelling is great it is bad and harmful; and then keep that you pause over any cause of that which we have said, because a strong flow of blood comes from the great artery.
And apply a compress wet in which there is a styptic, so that the place is hardened, and then care for that as for the other treatment until it is healed
And cover that you extract from the blood of all men according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the color of the veins remaining over the blood according to how it appears
For if the blood is black, then you must leave it to rest until it is cured; in the same way if it is thick, you must leave it to rest until it is thinned; and in the same way if it is acute, until the pain is gone
And cover that whoever is full and strong and has need of extracting blood in a vein, that the flebotomy of the vein should be greater and the flebotomy should be large
And in that one who is pale, do the opposite of that, and cover that you extract it in small doses, and that the patient should be steady
The best thing in the flebotomy of the vein is that it should be a transverse section, not a puncture<end_turn>
This method of flebotomy is saved from the flow of blood and from the lesion of nerves, and is more pleasant and more safe than the flebotomy according to breadth and length<end_turn>
And to which it is accustomed to succeed without fainting you must do the flebotomy, and cover that you care for that before the flebotomy with a little piece of bread infused in wine in place of a thousand grains or of simple oximel scraped off; and extract a little blood from the blood in three doses or four<end_turn><end_turn>
And if there is a chill of complexion, then before doing the flebotomy give an infusion of wine with marjoram or with honey flavored with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and the like, or with an aromatic and scented infusion.
And if fainting occurs due to this, that is a cause of the patient not having enough blood, then cover that you must precede with drinking water from the marrow and a fragrant infusion; and use aromatic herbs and let the patient rest on that side.
And use the other causes which we have said in the division of fainting due to evacuation.
And whoever wants to prevent fainting and dissolve the blood according to the dose, cover that for which the flebotomy is for moving the evacuation, and the virtue of that one is cold, which evacuates the blood little by little, as is according to the quantity of the virtue in the continuous days
May whoever wants to prevent fainting and keep the blood according to the veins, and the patient is strong, then do that immediately for seven or eight hours from the first flebotomy<end_turn>
May whoever wants to take the blood from the body contrary to the departure to which it declines, cover that it should be done on the second or third day.
May that body in which there is no blood already scraped and is acute and causes fever, cover that you take a little of the blood in one dose and take a large quantity of it and amplify the opening until fainting does not occur, for in that case you have preserved all the conditions of flebotomy; and place your hand over the pulse of the patient so that you do not cause death instead of fainting, for much swelling occurs when the flebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And do not cover when you want to remove the arm and evacuate the blood according to the dose, when already the orifice of the vein is closed and it is difficult to have the blood, because you must prefer that over that fierce urgency and extend your fingers widely, for that is too bad
The patient has a swelling that is painful to the touch; or the swelling remains with the acute pain of the phlegm, which is a coagulation of blood in the orifice of the vein; or it is caused by the inflammation of the marrow of the bone, or of the fatty substance of the marrow.
If the vein is clotted, then do not touch it until the clot has settled.
And if it is necessary to evacuate the blood according to the circumstances, and this is not excusable, then do so over that area or on the other arm in another vein
The swollen vein called "funis brachi" is phlegmatized in the place of fat or bone, when not found or hidden, which is composed of those things.</start_of_turn>
The quality of the phlebitis of these veins is that the patient places their hand in cold water until the pain disappears and the vein becomes clearly visible.</start_of_turn
Then strengthen the point over that which there is a ligament or stricture; and do not phlebotomize horizontally or longitudinally, but rather in a small circle.</start_of_turn
And let the opening be wide and your phlebotomy be over the joint of the hand a little.</start_of_turn
And if the flow of the blood is prohibited, then repeat the hand in cold water and let the blood flow in the water until you have achieved your purpose.</start_of_turn
Even in the summer days, you are excused from the repetition of hand in cold water, and the month is stopped for the preservation of the blood in cold water in winter.</start_of_turn
The phlebotomy of this vein is more beneficial than all the others, for it has no pulsating vein or nerves.</start_of_turn
The phlebotomy of the cubital vein is related to the diseases of the fetlock.</start_of_turn
The quality of the phlebotomy of these veins is that you strengthen the hand over the ligament or over the hand, for since you have placed it in cold water, the vein is swollen and is immediately visible; and do phlebotomy in a circle; if you do not do so, you will not achieve anything.</start_of_turn
Beware that you do not touch your hand with phlebotomy, for you leave them without nails of flesh.</start_of_turn
And repeat the hand in cold water and let the blood run in that way, for if you do not repeat it in cold water, the blood will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and it is prohibited to flow.</start_of_turn
When the blood is extracted according to the quantity of need, then you pause over the vein with oil and salt, so that it is not solidified too much; and at the same time cover that you do not touch anything nearby.</start_of_turn
Moreover, the help of the phlebotomy of the left hand is that it is related to the diseases of the heel.</start_of_turn
And do the same in the phlebotomy of these veins as you did in the other.</start_of_turn
The help of the median vein in phlebotomy is for diseases that are in the lower parts of the body, such as diseases of the knee, and for retention of menstrual blood, and for the diseases of the tonsils and ulcers of abscesses and ancient wounds.</start_of_turn
The quality of the phlebotomy of these veins is that the patient puts their whole foot in cold water and makes a friction over that area until the veins become visible; and they bind over the ankle joint with a bandage; and in the area of the vein they feel a pulsating that must be pointed out, and from that there branch out in the face of the foot many nerves.</start_of_turn
Therefore, phlebotomize as widely as possible or leave the bandage over the ankle where it has been placed to avoid adhesion.</start_of_turn
If you phlebotomize on the face of the foot, then you must take care of the nerves that are left over that area of the face of the foot, and pause your phlebotomy over that which you phlebotomize so as not to injure it.</start_of_turn
Be careful in your phlebotomy.</start_of_turn
Even if blood flow is prohibited, repeat the foot in cold water and let the blood run in that way until it is evacuated.</start_of_turn
If the phlegmatic patient flees in the first watch, then repeat the phlebotomy a little later, when the limb is relaxed; and do not fear the malice of the patient, more than that you take care of the nerves just as we have said.
Similarly do as with the other foot, exactly as before.
And concerning the sciatic nerve, as we have said, its root is to be left in the pelvic cavity
The benefit of phlebotomy is that it is useful for an aching ankle when it is for healing the burn.
The quality of phlebotomy is that the patient's pain ceases, and he is relaxed and his belly is relaxed from the flank of the thigh to below the four fingers up to a long strip that does not appear except for this.
And therefore, when it appears, repeat the phlebotomy whenever possible and according to the condition, and it is better; or perform it by incision or by excision, because the root of the limb is relaxed
It is in many homes not so well known; and if you find it like that and it does not appear to the feeling of the whole, repeat the phlebotomy of some part of the limb, that is which appears in the two toes instead of the thumb and the index finger
Take care of the nerves, and run the healing in the quantity you wish
Then remove the ligature and place your hand over the site of the phlebotomy to strengthen the limb, because it is immediately healed.
From the wind and from the qualities of these things
The winds are of barley, or of wheat, or of ivy
And the wind is useful in two ways: one is by scarification and extraction of blood, and the other is by the wind itself
And this wind that is of scarification is done in two ways, that is by fire or by friction
And to the winds that are administered by scarification and extraction of blood there are fourteen parts of the body, of which one in which the winds are stopped is the ankle; and the fifth part from the knee downwards; and the winds from the chin downwards go beyond the mouth; and the winds from two spatulas; and the winds of alohost, which is at the end of the thigh; and the winds of two flames; and the winds of two braziers; and the winds of two cavities; and the winds of two cushions
The wind does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and by this it does not take away the virtue of these things, just as in the case of phlebotomy; neither does it suffice that the wind should be done by fire or friction in any ailment that is useful for the evacuation of everything from the body
However, if necessary, we can cause a wound for an ailment or for a continuation, we will administer it at the beginning and at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month and at any other time as needed
And therefore, when in any case of these, and properly if it is in the third or half of the month, it is commanded that the wind should be done more than at any other time of the day or two or three hours
And the benefit of the wind from the neck is that when it confers gravity to the head and that which is effaced from the heels; however, it does not suffice that it should be a close evacuation of everything from the body
And this wind is in the place of the cephalic phlebotomy
It is not lawful to use it for those who are of complete madness, or in which there is congestion, because it gives great harm to that.
And for this reason it does not suffice that it should be used for the old people, and in the heads of those who have diseases of the head
May it be known to him who remains silent on this matter that the cause of the pain is oblivion; and for this reason I command the attendant to remove his hand a little from the patient's side, fearing the generation of oblivion.
The scent of ale is more effective than the lancing of the veins of the belly and the bladder: and for this reason I assign it to the asthma, and to the constriction of bile and the cutting of the pain of bile, and to coughing, and to distension
And I order that the scent of ale be applied sparingly, because if it is left behind, it generates weakness in the body and the stomach
The scent of chamomile relieves headaches and ophthalmia, diarrhea, anxiety, and toothache; and it is more effective than the lancing of the veins of the veins of the marrow
And I command the attendant that he does not touch his hand too much with the knife so as not to bruise the artery and cause the flow of blood to stop
The scent of mint relieves hiccups in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and resembles the taste of the diseases that are in the mouth, and it is more effective than the lancing of the veins of the liver that are in the armpits
And the scent which is useful over the armpits relieves the headache, which is useful for replacing heat.
And the scent of the armpits of the armpits which comes from the bones relieves the lancing of three veins, that is of the bladder, belly and head, because those that are behind bring blood to all those veins which are more numerous than those that go out from them, and those smaller veins which go out of the others enter into those three veins.
I command the attendant not to proceed too much with the knife, because the flesh is stripped of skin, and leaves the nerves and blood vessels exposed.
This is a scent that is applied over the buttocks and relieves haemorrhoids and ulcers behind the legs.<end_turn>
And I order the attendant that it should be a strong scent, and that it should be of cinnamon, because it digests strongly of fat; and strong should be taken subtle winds and should be applied with a knife.
The scent of the camomile that is taken in small quantities is useful for all the body, and relieves the ancient pains of the kidneys and the liver, and the bladder; and it provokes menstruation, and relieves vomiting and diarrhea; and it is more effective than the lancing of two veins, and it stops swelling and bruising, and two cavities
However they do not benefit all the body and make it swell in many people<end_turn>
And the scent that stops swelling is useful alongside the scent of two veins of the buttocks
The quality of the position of the scent is that it stops the initial vomiting and promotes the vomiting of a tempered amount, and does not prolong the position of the scent, but rather pauses them leisurely, and keeps them moderately, and that the humors go to the place they should go spontaneously without being delayed And do not cease until you see that the place already recovers and swells and that the rigor of the blood appears
And when you have finished the lancing and repeated the vomiting a few times, and consider the condition of the body.
For the weak person who has soft flesh and rare veins, I command that you give a little scarification and do not do it again, because the place is not to be ulcerated
I command the attendant to widen the scarification and make a little hole, and to breathe slowly.
And if there is toughness in the blood, I command that you make two incisions, because in the first incision the delicate vein of the blood is opened up and the blood is released from it. And in the second one the acquisition of the extraction of the thick blood is obtained
And if the blood is not thick, I command that you make a third incision so that you can achieve the marrow
Finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a little, suffice with a single incision.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we make several incisions; and if we know that the blood is thick, I command that you make a wide incision.
The limit of the incision is only the depth of the skin.
If the thumb is large, hard, dark, and swollen, that the veins become smoother, open and resolving; if in summer, thus as olive of aloes or olive of violets, or olive of meadowsweet, or olive of poppy seed; if in winter, then olive of mastic or olive of lily, or olive of chamomile, or saffron.
If the swelling is great, fiery, then let olive oil be taken either amaranth or balsamite, or aloes or pennyroyal, and the like.</end_of_turn>
But if the wind is of great power of tough hair, then let it be forbidden to take oil, and let the veins of the wind be bathed with water of almonds or hot water of the sun, or water of poppy seed, or water of chamomile, or the like.</end_of_turn>
And if the patient has moisture of humiture, wash their veins with vinegar or water of myrtle, mastic and alike.</end_of_turn>
And if the swelling is great, wash their veins with strong vinegar or water of elderberry, which is greater, or of chamomile or of camomile, and the like.</end_of_turn
And let the wind be kept away from bathing; having bated it must be administered almost immediately after the bath for an hour or two, and let it rest near the wind.</end_of_turn>
What is it that makes it useful to restore the veins from a phlebotomy before the venostasis?
Let us consider at the beginning: if the wind or the one who is to perform the phlebotomy is bilious and winds over them sick and inflamed, let it be foreseen that cold causes will be excluded, thus as vinegar and lettuce, and saffron, and juniper berries, and alike.</end_of_turn
And omit their food thus as poultry, and fatty meats, and foods with vinegar, and the like.</end_of_turn
And if the complexion is fiery, let it be foreseen to abstain from drinking strong drinks or eating almonds and fennel, and garlic; and let them be advised to drink little and eat sparingly, and omit poultry and meat and fish and peas and onions.</end>
And let the drink be greater than the food in the day of wind and phlebotomy.</end_of_turn>
And let the patient be given in some hours after the meal some strong drinks like barley barley flour or medicine of must or honey before or after the wind or phlebotomy or at the same time, so that the principal members be comforted and the sickness be mitigated; and let them not take any enemas.</end_of_turn
But the winds that we must not sacrifice are the winds that stop their fetor on the heel and the ankle, and on the navel, in the groin, and the armpit, because these members must not suffer sacrifice upon them.</end_of_turn
And it is not desired for these except for the attraction of the sickness of a limb, thus as the wind is stopped over the breast in the disease of flux of blood of the breast; and they use this for that the wind is dispersed from the limb thus as over the belly and the navel; for that scarcity strengthens the limb and makes it scaly and removes the pain that resolves the wind.</end_of_turn
And already is it stopped on the hiccups when they happen in their application or support, for by the power of strong attraction it makes the hiccups go away and expels the phlegm from its place.</end_of_turn
And in the same way when it is stopped on the heel and the ankle it removes the wind from those enclosed.</end_of_turn
These winds are administered cold with vinegar only; and some are administered with fire.
And some are administered full of hot water in the diseases of the breast.</end_of_turn>
And this is for that the wind should be full and greater, so is hot water alone or hot water in which are boiled herbs that are convenient.</end_of_turn
Form of wind administered with fire: the breadth of the orifice of two fingers, as we have formed it; and the quantity of the preparation is the amount of a palm; and it is placed on the side of the limb, in the place where it is in the circuit, the amount of the limb, the neck is small according to the quantity that enters it with a needle.</end_of_turn

O, son, understand that the learned physicians, the vulgar people and those who at some time neglect the works of the Ancients or do not read their letters.
Therefore, in our land, this kind of madness among the learned is a private matter; and I have never forgotten it at any time; for I have not abandoned it until now, except for the length of reading the works of the Ancients and studying to understand them, from which I have extracted this science.</end_of_turn>
And I direct you to experiments and studies throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter all that concerns my science and the experiments that I have made on the subject; for I have abridged what is proper to you others and delivered it from the burden of long dissertations; I have opened it in the end for brevity; and I have shown in the end how I have formed various methods for treating those ailments that are administered in this way, as it is mentioned in addition to the declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.</end_of_turn>
Chapter First.</end_of_turn>
Summary and collection from this fracture of bones, from which the previous preface is necessary, before we begin the recollection of fractured limbs and various parts of each.</end_of_turn Therefore, let us speak in the prologue of this chapter about the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters that follow are intended to bring to light the artifices and to settle the truth of those things; so that you and those who wish to learn this noble art may know or learn it from you.</end_of_turn
Therefore, I say that when an accident of fracture or dislocation or twist or any similar thing happens, the hour immediately covers that you should begin with cold compresses or apply an aleatory, or whatever helps, if it does not impede any cause, as befits prudence, or if it is the heat that has caused the accident, or if the person is young and robust, or if it is cold weather.
And let food be moderate in salads of fresh herbs and boiled meats of calves and crabs; and forbid fatty meats and feed that is full of fat, and all food that fills the veins of the stomach, except that you follow the rule of caut dressing, and do not fear the effusion of matter from the limb.</end_of_turn
Then return the patient to their first position as soon as possible.</end_of_turn>
And when the broken bone begins to be restored, the hour covers that the patient should not be given nourishing foods of great viscosity, such as porridge made with flour and water, broth, eggs, cheese, fish, beef, fat, and barley, and in this regimen there is a coagulation of the fracture that is more useful and more gentle.</end_of_turn
Therefore, you know that bones that are fractured in the first degree and in decrepitude cannot be continued to be fractured and consolidated according to their nature because of the drying up of the limbs.</end_of_turn
However, nature must adjust and remember that the fractured bone of any part whatever, is of such great size that it adheres and strengthens itself as soon as it is bound together, until it comes to the end of movement and rest, just as with fire at the beginning, except that no cause hinders that.</end_of_turn
Therefore, in this case it is necessary to stop the patient's food, food in which there is gravity and viscosity and greatness, as we have said.</end_of_turn
Therefore, you know that the species of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limb, for the fracture of the thigh bone is different from the fracture of the head bone; and the fracture of the foot bone is different from the fracture of the forearm; and so on with all the other limbs.</end_of_turn
And I remember all kinds of fracture, explained in a distinct chapter from the others.</end_of_turn
There are many different fractures within each category.</end_of_turn And the species of fracture within each category are diverse; for example, a fractured bone in its star may be fractured in a different way from one that occurs in its marrow; some fractures are simple, while others are compound, proceeding from the break of the bone itself and not from the surrounding tissue, just as it is in writing when prepared to write, and it is a fractured bone with a wound and disruption in the head, and a fractured fissure of the bone.</end_of_turn
And in every case it is an evil or torment proper in restoring them according as will be remembered from their distinctness in the various places.
Sign of fracture of the bone. And for this is known as fracture of the bone: it is twisting of the limb, and from that protrusion and appearance of the limb to the sensation, and so from that when it is compressed with your hand
And therefore when there is no apparent twisting of the limb or even if it is not suspected, you must touch the bone gently when you touch it so that the patient does not feel great pain, for here there is no fracture
There is also the possibility of slight twisting or small fracture, whereupon you must not press on it with your hand and compress it; there must be a pause in relation to the medicines of which you remember at that moment; and immediately for stricture of the marrow
And you must know that when the limb is bent and is not fractured into two or other parts that do not affect it in its stability, as for example the whole part of its substance, the hour is that you begin to rectify it immediately after the cause has ceased.
And if it recurs after the cause has ceased, leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides; and then support it in any way that you can, as by raising and binding.
And you must know that the restoration of the limb and its convalescence is easier than that of the bone in which the fracture has occurred
And so do all things according as will be remembered in each case.
May be if there are fractures in the bone, it is necessary to extend this limb fractured in two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two cords or with one cord and the hand.
And let your position be such that you can support the limb relaxed according to its natural figure, while the fractured parts are extended from the limb, so that you can restore those adhesions with engineering and in any way that you can in their places.
And take care that you do not cause further pain or injury to the patient by your operation of healing; and follow the treatment that you apply to a bone with another companion in many other forms
And you must take advantage at that moment of your touch with your hand in order to rectify any other cause, and if there is sometimes any other cause, rectify that and support that for the amount of your skill
And avoid violent extension and compression, just as wise doctors do who make use of cautery after their operation, or who make use of constriction in the limb in the way that we have seen in the operation of their veins.
And the quality of the stricture of the limb is that which I recommend; for you must know that fractured limbs are diverse in their size and greatness and in their form
And as for those that are small such as the arm and the finger and the toe and the like, the hour is that the covering should be of soft material.
And as for those that are large such as the thigh or the chest, cover that with firm and hard covering, which connects the great limb firmly and strengthens that throughout its extent without causing any bruising
And so do all things, pause the ligament conveniently at the place of that fracture with three covers or four as the limb deserves; and strengthen your hand a little on the ligament.
And so look at the most prominent part of the place of the fracture, and strengthen less than that where you have strengthened the place of the fracture And so lengthen the covering of the place of the fracture a little, and soften the stricture little by little, until you have taken away a great part of the limb
And thus take another instrument and wrap that other bandage around the limb to be bound firmly; and when the bandage has been placed in its place, proceed with the operation in the manner described previously concerning the first bandage.
And if there is a swelling in the area of the fracture, or if the limb is twisted, leave it as it is in such cases; otherwise do not touch it for any reason.
And place another instrument over it, and tightly bind over these bandages as much as necessary; if there is no swelling or oozing from the wound, and when the oozing has ceased and the swelling has subsided; leave that for a few days; and then remove the supports gradually as necessary
The supports of the major limb are of various kinds, and should be formed skillfully; or of wood; or of palm leaves; and the width of each support should be as follows: ...
However, the support which is placed over the fracture should be larger and wider than the others, and its length should be according to the size of the limb; and grasp the supports with another instrument according to your previous instructions; and tie them securely as we have said previously, so that the support is the most stable in the area of the fracture and the more the limb is elongated, the weaker the support should be
And it must be ensured that the threads are of moderate thickness and flexibility, and are of silk; and if the threads are thick, like those used for surgery in other places, it is a great error when the support is removed and equality is not restored
Subtle threads are not suitable for this purpose, for you will not achieve sufficient support in this way, and it must not be the case that there is less than a finger's breadth between the supports
And if the patient is suffering from excessive stiffness of the limbs at the extremities, support the limb in the places mentioned until the stiffness has disappeared without causing further injury
Some bandages for fractures are like ointments, and others are like disruptions of the cord, and I remind you of this in the chapter concerning singularity
Remember that every fractured limb is not straight at first; the reason for this is that when the limb is large, it is not appropriate to support it on the bandages immediately; rather wait a few days or even more, according to your estimate of the risk of oozing
This is the method of dressing which the Ancients used to restore fractures, dislocations and twists.
Method of dressing similar to that of the ancients, suitable for multiple complex fractures, especially for women and men, because of which it is not heated or cooled by the air: and take powdered charcoal, which is the middle of wheat that remains after the wheat has been ground.
And keep it moist like this, but do not make it wet; and cover it with a cloth that is not too thick or too thin; and use this as a dressing
Another method for plastering is for fracture, dislocation and sprain: recipe of asafoetida, of lapdanum, of acacia, of enula, and marigold, which is ground from a thousand grains of Salvago, by weight of two drams. Five of mirra and aloen by weight of one dram. Twenty of alochil by weight of two drams. All of these are triturated and sieved and mixed with water, with oil or with egg white if the patient's wound is raw; and use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores the broken bones pleasantly, and gives comfort to many people.
Another method for plastering which gives comfort for fracture and sprain: recipe of marigold and white alum at the rate of two drams. Five of mirra and aloen by weight of one dram. Six of acacia by weight of one dram. Two hundred of beeswax by weight of two hundred.
All of them are powdered in a mortar with a rough stone, are mixed, and are moistened with water or liquid and administered
Manieyra de emplaustre a juncturas e osses separatz de lors locs, e seda dolor accident en aquels e a fissuras e fractaduras: sia presa lana sutza e sia submersa en vi agre e oli cuyt e sia pausat sobre le loc.
In this dressing there is no virtue of restoration, but rather of calming the pain and driving out the cause of the pain properly.
Another method of dressing that restores broken bones: take figs and poppy seeds; mix them up and make a dressing of them
A short method of dressing that promotes the restoration of bone fractures and when you desire resolution of the remaining swelling: mix powdered elderberry, chamomile and violet flowers, barley flour, all in equal parts Put everything in a decoction and keep it warm, if the limb is not scorched
If it is scorched, however, keep it comfortable with lukewarm water or with vinegar and use it
Another method of dressing that is more powerful in resolving this is when the swelling is severe: mix elderberry and linseed seeds, barley, meadowsweet, marjoram, violets, chamomile, all in equal parts and fennel; put everything in a decoction and keep it warm with vinegar or water, or with wine, according to the quality of the limb and the degree of swelling
Hippocrates does not say that in the free air it should be placed over the fractured limb in order to promote its restoration, but rather that it should be covered with wax and oil and not otherwise; and I recommend that you rather use an intermediate degree between thickness and thinness
Indeed in Gaul they put it over the fractured limb in order to promote its restoration and the causes of its pain, such as small inflammation or cold, as well as its causes that we have recommended.
Method of dressing that relieves the lesion and pain: mix millet, chickpea flour, ground fennel seeds or pennyroyal seeds, elderberry, salt, all in equal parts; grind them together and sift them, and make a dressing of them
The quantity should be according to the degree of swelling that must be left on the limb, and if there is no pain or swelling or the bone is not fractured, it is not appropriate to remove it for a long time. And if there is acute pain or swelling or inflammation in the area, then in that hour you must cover it or remove it immediately, and keep the dressing on it
Take linen cloth and marine sponge soaked in warm water, and immerse that in lukewarm water; with that wash the area until the swelling and pain disappear; then put on a bandage with a soft bandage soaked in strong vinegar and olive oil or olive oil alone, and keep it on for a night until you are sure that the cautery has healed, and that the swelling of the limb has subsided, and that the pain has gone away.
And do the same with the stricture and put on a small dressing and do not bind it tightly for your initial constriction, but rather do it gradually as it improves.</start_of_turn>
And if sometimes the swelling and the redness and the pain and the inflammation and all these things have already subsided, and digestion of the dressing and the stricture has begun, then in that case you must repeat it as before, just as you did at the beginning when you put on the dressing.</start_of_turn>
And if no other cause appears in the limb of those that we have mentioned, then do not remove it for three or four days or five or seven days.</start_of_turn And some people keep it like this for xx days according to the appearance of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and when the coagulacion of the marrow over that has taken place.</start_of_turn
And when you adjust in the stricture more than in your initial stricture, and when you adjust in the nourishment of the patient's diet, according to the memory of that.</start_of_turn
Indeed if sometimes the limb of the fracture has dried out and become flexible again more than when you first covered it, know that nutrition is prohibited in that case; and therefore take away from that lukewarm water for three days; and loosen the stricture a little, and by this operation restore nutrition to the limb, and it will recover quickly.</start_of_turn
Indeed those who restore the fracture of the limb do not do as others when they do not restore it at the beginning, according to the custom; and they restore it according to their whim, which is an error in the operation of them, and is dangerous, and if they do that which increases the pain in the limb when it is free, they will aggravate it with that which they do.</start_of_turn
And I have never seen anyone do that, for it is more reasonable that it does not happen.
Chapter two: Of fractures when they happen in the head.</end_of_turn>
There are various kinds of fractures, and their figures are diverse, and their causes are different, for some fractures are caused by impact to the space, and the impact hinders all the bone within the cavity, which remains fractured, just as when it happens in the wrist; and for this reason this kind of fracture is called fracture of the bone; or the space impacts some part of the bone, and impacts the marrow without passing the incision through the back of the bone; and this kind of fracture is called absolute elevation.</end_of_turn>
And the swelling of these two fractures is great or little, and of a fracture that is contracted or contained; and the cause of these is impact with the palm of the hand or with the edge of the foot, and the like.</end_of_turn
And this fracture is penetrating that has already approached the bone which is left fractured; or it is on the face of the bone, and the swelling of these two fractures is great or little.</end_of_turn
Or the fracture is that which is hidden in the bone, in the substance of the small vessel, and for this reason it is called capillary fracture.</end_of_turn
And the fracture is caused by impact or by chance or by impact of the foot and it leaves an indentation in any lamina of the bone to the parts adjacent, and it is fractured in the hollow part just as when it happens to the nails when they are impacted and broken through.</end_of_turn
Mostly it is caused in bones of soft texture, as for example their heads.</end_of_turn
And thus all these stationary fractures are like separated stars.</end_of_turn And I find it necessary to remind you of everything in this place.</end_of_turn
And I know all these kinds of fractures by detection on them and by questioning them in order to detect any underlying corruption of the bone that is over them.</end_of_turn
The capillary fracture is known by this that it is discovered on the bone, and it is excised, and it is limited over it with a tent, so that the fracture appears black.</end_of_turn
In the treatment of fracture attention should be paid at the beginning to the signs of the illness, and when sometimes for the signs that may signify for significance appears with vomiting of bile, extension, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, syncope, fever, and acute pain in the joints and stiffness of those.</end_of_turn
And if sometimes non-violent accidents occur you expect health, the hour you begin the treatment of them.</end_of_turn
Which cause is that if it is verified in the beginning like that which is verified in the days of spring, the hour you must study in the marrow of the bone thirteen days according to all custom.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the summer days, the hour you must cover the bone thirteen days starting from the seventh day, having to keep that which is left of the bone corrupt from the marrow, and to take care of the accidents which we have recommended.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture has already reached the marrow covering the brain, and it is contracted and contained, the hour you must insert the fractured parts and bind them, as I recommend to you.</end_of_turn
And that you take the head of the illness that is inflamed, and you uncover the bone according to custom and manage as you are able according to the figure of the inflammation, and that you are curious about the illness.</end_of_turn
And if it happens to you that you detect the bone, flux of blood or caut abscess, the hour you oppose it with what covers it, and that you cover the area with clean cloth soaked in vinegar and oil, and make the swelling subside until the abscess is sedated; and be sure to drain the blood; and start the treatment by applying the bandage to the bone and opening the wound.</end_of_turn
And this is according to two methods of operation.</end_of_turn
And the first method is that you insert the bone with a straight incision, and this is how you do it: And you give another incision a little wider than the first; and this is how you do it.</end_of_turn
And you give more of the latter incision.</end_of_turn
And know that you must give your name as an inscription, for some of them are more lazy than others; and some of them are shorter than others and are at the back of the order of their extremities, and they are made of iron or venomous material.
And use of them [instruments] makes it easier to perform the incision on the inscription so that you do not break the head and leave it behind.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then cover that you pierce in the circumference of it before you administer the inscription, which are called superficial not deep
They are not called thus except that those who do not stop the term of the bone until they are close to it, because the superficial part of the limb or margin over that which the head of the limb is left behind appears like a margin or small circle, which prohibits it from being submerged and passing through the substance of the bone
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these superficial incisions, of which each one agrees with the substance of each bone, except in those cases where in all tests of the limb the extremity that is acute in length and breadth is such that the quantity in length and breadth is according to the quantity of substance of that limb.
And this is the form of three species of incisions: The quality of piercing in the circumference of the broken bone is that you stop the incision on the bone and rotate that around which you have tied it until you know that the bone has already been penetrated; and then change the incision to another place, and stop when there is between all the distance the quantity of the thickness of the ray or around that
And indeed incisions are made with the inscription when there is between each break of the bone, and make that one more subtle than you can over that in order to finish levitating, as we have said, until you have eradicated the bone, or with your hand, or by any other cause for some tremor that has appeared in it, such as nails and fine forceps
And know that you must take great care that the inscription does not touch any cause of infection.
And therefore when you have pierced the circumference of the bone, and if it is continuous with the infection if it is continued with it, then extract that, know that you should burn and cauterize that with the substance of the infection that is in the bone or another cause similar to an incision, but indeed that you must make it more tense and subtle than the others
And if there remains any small parts of bones and fragments, then take that which is convenient for you from the causes of the ailments; and indeed take care of the wound with lint and dressings as we have said.
And another way of operating is light, long, which says dissection Gaul and the lauzing for great profit; and this is the saying of it: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin to discover the part of the bone of the limb in which the fracture is the most vehement and most manifest, until when you have discovered that part and you have stopped leaving that limb that the incision is slow and peaceful of which this is the form:
And that the blunt part is round and does not touch any cause, and the acute part is of it in two directions before and after in length, as sometimes; that the blunt part is adjusted to the infection with the face of the acute incision on the bone.
And indeed pierce about the inscription with a little mallet so that you can insert all the bone easily as if it were rotated, and you will be sure of the safety that it will not happen by chance that you fear in any way, and if the physician was the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he was asleep.
And if there remains any adjacent cause to the bone of the cavity in several places, pierce that one with the extremity of the incision that is blunt, and deliver that one with ease, which is delivered from it without document and without fear.
And if the bone is not pierced into the cavity, and what is broken or remains of the bone is the face of it, and remains in it in asperities and subtle fragments, then know that you must burn that asperitat and extirpate those fragments with subtle reasons for those for which you have prepared the number, of various quantities so that you can easily manage them in all places and make the most of them according to what you lose in your operation that broken bone and its figure.
And know that you must administer in your reason the greatest part of those reasons at the beginning of the reasons, and indeed use the greatest part of the subtle of them, and do not stop until you have completed the greatest part and the most subtle of all those.
Indeed in any other small fractures capillary and subtle fracture, know that you must take care according to what you have lost for the rectification of it.
It is because of this that no learned person has been able to explain it in its entirety. Therefore, as we have said before in great fractures...
If the swelling is rectangular when you radiate it out, then take as much of the plaster as the amount of the wound and immerse it in scented oil, and place it over the orifice of the wound; and take another bandage doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and scented oil and place it over the first bandage, and do so until the pus comes out willingly from that place, without causing damage; and then give him some lard around that area, and do not tighten it until the wound is whole only as much as the wound itself
And leave it like this for a day or two until you are certain that the burn has subsided; and then remove the bandage and administer medicines which are useful for drying, such as linseed and barley flour, henbane and marjoram, and similar things to these
And it is necessary that you grind these medicines into powder and sprinkle them over the wound; and in general, give any medicine that has the property of drying, such as alum or mercury.
And take heed of your art that the wound in your care should be dry; do not put anything greasy on it or anything else; and do not let it become infected; for when it is applied to the swelling of the head, it corrupts that and impoverishes that, and brings about illness in the patient
And take care in the head, as when it is solidified it breaks the bones more and especially when the care is negligent; and it is black on its surface; and therefore consider that if an accident happens to the patient, the things that we have said are dangerous for him, because it is perilous in every way.
And if there is no blackness except for the medicine that has been stopped, and it is in virtue of that medicine that causes that blackness, then take three parts of vinegar and two parts of scented oil, in the proportion of three to two.</start_of_turn> And mix it with these ingredients a bandage, and place it on the swelling; and care for that with the spices of care which you consider to be useful until it is healed.</start_of_turn>

Of the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.</start_of_turn
Know that the nose is not fractured but simply bowed down somewhat, or one of these has been softened, so that in it there are two bones, for the part that is left is cartilaginous and is not fractured, and does not cause it any damage but swelling and pain and numbness.</start_of_turn
Moreover, if one of the two parts is fractured, then you must insert a little support in the nose, and stabilize that fracture with the index finger and the thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape.</start_of_turn And do this with ease, and take care that you do not cause any pain to the patient during this operation.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is in the lower part of the nose, and you say that it does not matter, then you must make it equal with the extremity of the ray where the thickness is small.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is in two parts, you must make it look like that.</start_of_turn
And cover its restoration on the first day of the fracture if possible; and if not, then leave it for a while or two until the burn subsides.</start_of_turn
And put in the extremity of the nose a wad of linen, if the fracture is in one part, or two cushions, if the fracture is in two parts, and make them of such thickness that they fill the cavity of the nose.</start_of_turn
And tell the old restorers that the cushions should be bound at the edges, and should be changed throughout the day, even though I do not see it; for you must know that the wad should be bound with almond paste with powdered charcoal; and do so until the bone is firm and the cartilage is solidified.</start_of_turn
And in some cases put sponges inside the nose instead of a cushion, because it is better for swelling; and that the patient should not be prohibited from inspiration even if the fracture of the nose is violent, for the patient will recover more quickly.</start_of_turn
This matter is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, do that.</start_of_turn
And if another bruise appears after the burn subsides, plaster the nose with wax or with soot moistened in wine and scented oil, or with vinegar.</start_of_turn
May it be that if the cautery does not happen to slip, then cover that part with meal of size and with a powder of burnt chaff with an album of honey; and immediately stop over it with a sponge, and do not leave it exposed for any reason.
If the bones of the nose are fractured in a slight or great degree, then split them open, and extract those with instruments that are suitable for them; and immediately close the wound, and care for that which encloses and consolidates, and apply plasters as necessary
And if there is a wound in the nose, then care for that which is causing the bleeding and administer lead tubes until it is completely healed.

Restoration of the mandible when it is fractured
When the mandible is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by bleeding, keep the fracture from displacement only if it is clearly displaced, and not fractured into two parts and bent outwards. In such a case, its sensation is light
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert the left index finger into the patient's mouth; and in the same way, if the fracture is on the left mandible, insert the index finger of the right hand; and grasp with that the swelling of the fracture outwards, with your other hand at the opposite side of the bone; thus you will easily equal the amount.
If the fracture of the mandible has already been separated into two, then administer extension of two parts according to rectitude until it is possible to equal them
If there is displacement of teeth with disruption, then strengthen those that you expect to remain in place with gold or silver or gutta percha; and immediately stop over the fractured mandible, and immediately stop over the duplicate tissue, and stop over the large pulp in place appropriately, or one piece of gutta percha equal to the length of the mandible; and tie that down according to what is appropriate for the libandage of the tooth and that which is convenient for the application, until it is not destroyed
Command the patient to rest and tranquility, and abstain from eating spicy foods for him
And if you see that the figure has already been altered in some way, then you will cover it up and take it off on the third day; and immediately correct what has already been altered of it and plaster that with powder of mill, with an album of honey, or with meal of size, because you must not leave it uncovered, and stop over the plaster sponge
And thus when it is fixed and adjusted that plaster over it, and the arrangement of the bone is not altered, leave it in place, do not take it out until it is healed and strengthen the fracture; for if the swelling of this fracture is not dispelled in three periods, it will not be healed
And if another wound occurs after the cautery, then administer what has been said above in the case of bleeding until it is healed, and remove that wound
And if the fracture is accompanied by bleeding, consider whether it is a fracture of the bone separated or sutures; in this case you are ordered to remove those sutures with what is convenient for the removal of those of the torment
And if the wound is wide, then you will enlarge it with the flebotome according to the quantity of your need
And when you have finally removed those sutures, and those that you will not remove, then you will close the wound if it is wide; otherwise, stop over that one of the plasters which you consider convenient and care for that, until it is healed

Restoration of the jaw when it is fractured
When the jaw is fractured from the front towards the back of the teeth, and that fracture is caused by one of three things.
Or it is fractured, or separated, or is separated into two parts without causing sutures; and it is desirable for the restoration of it; or it is just that it has occurred in the sutures, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is just that the fracture is accompanied by bleeding
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is accompanied by bleeding, is that two assistants be present, so that one may hold the fractured jaw and the other extend the cheek towards that part
And immediately bind the fracture with the said strings until the shape of it is restored according to what you cover, and not in too little or too much prominence
If the pain persists despite the extension, then let him rest his hand from the patient, hoping that some degree of the swelling will subside; and let the size of the elevation depend on the quantity of the need; extend and elevate the foot and cover the swelling with your hand until the fracture is reduced.
If it is not possible to retract the limb from the socket, in order that it does not slip further, then let the patient rest his face on his chest, and place a cushion under his arm, supporting it with a smaller cushion of equal size.
And the attendants must support the limb under the socket until the bone of the foot is elevated above the level of the socket, and when the fracture is reduced, grasp those parts which are above with your thumb and index finger
Even if the fracture is displaced and the limb is hanging down, let him rest on that and extract those satagias with ease
If it is retained in the bone, let you make an incision of the limb with one of the instruments which you have prepared beforehand, since you have already rested the foot from the discomfort which it caused; and the discomfort is of the kind of fist or nail of which this is the shape
It is similar to a wound of which this is the cavity; and let its width be according to what you need of it, according to the greatness of the bone or the thinness of it.
Let its length be as it is possible for the operation; that there be two limbs always, sometimes one limb is broad and the other narrow.</start_turn>
And if the disruption of the membrane which you have incised when you have extracted the foreign body from the bone is wide, and you are sure of its stability, then you adjust the two lips of the membrane together with sutures.</start_turn
And if the disruption is slight, or if you fear excessive bleeding, then you must cover the membrane with gauze and powder according to the quantity of the wound.</start_turn
And if bleeding should occur, let you apply pressure to the wound with wine vinegar and oil of rosemary and wine, and rest upon it.</start_turn
And finally, that the splint should not rest on the broken bone; and so that you see the patient every day, since when the ligament is softened or the splint is already softened, then you must rectify that and strengthen the bandage.</start_turn><end_turn>
And place the patient’s hand over the limb’s collar, and leave the hand resting from the limb for him to sleep with a small cushion; so that in this way the limb’s attendants are elevated from the side of this, and therefore the fracture of the foot is elevated with the elevation of the muscle; or that the arm is bound to the limb’s collar.</start_turn><end_turn
Do not remove the bandage if no bleeding occurs at the site or excessive bleeding, within twelve days.</start_turn><end_turn>
And renew the plaster if you have seen the face of the limb to it, and adjust in the stiffness and restore that and leave it until the fracture of the foot is restored and is coagulated.</start_turn><end_turn

Restoration of ankle fracture.</start_turn><end_turn
The ankle bone is fractured in the lateral part of the limb and is not fractured from the bone except for the margins.</start_turn><end_turn
And therefore when it is fractured in the limb – and it is fractured in the middle of the limb – and is not known except by touch, then according as the figure of the fracture forces you to prepare the limb and reduce that according to the natural figure in every way that is possible for you.</start_turn><end_turn
And thus pause your hand over the area of the heel, over the moles of millet and stop the lion; and pause the powder of marigold doubled; and pause over them the spatula as much as the total amount of the spatula or a little less.
If you leave the spatula concave in some of the area of the heel, then you grasp that concavity with the stop lion, and then put the spatula equally.</end_of_turn>
And thus stretch downwards with the tongue with constriction downwards and with tightening of the spatula until it does not remain slippery from the heel.</end_of_turn>
Consider the ligament in each day; and when it is softened, leave another unguided and tighten the spatula as much as the heel is slippery.</end_of_turn
And I hold the patient over the side of the bed like this.</end_of_turn>
And the spatula is restored in xx days or in .xxv.</end_of_turn>
And thus when this number is completed, then you dissolve the ligament, and you know with certainty that it is not from the bones from which you started, neither is its dissolution feared.</end_of_turn
And if you proceed from the heel bone and leave the tendon behind, then you cut over it, keep it, and do as we have said in the fracture of the scaphoid bone in apostema caudate with a burn if it happens here.</end_of_turn

Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot.</end_of_turn>
The foot has several veins that are fractured in the middle of the bone and there; more the extremities of the limb move backwards that so cicatrize and diminish.</end_of_turn
And concerning the accidents of the limb when the middle of the bone is fractured, it is that it inclines to the inner parts and causes great pain, and difficulty in walking, and coughing, and vomiting of blood; and it is declared in the cavity of the fractured bone and is not hidden from feeling.</end_of_turn
And the restoration of the limb is that you rest the patient on the two sides, and suspend between the buttocks of the limb a cushion; and then press the muscles of the limb, and adjust the flanks of the limb to the greatest of two sides, and stretch your hand over the area and execute the operation of the limb and in the equalization as much as is possible and as it is convenient, until you restore the shape of the bone as it was before.</end_of_turn
And thus pause over the plaster and stop and pause over the staple of a spatula of obsidian or of ivory and of its like in suspension, because you wrap that around it; and gently encircle that over the fractured bone that it is not crushed; and keep stretching that which is strict downward; and consider the ligament at all times, and when it is softened stretch that also.</end_of_turn
And if necessary you cause a loosening of that, you must correct the fracture or swelling or pain or apostema that occurs in the area, then you will cover that and remove the plaster and correct what happened in the manner of treatment of the limb; and thus reduce the plaster, sometimes up to the face; and adjust the stricture so that it is healthy.</end_of_turn

Of the restoration of the back when it is fractured.</end_of_turn
Know that the fracture of the back does not crack completely but in places that follow the two; and from the extremities of the limb from the front part does not happen except for what is cartilaginous.</end_of_turn And you must know that it is not hidden from feeling, you must inquire about it from those who know it.</end_of_turn
And the restoration is thus that you embrace the fracture as it is said according to the possible manner, except that you embrace as much as covers, and then plaster and strengthen the fractured bone with a staple, if you deem it necessary of that.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture of the back is declining to the inner parts, then it happens to the patient severe pain and puncture, just as if it were a puncture that happened to him who has pleuracy; and for that the bone puts on the membrane; and it happens to the difficulty of handling, and coughing, and vomiting of blood; and this is of great difficulty of treatment.</end_of_turn
And indeed the Ancients have invented in that way that they can move without bending.</end_of_turn
And from them it is said: cover that you stop feeding the patient who caused inflammation and swelling, so that the belly is uninflated and is extended, and the fracture is fixed to the parts outside.</end_of_turn
May we avoid this, lest it should cause unnecessary bleeding, if not otherwise; and if it has already happened, then it will help to prevent further bleeding.
I say to you that it is necessary to suspend it from the wind and that it should suffice for a while; for in this way it is like reasoning, but I fear that the wind will drive the moisture to the wound for its weakness.
I say to you: cover the wound with a bandage that is already immersed in cautery oil, and leave fine powder between the ribs until it is full; let the ligature be gentle when you wrap it around the circumference; and do the same with healing the disease with feeding and medicine
And if it causes violent constriction of the disease that does not suffer from this, and if you put the instrument through the wound, remember over the disease, for when you cover the wound, uncover the broken rib, and do the same with the instrument that preserves the belly, as is usually done, and that they come out easily, and take away that one.
And do the same with the two lips of the wound, if it is large, by stitching, and care for that which is under plaster until it is healed.</start_turn>
And if there is bleeding from the wound, immediately cover it with powdered charcoal in scented oil and hold it over the wound, and let the disease be cured with what covers the bleeding.</start_turn>

Restoration of fracture of the vertebra of the thigh and of the heel.
Some veins sometimes fracture the bones of the heel, and sometimes to them it is necessary to apply an at traction, just as it is with the vertebrae of the thigh. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he is well or not, consider that sometimes the veins are already softened and relaxed and sometimes they are soft and limp and dead and you cannot move them neither extend them nor flex them without causing them pain, if you tighten them they say that it is not well, and in such cases of adversity it is fatal.</start_turn
And if you touch them and find them constricted with the teeth and pierced, then you know that the bone of the limb is saved and the disease will heal with care.</start_turn
And if you see the vertebrae of the thigh like this and you want to know if it is well or not, consider the weight of the limb.</start_turn
Sometimes when it is softened, it is necessary to do what is necessary in the greatest number of cases, and when you lie over the two thighs, you feel the breeze and the evacuation of urine is forced from you, knowing that this is fatal, and you should not work on their care.</start_turn
May there be no other cause of this, for the cause is better and lighter.</start_turn
And the care of them is that you perforate with a cautery needle at the sensation of the bleeding that stops over the fractured vertebra, covered with scented oil alone, or with pieces of ground glass; and hold over that any vein that gives blood until the bleeding stops.</start_turn
And hold one of the existing and comfortable plasters, and strengthen over that which is ligament; and command the patient to rest and be calm and not to sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed.</start_turn
And if there is separation of the bone of the heel or any other cause that is already separated from it, then cover that part with a dressing and keep that bone; and do the same with the two lips of the wound, by stitching if it is large; and do the care of that which is under plaster until it is healed.</start_turn
And if the femur is fractured at the thigh end, and it is the end of the limb, then cover that part with the left hand on the buttocks and hold the fractured bone with the right hand as much as possible; and hold over it the plaster and bandage, if you do not mind, and strengthen that.</start_turn
And if you feel the heel fractured in it, then rest over that, and keep that, and care for the wound with the care that is usually done until it is healed.</start_turn

Restoration of the limb.</start_turn
The bones of the limb often break, and when they break, the fracture of them is nothing but a communication in the extremities of these and they are inscribed in the length and decline towards the inward parts; and it happens to the patient pain in the area and puncture, and the limb is stiff when fractured.</start_turn
The restoration of the limb is that you extend your hand over that which is over the fracture which is the shape of the limb.
If the fracture is at the extremity of the limb alone, then you embrace that part which is askew according to the proportion that it is displaced until it is restored to its natural position.</end_of_turn>
More so if the fracture is in the long bones or that already declines to the lower parts, then you make the patient lie on his belly until he is prepared for the restoration of that fracture.</end_of_turn And therefore when you have restored that, suspend your hand over the bandage, and then pause over the splinter of bone or cartilage, and hold tightly over the place where you do not fear puncture of the fracture or removal of the splinter.</end_of_turn
And embrace the concave part with that which lies over that which prevents the stricture according to equality, and command the patient to lie on his side or across his chest.</end_of_turn
More so if the accidental burn occurs, then you cease the extension of the limb and the restoration until the accidental burn has subsided, and pause over it until that which is before has departed; and then return to the restoration of the limb, and hold tight as before.</end_of_turn
And if it happens in the heel bones or they are fractured, then you must treat them.</end_of_turn>

Treatment for the fracture of the adjutorium.</end_of_turn>
The adjutorium is that which is between the hip bone and the head of the femur.</end_of_turn>
And if it is fractured, the restoration of the limb is in two ways, of which one is that you grasp the bone plate of middling thickness according to this shape:
And join at two extremities two ligaments, and then suspend it from the elevated place.</end_of_turn
And follow the patient on a cushion; and then put the fractured limb outside the bone until it reaches the tilt of the limb at the middle of which the curvature of the limb is attached.</end_of_turn
And if there is any other serious cause, or if the limb extends to the lower parts; and the physician should hold the fracture firmly in the greater trochanters, until the fracture returns as it should.</end_of_turn
And the other way is that the patient should be placed lying down on his shoulder and suspend the hand of the hip over the ligament; and command two assistants that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands; and the other hold his legs; and whichever of them extends to his part.</end_of_turn
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you must tighten over the fracture with the ligament and over that with the other ligament, and whichever of the two assistants extends both of his parts.</end_of_turn
Therefore if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, then you must cover that half of the ligament over the trochanter and the other half the fracture must be over the hip bone.</end_of_turn
Similarly if the fracture is near the hip bone, then you must cover that ligament over that place and that hip bone.</end_of_turn
Embrace that which is facilitated and convenient, and when it is restored as it should be according to what covers and is applied well, then hold that which is not accidental burn.</end_of_turn
More so if an accidental burn occurs, then leave the stricture for seven days, and pause over it a soft bandage soaked in vinegar and oil until the burn has healed, and then hold that once more.</end_of_turn
And the way to hold that is that you suspend the bandage over the fracture, and then pause the covering of the gauze over the bandage; and then adjust the limb over that adjutorium, and put your hand open over the muscle.</end_of_turn
And pause the sponge and tighten over the adjutorium the limb so that the limb is in place of splints, if it does not prevent any cause of the fractured bone.</end_of_turn
And use splints.</end_of_turn
And that the bandage over the fracture is that which is more flexible and more strong than the others; and pause between any two splints the width of a finger, and the length of the splints according to the fracture plus three fingers from the total extent.</end>
And hold over the splints at the stricture which I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.</end_of_turn
The stricture over the fractured area must be made even tighter. The more prolonged the fracture, the smaller the stricture should be
Therefore, if sometimes the situation of the bones and the stricture are as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its usual position, then do so slowly
If you fear post-traumatic swelling, then leave the stricture and the bones inside for seven days as we have said before
Then consider the ligament in all parts for three days so that it does not become inflamed in the fractured area; or abstinence from food is prohibited to prevent the limb from suffering from excessive tension due to the stricture; therefore rectify everything as we have said before.
Even if you are confident that no other cause of this exists, do not remove the ligament until three days have passed at the very least
Let the patient sleep on their side with their knees bent, and their hands resting on their stomach.
And suspend all nourishment with full lanolin ointment, and consider throughout the night or day that the fractured limb is not deformed or softened, or that the ligament is not damaged; therefore rectify everything with your skill.</start_turn>
Abstain from food for the patient according to the order we have given earlier, even if food is initially lukewarm; and make sure that the food is cold when served.</start_turn
Concerning the application of the dressing and the change of the bandage, keep them in place for forty days; and make sure that they are loosened and that baths are administered, and that the medications that correct this are administered along with them.</start_turn
If the fracture is old, do not remove the ligament and the bones until at least one month or two months have passed.</start_turn><end_turn>

Restoration of Fractures of the Arm.</start_of_turn>
The arm consists of two bones called the ulna and the radius; of which the former is small, and is called the olecranon, and the latter is large and is supported from beyond the little finger.</start_of_turn
And it is strong if only the larger bone is fractured, or if only the smaller bone is fractured, and it is very strong if both bones are fractured together.</start_of_turn
And when the smaller bone is fractured, the restoration of it is light, and its healing is easier.</start_of_turn
And when the larger bone is fractured beyond the little finger, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult.</start_of_turn
And the worst of all is when both bones are fractured together.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if the fractured bone is the smaller one, it is convenient for the doctor to postpone the restoration of it, which facilitates healing until it is healed.</start_of_turn
If the larger bone is fractured, however, it is necessary to prevent excessive extension.</start_of_turn
And if both bones are fractured together, you must absolutely prevent strong movement.</start_of_turn
You must also keep the limb still, restoring the limb and extending it on a cushion, with the palm of the hand below the other fingers, and the thumb below the others, and the forearm must be lower than the hand, and the patient must be placed over a cushion.</start_of_turn
And provide a cushion under the limb or around it, so that the patient does not move.</start_of_turn
And have one minister extend the arm from the side beyond the elbow with the palm of the hand facing inwards or towards the ligament, and another minister extend the forearm similarly.</start_of_turn
And the doctor should immobilize the bone until it has healed according to the best possible figure.</start_of_turn
If there is swelling of the bone, reduce all the pain in the area with your skill.</start_of_turn
If there appears a separated wound that does not seem to be healing, leave it open and do not attempt to restore it until you are confident that it will heal according to our instructions.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is painless, and I have already dealt with the singular case, take care of it.</start_of_turn
If an accident occurs during the beginning of your restoration, then line your wound with a circle of butter fat and white wax, and put more between spiciness and blandness, and stretch the butter fat over that which is strict and subtle until the accident is released; and afterwards leave the circle and stop the plaster prepared from powder of mallow with flour, and then stop the chills; and let the plaster be as solid as possible over that fracture that is more flexible and strong.
Indeed, the name of the arm bones is seen in the greater arrangements, or rather the fracture in a socket or in two sockets together.
Then stop your stricture over the area of the fracture that is more flexible and strong, and when more is required remove the restriction from the parts above the fracture or from the parts below it, stop the restriction a little more soft as is preceded by the memory of them at the beginning of the chapter
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be moist cloths, neither too firm nor too rough, the thread which is used to tighten should be neither too fine nor too thick, as we have recommended
Consider the limb and the ligament nearby for several days. And if any cause arises that requires rectification, as for example that which arises in the limb, then cover that limb with cold water until that cause ceases to exist.
And keep the limb still until the restoration is complete, and then remove the stricture
And if the restriction is already softened and the bone is already recovered and seems like those, then restore everything with your skill
And consider also if nutrition is prohibited from reaching the limb due to excessive restriction, because cover that little one and leave that for several days until it runs out, and then strengthen that one
If no other cause of those mentioned above occurs in the patient, then do not leave the dressing loose for about xx days or more of those
And let the patient suspend their hand for the movement of their limb, and make them sleep on their side two
And know that this fracture is restored in xxx days or in xxxii days, or that the limb is restored in xxviii days, and all this according to the nature of the complications and the abilities of the skill
Chapter XIII.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the thumb and the fingers
Know that in the thumb of the hand and in the knuckles of the fingers there must be a fracture, and it does not occur except with a wound covered with soft tissues
And when the hand is fractured or injured, then the patient must continue to move and rotate their limb without causing further damage, and place their hand over that which is extended
And the minister should extend the broken bones and the doctor should unite them until they are congruent with good congruence
Then stop the plaster and the bandage, if there is no further risk of caut; and remove the plaster according to the extent of the wound, and you have already wrapped that in butter fat
If the fracture is in the palm you must leave the belly of the palm uncovered, and make the patient keep their hand stretched out, and command the patient to strengthen that which is their fractured thumb; strengthen it with butter fat long
And let the limb be suspended in a soft butter fat, so that the limb is applied to the palm; strengthen that as well as you can
If the fracture is on the outside, then stop the plaster and another plaster on the inside of the palm, so that the hand is open and flexible; and stop the restriction, as the hand is rotated between the fingers with ligaments
And if there is a fracture in one of the knuckles of the fingers, if that is what is said, then unite it according to what is necessary and strengthen it with the palm of the hand, and if you wish, place a bandage on the little finger to elevate the fracture and prevent it from being crushed
And if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle, ring, index or thumb, unite them as a whole and bind them with the finger to which it is most appropriate; or bind them all together as a whole, which is better; or leave a small plaster on that little finger, as we have said before
Consider in your restoration, and indeed that, the disposition of the caut burn — in the surgical operation — against what is covered when any cause of those mentioned above occurs, as it is repeated in the narration.
Capitol XIV.
Chapter XIV.
When the bone of the thigh is fractured, it is commonly observed to convert to the outer side and towards the greater trochanter.</end_turn>
The restoration is carried out by tightening the ligament over the fracture and leaving the fractured area, while the patient lies on their stomach and on their face.</end_turn
And the minister extends all the ligament according to its quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.</end_turn
If it is near the thigh, then let the proper ligament be applied to the outer side at the fifth space, so that the extension is made there, and the other ligament leaves the fracture.</end_turn
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the bone, then let the proper ligament be applied to the inner side, and the extension be made towards the outer side.</end_turn
Then the doctor should gently seize the bone on both sides until it is reduced according to its natural inclination; and the bone is joined by good connection. The hand should be placed over the area to prevent further displacement.</end_turn If displacement occurs, leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides, and then return to your care.</end_turn>
The bandage should be tightly applied: cover the fracture with a hard bandage, and bend the knee two or three times, and remove any excess; and finally cover the limb up to the hip and the thigh.</end_turn
Long thread is passed inside between the thigh and the limb near the bone, and the extremities of the thread are fixed at the lower part of the two parts, and the thread is rotated over the limb and the thigh where there is excess bandage.</end_turn
Finally, rest on the thigh in the place of that fracture and put a stool on the limb bones.</end_turn
And fill the space between the limb and the thigh with warm cloths, so that the swelling is stopped.</end_turn
And gradually tighten the bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture with three wraps or four, and when you have almost reached the ligament of the place of the fracture, your bandage should be less tight and lighter and more soft.</end_turn></end_turn>
And extend the two extremities of the thread to the lower part of the foot until it reaches the heel, and tighten both ends of the staples from the other side so that the ligament is not strained from the knee joint.</end_turn></end_turn
And keep the bandage on for a while, until no displacement of the limb occurs, no further swelling or pain; and if any of these things happen, stop the treatment and rectify everything as has been said above, according to what we have mentioned above.</end_turn></end_turn
If the bone is very painful, leave it alone as much as possible; otherwise, remove it and treat the wound as before, until healing takes place.</end_turn></end_turn><end_turn>
And so many other remedies are applied to this fracture of the thigh as are adjusted to the staples, as we have said in the treatises and in the arms.</end_turn></end_turn><end_turn>
However, in the restoration of it in this way does not cause the patient to suffer; and if it is only restored, or if another bandage is applied to the other limb, it is necessary to keep the limb which is being treated immobile.</end_turn></end_turn><end_turn
And remember that the thigh is strengthened in forty days or a few months or a few weeks.</end_turn></end_turn><end_turn
Chapter XV.</end_turn></end_turn><end_turn>
Restoration of the fracture of the thigh bone.</end_turn></end_turn><end_turn
Remember that the fracture of the thigh bone is often accompanied by swelling, but it does not always happen.</end_turn></end_turn><end_turn
If it does happen, the fracture is not more than a fissure or break in the bone, and this is accompanied by swelling or pain, and about this the patient feels nothing.</end_turn></end_turn><end_turn
And the restoration is made in such a way that it is glued together again where it was fractured, and it is joined as well as possible for equality, facility and manufacture.</end_turn></end_turn><end_turn
And so, stop the bleeding and place your hand on that round stone, if you wish; and stretch out your hand from under your stricture to where it is convenient.
Consider all the precautions which have been recommended in other fractures, thus as with cautery and similar to those which are opposed to any accident which may arise until such time as the patient is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XVI.</end_of_turn>
Of the restoration of the fracture of the thigh.</end_of_turn
Know that in the thigh there are two bones, of which one is thick and is called the femur; and the other is slender and is called the fibula.</end_of_turn
And concerning the accidents which occur in each of these fractures which also occur in the bones of the arm, and for which restoration is necessary just as for the arm, and the operation for them is one.</end_of_turn
And if two bones are fractured together, the thigh is converted into many parts.</end_of_turn
And if the slender bone is fractured, the thigh is converted into fragments Denant.</end_of_turn
And if the thick bone is fractured, the thigh remains as before, and this is among the causes which you should not be ignorant of.</end_of_turn
And so, administer extension, equalization and suspension of the bands according to the healing.</end_of_turn
But indeed, if the fracture of the thigh is slight without great displacement, let the extension be milder and lighter, and relieve your power.</end_of_turn
And in the thigh there is some cause for an operation on the arm, and that is when you have healed the cracks and when you have completed all the works of the operation, then you will take hold of the flesh of the heel which is held back by the causes which were held back alone, and it will be sufficient to remove the white of the palm; mix these with the ones which are little in greatness, and do not be greedy, and let the length of these be according to the length of the thigh, and of the distance from the knee to the heel.</end_of_turn
And so, cover over any wound in two coverings according to their length, and place one over the part of the thigh from one side and the other from the other side, and let them be from the knee to the heel.</end_of_turn
And so, tie the two straps in three places at the two extremities and in the middle part, so that this structure prevents the thigh from leaning to the right and left, and is in a good position.</end_of_turn
And so, administer a bandage of flesh according to the length of the thigh; and keep the thigh fixed in it so that it conserves that movement.</end_of_turn
And more, cover more than when you fractured, and when it is properly placed.</end_of_turn
And so, consider every day the thigh and study it carefully, and you will keep it from apostemata and from inflammation or from other causes resembling these; and when any cause of these occurs, then you will remove it from it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XVII.</end_of_turn
Of the fracture of the heel and the bones of the foot and the toes.</end_of_turn
The heel does not usually fracture; however, in the bones of the foot some fractures occur; and in the toes fractures are rarely seen, and do not occur in them except in cases of great disposition.</end_of_turn
And if in the bones of the foot there is a fracture and sometimes those bones must be elevated between them, then you must place the foot on the prepared earth just as when going.</end_of_turn
And so, place one foot on what is elevated from those bones, and hold it, and press, and heal those until they are whole in the places.</end_of_turn
And so, stop the bleeding and hold out your hand, and place under the belly of the foot a little cushion on which are two balls of paste.</end_of_turn
And so, stretch out your hand from under the foot, because you have covered it with cloths and other causes of which you approve.</end_of_turn
And when three or four days have passed, then you will remove the ligament, because you will find the bones healed, or fractured or dislocated, and the operation in these is just as harmful as the disease.</end_of_turn
May it be so that if anyone says they are truncated, then restore those, and embrace them thus as before, just as I did and recommend to you in the restoration of these things of the hand. And thus pause the truncated finger steady according to the length of the finger; and place a little space between them; and leave this table there which I recommended to you, and strengthen that which is below stricture downward.</end_of_turn>
May it be so that if these bones are truncated two or three or more, then you pause over each finger the amount of covering enclosed in soft leather, and strengthen the table at the base of the foot, and stand upon one of the heads of the table to support the foot so that it has good retention.</end_of_turn>
And it is convenient for you to know that you must not neglect the other causes which I mentioned to you in other fractures of similar accidents; and be attentive to every accident except for this which I have mentioned.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XVIII.</end_turn>
Of fracture of the bone of the thigh and of the fibula and of the heel bone.</end_turn
When the bone of the thigh is truncated, then cease the pain in the sitting position, and incline that towards the part of the two a little, and keep it stretched behind.</end_turn
And thus fill the matrix with a cushion, and make a point on the bone of the thigh as you expect; and elevate the two little ones together little by little, until everything is forgotten until the part of the bone is back as you expect and the truncated bone returns.</end_turn
And thus sprinkle powder over the two of them; and when you wish to urinate, it facilitates the emptying of the bladder, and reduce and return that according to the manner in which you commenced, and then return the powder first.</end_turn
And do thus for seven days or until they are restored.</end_turn
And if you wish, take a once of alum and strengthen over the wound of them a tube of sponge; and insert all the bladder into the bone of the thigh, and sprinkle with oil in the tube until the bladder is filled until it is inflamed within the bone, because the fracture returns.</end_turn
And thus keep it filled with cushion and rest for some days as we have recommended, until it is healed.</end_turn
And when the fibula of the foot or of the thigh is truncated, then administer in the restoration and agility of them what we have recommended in the bone of the ankle.</end_turn
And what is broken is not hidden in these principal fractures, and that little pain is of little consequence, more especially to one who has studied this matter and used this book; for that fracture signifies to you in the greatest possibilities of treatment in the restoration and in the strengthening of them, and therefore understand well.</end_turn
But in the heel bone when it is truncated, take unguents of alum, and put the heel in that; and pause over its covering of fat, and be enveloped, and let it rest for three days or until it is healed.
Chapter XIX.</end_turn
Of the restoration of fractures of bones when they are inflamed.</end_turn
It is convenient in those to whom the fracture has happened with swelling, especially if the bone is large as the bone of the thigh or the assistant, or is similar to this, that you take care of them and give them rest as much as possible, even if the symptoms of swelling testify to the contrary as we have said.</end>
And if the swelling subsides, the hour is to cover that you keep the swelling in check by means of the powder which you have powdered over it, if for another reason it is not present.</end_turn
And thus commence to restore the fracture in that middle day, and do not prolong it, if it does not happen after that.</end_turn
May it be so that if after that there should happen suppuration, the hour is to leave the restoration of them until the suppuration has gone away, and do not approach them in the third day and the fourth of all, because you will cause other accidents.</end_turn
May it be so that if the fractured bone is prominent over the heel exposed, the hour is to perforate to reduce that and equalize that with your hands more easily and with little extension.</end_turn
May it be so that if the extension is not to your liking and the equality of them with the thighs is not sufficient, the hour is to reduce that with your hands more easily in this way; and the discomfort which is made by the iron is of seven or eight digits and the width is according to the quantity of the swelling; and for this it is necessary for the physician to anticipate these three or four according to the quantity which he deems appropriate for the care of the total fracture.</end_turn
And let it be round, and let it be in little excess so that it is not doubled over because of the pressure during the operation.
And let the acute end be at the part where there is a margin in the limbs; and let the dressing be taken off from the great toe to the heel, and from the middle downwards to the parts
This is the way to do it:
It is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", so it is rather pale.
Because it must be supported the acute limb raised above the prominent limb
And put it into a groove until the bone returns, and let it be equal to any equation
And therefore force yourself to equal the parts of the fracture between them, and if the fractured part is slight, and does not cause pain in good acceptance, then it is necessary that you insert the limb of that bone until the instrument has power over it
More than if you cannot reduce the bone in its entirety with what we have recommended, then cut away that which covers the incisions which we have said; or saw that with one of the saws in whatever manner is possible to you
And remove that which remains in the bone of roughness and small scales.
And when the bone is reduced, and the patient finds great pain, then know that the bone has not been returned to its natural place; and then do whatever you can to comfort the patient greatly
When your restoration is finished which you do to the bone, then immerse the limb in black styptic, and in summer especially, do not put it on greasy cloth or any other cause in which there is oil, for it makes it swell and corrupt
And immediately administer stars at the time of eating in addition to the restoration of the bone, and leave the wound uncovered until it has healed, as we insert the nails with forceps and use of bandages as much as the size of the wound requires
And take care that you do not strain the wound at the fracture, because many physicians have seen that this causes the limbs to become deformed or to cause death or serious illness, so it is better to be healed naturally And if the stricture is lax, soft, different from the stricture of other fractures
And if the wound is large or is a bad wound, and you fear concerning that limb any accidents that we have recommended, and you find pain in the area, then do not put on that bandage, but rather make a bandage of coarse cloth in that place instead of stars and strengthen it with those.
And when two or three days have passed since the wound has begun to heal, that in it there is generated a brace, then you must take off the bandage which you had placed over that with the wine, and immediately administer poultices, with which we are accustomed to treating wounds, thus as with mustard plaster and similar things.
And you must know that you must remove the dressing and consider the wound every day morning and evening until it is consolidated and stopped, and that the limb is prepared in such a way that the swelling will run away from the parts below without difficulty
If the wound has passed several days, and it is neither consolidated nor is it separated from the brace, then you know that here is a sitting of the small ones so that you can cover the wound again. And from those sitting ones those that are separated remain and extract, those that are not separated remain and cause the limb to swell and cause pain, pierce you to insert those according to what you can do
And if it happens to the wound that there are ulcers or swellings, so is a sign of gangrene, or another kind of corruption and decomposition, then you must know that you must stop what you were doing and take counsel with the chief physician who has been mentioned in the capital concerning the care of such a thing.
And when you have finished saying what you wanted and you appear before the limb: when it is greatly swollen, examine the limb as if it were the bone of the thigh or the heel and the attendants and be like those of the great limbs, and do not presume that you will draw out the limb, nor the extraction of it that many veguadas will cause because of which death; have it lie down until it has healed, for a strong limb will fall down by itself in approximately twenty or thirty days. And take care of the wound if you see it, and if not, leave it be
Capital twenty.</end_of_turn>
From the care of node which occurs in the remnants of any fracture.
Moist wounds cause this node to appear in the remnants of healing fractures, and more especially when it is near the joints, and is often accompanied by swelling of the limb; and it frequently hinders the natural movement of the limb.</end_of_turn>
Then consider if the node is recent and administer in this way medicines that have stypticized thus far, and observe, and see, and touch, and smell; and if any of these things are perceived, take some of them, or all of them, and mix them with vinegar or alum or urine, and apply that over the node in a paste, and bind those around it for good constriction.</end_of_turn>
And read the extraction that you must not remove that for moist days; and remove that and repeat this until the node is softened; or strengthen over that layer of lead descent, which has the property of softening all that is swollen in the limbs.</end_of_turn
More if the node is already converted to stone and has hardened and necessity compels you to open that cautiously, and when you have split that for the greater part of its circumference, you must remove the surplus and the surrounding fatty tissue, or cut that which is in the middle until it is softened; and care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXI.</end_of_turn>
Of the restoration of a fracture when it is restored and then keep the limb limp and still not according to its natural habit.</end_of_turn
When a bone fracture has been restored, and then keep the limb limp and still, then it is not useful for anything except for these causes: one is the multitude of solutions of the ligament and the laxity of the ligament which has become faulty; or for the excess of stricture of the ligaments so that the nutrient cannot flow to the limb; or for the multitude of superfluous emboli; or for excessive movement that is not in its time; or for weakness in the body of the patient and for lack of care.</end_of_turn
And the care of this is to give nourishment to the patient and make them comfortable until the healing has multiplied in them; and administer baths; and give them wine and tell them about it.</end_of_turn
And keep the limb still for a while, so that the limb does not impede the circulation of the nutrient, or continue to embolize it with water that boils over, until the nutrient returns to its natural figure.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXII.</end_of_turn
Of the care of fractured bones when they have been restored violently and prevent their operation from being carried out except for that which covers them.</end>
When an injury occurs to a limb which has already been restored, keep the healing of it at a gentle pace and in a prominent manner to the fractured bone and the node, and for this reason fear not to perform the natural operation of the limb, however, do not compel it so that you cause the limb to suffer.</end_of_turn
More already have many doctors and restorers who have done this who have made this known to us in our time; and this operation is not to be despised for fear of death.
More if the swelling and node are recent, then keep them covered with lukewarm water in which are many soft herbs, such as chamomile and rue, and meadowsweet, and it is useful to apply to them a paste of alum or oil of laurel, or take figs of rue and bind them with wool or linen thread.</end_of_turn
And many veins are dissolved with prolonged rubbing that is too rough, and are administered movements of the limb throughout the day.</end_of_turn
More if the violent pain has already passed and has become strong and converted to stone, and is caused by necessity, care must be taken of it with iron, for the pus that has been expelled from the node of that middle is not allowed to remain under the skin, and should be facilitated in that way in which it is solicited and studied.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXIII.</end_of_turn
About dislocation.</end_of_turn>
Dislocation is the sudden displacement of any joint of the limb, because it is prohibited from movement, and it is accompanied by the deformation of the limb, and causes great pain and damage to the patient.</end_of_turn
Therefore when an injury occurs in some dislocation, it is necessary to perforate immediately so that it can be reduced, and do not delay in reducing it, for if it is delayed, the limb is swollen and strong, and it is difficult to reduce the dislocation.</end_of_turn
And so, do not move or stretch during the time of the apostemacy, because vomiting brings spasms and pain to the bowels.
When this happens, cover the patient's face with a towel, and immediately stop vomiting; then bring cold water and oil to the member, and gently reduce it.</end_of_turn>
And all parts should be treated with the water from which the memory will remain in their place.</end_of_turn>
And thus I have ordered the heads of dislocation according to what precedes fracture; from the upper part of the body inwards to the lower part outwards.</end_of_turn
Chapter 24.</end_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocation of the jawbone.</end_of_turn
So the two mandibles are dislocated if they are not held apart; and the dislocation of both is useful in two ways: either because they are slightly displaced from their places and are slightly softened; or because they are completely dislocated and are completed, until they are softened at the junction when saliva from the stomach is introduced and it does not wish to open its mouth or to close it, and the tongue is swollen in its speech.</end_of_turn
If the dislocation is slight, it will return by itself with little cause.</end_of_turn
If the dislocation is complete and complicated, cover that it is administered reduction of it diligently, and do not delay.</end_of_turn
And so the minister has the patient's head, and the doctor inserts his thumb of his right hand into the root of the dislocation of the mandible downwards towards the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he inserts both thumbs together upwards, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the others say from the others that these are outside those which he swallows; and commands the patient to stop his jaws and let go of those that are outside these which he swallows; and the doctor swallows the mandible and closes the mandible until it returns to its place.</end_of_turn
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both mandibles are simultaneously dislocated, cover that you administer evaporation with cold water and oil, until it is useful to lighten the reduction of both and do not delay the reduction of both for too long, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And so when they return and are softened, close the patient's mouth and do not soften it, cover with those sponges of wool around the gums towards the cheek, and apply wax and oil rubbed; and hold tightly with ease.</end_of_turn
And let the patient sleep on his side, with his head resting between two pillows, so that neither side is numb; and do not force him to swallow for any reason; have the patient's tongue be bound either with a leather or silken thread, until when the pains are gone and the mandibles are not clenched, cover that he swallow again.</end_of_turn
And when administered gently, do not work on the opening of the patient's mouth because of eating and drinking and talking, until the mandible is healed and restored.</end_of_turn
And if the reduction of two mandibles is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and are not converted back to their places, cover that vomiting brings on fever and severe nausea, and that the patient's belly is highly alert, and that vomiting of pure anger is frequent.</end_of_turn
When you see this, know that it is in vain; and vomiting will cause that one to whom it has happened for a few days.</end_of_turn
Chapter 25.</end_of_turn
On the reduction of the dislocation of the sternum and the extremity of the muscle.</end_of_turn
The sternum is not dislocated from the side towards the flanks because of its continuity with the feet; and some say that it is dislocated at the upper part, and that is declared by feeling.</end_of_turn
And the restoration is that the patient grasps over his two sides and extends his arms.</end_of_turn And hold the area with your palm with strong pressure, so that it will return.</end_of_turn
And hold still over that plaster and sponges and stretch that.</end_of_turn
And the extremity of that which was previously bound will not be dislocated in any day; cover that it be reduced and softened as we have said and as is fitting for your equipment.</end_of_turn
And thus rest upon that swelling, and powder, and extract, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until they are healed.
And thus, in this treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from the bone socket
(The text continues with medical jargon and instructions, but is not translated here.)
On the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle
Be aware that the muscle is not dislocated in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the part of the tibia to the part below
And the second is that it is dislocated from the part under the muscle, and this is usual; and it is not dislocated from the back for the shoulder; and it is not dislocated from the front for the nerves
And mostly it is dislocated outwards beyond the tibia, and more so in those in which the flesh is little, willingly it is dislocated; more in those in which there are many bones, it is forced out with difficulty
And often this happens to the bones by percussion or by chance, and the muscle of it is loosened from the tendon, and is cured as it has already been dislocated
Therefore, when you are aware of this, proceed in the treatment of it
And it is known that the dislocation is at the lower part of the tibia; therefore you must distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the normal muscle, because you find among these different appearances; and you find at the head of the muscle a concavity facing towards the tibia as much as a drop of oil; and to the patient it is not possible to reduce the hand to the ankle, nor to move it in any way
If it is dislocated from the toes or from under the muscle, and you see it with your eyes, do not be deceived.
And in this dislocation, the reduction is easy when it is fresh and the patient is young
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises the hand of the patient above the lower part; and he places the toes behind the tibia of the patient, and raises the joint strongly to the socket; the minister raises the hand of the patient and extends it out; and he pauses for a moment so that it returns willingly
Moreover, if despite what we have said it does not return, when it has happened from the beginning of the dislocation, moving days, cover that the patient should be bathed in lukewarm water and be administered embrocation that softens and soothes as if it were soothes radish of height, and fennel, and meadowsweet in water, and be administered
And thus the patient should be rested on the two thighs and be kept from moving from the tibia until the swelling has gone down between elevation and traction, and the physician should place his hand over the head of the muscle, that it is not swollen at the lower part, and another minister should hold the head of the patient, that it is not swollen at the lower part, for as much as that is necessary for the swelling to return to the socket
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner: make sure there is a man standing beside the patient who is taller than the patient, and let him put his hand under the knee of the patient and lift the knee up to the lower part of the thigh until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister should pull the patient's hand away from the lower part of the thigh. And if the patient is groaning, cover him with something else, so that the dislocation will return immediately
And it is reduced immediately in another manner: and it is that a long staff is placed on the ground, the head of which is rounded like a mortar pestle, which is neither thick nor thin, and the patient is placed upon the head of the staff; since it is supported by the folds of the gown, the patient is standing according to the length of the staff, and the hand is extended outwards from the other side; and the body is stretched out from the other side with strength, so that the joint returns to the socket quickly
And if the reduction is difficult for all the causes that we have said, then use this treatment: take a staff as long as two palms and as wide as four fingers, and make the thickness of it broad enough to rest on the heel of the tibia in this way:
And thus rest on the rounded head put leather patches around it so that the staff does not damage the patient
And immediately suspend the patient's pulse, extend your hand or arm over the waist towards the lower parts, and tie the waist around the attendants and the arms and the hand.
Immediately suspend the arms on a support according to their width, and extend the hand towards the lower parts, and suspend the other limb from the other side, so that the joint is within.
And when the intestines are complete according to any way that you can, and when you have covered that you stop the pulse of the heel, prepare the powder of poppy and alum on all the muscles, even if it is twisted downwards, and strengthen the heel with a tight bandage; and the ligament is twisted on the dressing, and the hand is fixed to the chest, and is laid down, and do not move the hand for seven days
And cover that the patient should eat little food until the limb is comforted, because it is more likely to recover the health of the limb.
And the food should be given more often every seven or eight days or exercise a movement; and thus if it is stopped and is not softened, the hour has already healed
But if the joint is dislocated due to moisture that has happened to it or for another cause, the hour covers that it should be cauterized with three incisions, as it is said in the chapter of cautery
And if all this has been done and seven days have passed, the ligament is loosened and the joint is not stopped, and the dressing and the bandage are reduced over it slightly, and it is not stopped and is cut and cannot raise that limb towards the upper parts, because the nerves of the limb, which are at the head of the muscle, are already insensible or extended or softened, and you know that the joint will never be fixed in place forever
From the dislocation of that which is useful for the feet and the heel or the lower parts, the reduction is useful with impulse and extension towards the greatest extent, until it returns
And it should be administered in the other way, and care for that until it is healed
And if it happens that the healing is slow in the limb and the movement of the limb is delayed, the hour of the patient uses lukewarm water until that gravity is relieved and returns to its natural state
Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of the dislocation of the knee joint.</start_of_turn>
You know that the knee joint is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and that which is dislocated in all parts, and especially in the part which is above the part behind, and the dislocation of the limb is not hidden from you because it is present immediately or because it is perceived according to any figure which is dislocated, and when you adjust the knee which is dislocated you will immediately notice that the joint is concave and cannot bend the limb, or touch anything of that muscle.
And you must know that the knee, and reduce the dislocation as much as possible until it returns to its place after the caustic treatment, for if you see it after the caustic treatment, the reduction is difficult and it is not healed completely; and especially when it is in the lower part, because it is much worse in all other kinds of dislocation, and with greater pain, and many veins must be cut in order to achieve it.
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the hand of the limb is extended towards the two thighs, and the arms are expanded, and the hands of the doctor are over the knee and hold it, and the dressing covers the joint with the greater forces, or by the root of the palm until it returns to its place.</start_of_turn>
And even if the dislocation is in the upper part, the hour returns as soon as you bend the hand with your hand, except that you cut the knee at the root of the palm.</start_of_turn
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, the hour administers violent extension and great force.</start_of_turn
And two assistants extend the arms, and hold that support two assistants so that it is not remade behind the extension.</start_of_turn
And immediately twist the arms throughout the part, because it is wrapped around the hand of the limb, or ligament.</start_of_turn
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, unite some oil so that those things which help to lubricate the joint are there; and immediately reduce the joint with force until it returns.</start_of_turn
And thus the reduction should be carried out over that paste in which there is stickiness and exudation like an album of blood, and be drawn out with a stricture descending, and the arm should be suspended from the collar, and be left for several days.
And thus it should be loosened; and therefore if the joint is formed in the knee area, then you should loosen the ligament of it and leave it thus
And if the joint is not to be stretched, then you repeat the packing and the ligament, and leave it thus for several days until it is drawn out; and then loosen that one
More if by chance the joint is drawn towards the reduction, and the position is in movement, then administer moisture in bath and friction mild, and understand, until it is relieved; or rest over the joint without movement, since there is fatness; and bind it, and leave it thus for the day and the night. And thus leave it thus, and put that in the bath; and when it is finished, then you will gently massage the joint with temperate friction, and then repeat over that which was alleviated, so that it is comfortable, once, twice, and three times Corruption has already spread throughout the bones within the bath, until it is lined
And if you wish, rest over that wound of moist cow and scald it at the border and stretch over that; and do a few times, so that that which is moist will be reduced to its position.
Chapter XXVIII.
Of the care of dislocation of a limb, that is between the arm and the hand.
The dislocation of the hand frequently happens, and its reduction is easy, unlike that of the other joints, however it must be noted that the limb must not be too much displaced or that the dislocation happened with violent force.
And the reduction of the dislocation of the limb is to place the wrist of the patient over a table and extend the limb of that, and put your hand or palm over the area of the joint, and press that until it returns to its place
However it must be considered if the palm is already bowed towards the belly of the hand, then the patient must put two of his hands over a table at the time of extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is previous you must put two of the hand, then the position of the hand of the patient intrinsically over the table, so that the hand of the doctor covers that area of the joint
And thus if it returns quickly, well it is good; and if not, then you must stretch that over the paste giving up the apostema and leaving that; and do not repeat that, for if you do, you will suffer or will not be able to do the reduction any more than for several days
However the joint remains according to its stiffness; and do not note to the patient any cause, but that the hand is softened and cannot stretch any cause; for it is understood that the nerves are cut or crushed, and that it is not due to the limb itself but is stretched with a pointed cautery because of the position of the limb and the force which is conferred by the cause
Therefore when the limb is returned, then you rest over it the paste which we have recommended, and keep it stretched for five days; and then loosen it and keep it relaxed and exercise the hand
However if the movement of the limb is delayed and an accident happens in it any gravity, then you will gently massage that with cold water and do a few times with friction until it is relieved
Chapter XXIX
Of the care of the dislocation of the fingers.
Some times the fingers are dislocated throughout their entirety
And when any finger of those at the two of the palm or at the belly has been dislocated, then you must stretch the finger and impel the dislocation back to its place with your thumbs until it returns
And hold the tip of the finger, and suspend that beyond the part which has been dislocated, and leave that for two days
And thus suspend that and extend that until it is equal in that limb on that day
And if at night it does not happen, keep it bound according to that narration, and do not stop loosening that in the day and exercising with movement, and keep that in the night; and do that for several days until it is healed.
And keep it stable in that way, if it is dislocated at the belly of the hand, and keep that part there and do the first operation there until it is healed
And it is similar to what happens when it is displaced to the other parts.
When pain in the joints is caused by cold humors that infiltrate every part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And it is similar to what happens when it is displaced to the other parts.
When the dislocation of the bones of the thighs occurs, and the pain is very great, it is not enough to do anything but let the patient rest.
And so it is enough to say that the old doctors spoke of these things in a long and detailed way, from which we learn little; we shall therefore omit that which is useless and explain only what is necessary.
And it is cured only when it occurs in the thighs themselves with the cold which I recommend.<end_turn>
And let the patient's face be covered with a cushion and let the limb be supported so that it does not press on the foot.<end_turn>
And place another cushion under the knee and another under the toes of the foot.<end_turn
The servant has the foot, and does not hold it in a fossa; and another servant has the other foot in the same way as the first.<end_turn>
And so cover the head of the patient and hold the toes firmly together; and extend the limb from the knee to the foot and bind it there; and do the same with the other limb from the hip to the foot.
And so the servants extend the limb from the thigh to the foot, and do not hold the two thighs and the limbs of the buttocks in their places as has been said above.<end_turn>
And the doctor rests his palms on the bone with strength until it returns, or rests on a board, and let the patient adjust their feet on the board until it returns.
And if it does not return in this way, take a board whose breadth or length is equal to three palms, and support it on the wall where we said that the patient should put their foot in which the limb of the board rests.<end_turn And so hold the heel of the board on the bone, the doctor rests the feet on the other limb, and gently stretch until the thigh is fixed and returns to its place.<end_turn
Or if you wish, keep the patient’s thigh bone from rotating with your hand; and keep your foot on the ground under the heel of the thigh bone, which should reach from the hip bone to below the knee; and keep your hand from the hip bone to below the knee; and let the length from one thigh bone to the other be as much as from the thumb to the wrist of the hand, and that is enough in every thigh that is broken in this place, and that no part of the limb should be fixed to the ground so that it is not crushed.<end_turn
And let there be a rounded cushion in the place of the turn, and let it be rotated in the two thighs.<end_turn
And in the limb there is a break in the place where the cushion is placed, the length of which is equal to a palm from the side of the rotation; and in the other two thighs it is similar to that.<end_turn>
And so strengthen the ligaments which you have stretched in the foot of the patient in the break where the thigh bone is placed, and the ligaments which you have stretched in the thighs in the rotation where the feet are placed.<end_turn><end_turn>
And now you must assign a servant who will support the patient's turn with their hand, and the doctor should palpate the spine as we have said.
And when the spine is returned and the limb is palpably healed, then you must place three fingers of your hand over the area where the pain is, and stop; and place your hand over the area of the hernia so that it does not protrude again.
And just as we have said, use the patient's nourishment sparingly until they are healed
And if any swelling remains in the limb at the end of the healing process, then you must administer medicines that soften and soothe the limb during the course of treatment; these medicines have been recommended; and they are administered in that area like ointment of lead
And many physicians have observed swelling in the back of the spine of two, and it is cured by that dislocation; and that is the bone which has already been mentioned because it must not be affected by this medicine, for it will cause death to you
Chapter XXV
Of the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
You must know that the ankle joint and the muscle joint do not suffer anything other than dislocation alone, and not from any other affections that affect the other joints of the little toe with swelling and concave depression
And the ankle joint is dislocated in four ways, which is either upwards, downwards, forwards or backwards
Mostly it is dislocated upwards, and slightly forwards or backwards
And a sign of the dislocation of the ankle is that, when you adjust the limb of the patient who is healed with the limb of the patient who is suffering, the limb of the patient who is suffering appears longer and the heel appears more prominent than the limb that is healed; the limb cannot bend its knee without causing pain, and the limb is bowed outwards as far as the heel has been moved forward by the cautery
The sign of the dislocation of the ankle is that it is in the opposite direction of this one
The sign of the dislocation of the ankle is that the limb expands slightly, but it does not bend where it is painful; if it is forced to bend, it cannot do so without causing pain; the urine is retained and the swelling is excessive, and you must walk the patient on the talus bone
The sign of the dislocation of the ankle is that the heel does not expand, nor can it bend downwards where it is painful; the limb is shorter than the other, the swelling is softened, and the heel has been moved forward from that place
More reduction of these species of dislocation is that you consider, when, if the dislocation is old and ancient, that it has already passed its best; in this case you must not do anything for it, for it is not necessary for treatment in this case; and indeed you must not attempt to do anything for it, for it will cause death to you
More in the case where the dislocation is recent, and is one of the four kinds of dislocation, then you must support the joint and extend it upwards and downwards, and to the right and left, for it is strong and does not require any other treatment
More so, if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong minister and extend the limb of the patient from the lower part, or from the middle or from the ligament which is bound over the limb below the ankle; and another minister should grasp the limb of the patient and support their toes; and strengthen the ligament with another minister over the back of the ankle and hold another minister over the foot.
And the extension of the limb from the heel to the ankle or from the heel to the ankle bone, or from the back to the tibia or from the back to the fibula.
And the extension of all these until the patient’s limb is elevated to the height of the knee and remains hanging down
And this kind of extension is common to all four kinds of dislocation
Therefore, if the dislocation returns as we have said, it is well; and if not, then treatment is necessary in all four cases.
In the reduction of the limb itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is at the joints below, cover that the patient should rest upon the sitting bones; and immediately suspend the ligaments over the edge of the space in that place where between the head of the space and the place which is left to hang down; and extend the ligament from the part of the angulus to the highest part of the fork.
And immediately another minister should strengthen the patient's ankles, and measure the great space of the painful space and extend to the other side for violent extension, so that that which returned to the sitting place
And this kind of pus is lighter treatment than the one with which this limb is reduced than other kinds.
More if it is excused to you and you do not obey the order with this kind of treatment, however cover that the two feet of the patient be bound together with strong ligament, eagerly, over both ankles and both toes
And let the length of each by the quantity of four fingers, and let the painful limb be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
And immediately the patient should be suspended upon the head of the thigh, and that it be in the greater; and let the length of them from the earth be the quantity of two ankles.
And immediately command a a strong young man to shorten the head of the space, and that it be suspended with the patient another young man, and the other young man will shorten the limb with force pushing, so that the joint returns to the sitting place with speed.
However in the proper reduction, when the dislocation is at the outer part, cover that the patient follows his heel as we have recommended in the haven gelbozitat; and let the ligament be stretched over the painful limb itself and over the toes of it
And immediately two cushions are placed, one at the foot of the limb, and the other at the head; and cushions are placed adjusted to the middle of the limb which is left hanging over which damp cloth is wrapped, so that the patient is not moistened because the limb is between the patient's thighs, because you must extend to the other side not to be taut.
And immediately every minister extends their part, and the doctor with his hand grasps the reduction according to the art
And when the dislocation is at the ankle bones, it is necessary that the limb be extended eagerly, as it is according to this medical narration about the limb; and the doctor places the palm of his right hand over the painful ankle, and immediately grasp that with the other hand, and with that grasp pause that which was extended to the other side at the ankle bone
And if the dislocation is at the back parts, it is not necessary that the patient be extended to the toes, but it is elevated from the earth; because it is necessary that it be placed upon a hard cause, as if the ankle joint is dislocated to the outer parts, as we have said of the walking of the limb about two spans; and it is on its face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, there is no spasm.
And it is necessary that cold compression be administered on the area where the joint is located.
Therefore when the reduction is completed as we have said — and the signal of the limb's reduction is not hidden from you, that you extend two cushions from the patient, and when you have once placed those cushions and the patient extends his limb the sitting limb and expands that excuse, then you know that the limb as we have said is returned — and immediately you adjust two cushions and place them close together and extend with a bandage so that the ankle is not swollen in any of the parts; and keep the patient at rest for three days or for four.
And immediately unbind the ligament and the bandage, and compare one limb with the other.
However, if you see those cushions in the bandage, you know that the dislocation is already stopped, and then you may allow the patient to leave.
And if you see any cause of discomfort, you know that you must return and place that one again, and extend that one according to your first structure, and leave that one for three days.
And immediately remove that one, and make that one walk slowly for some days, until it is comforted
End of Document
From the care of dislocation of the toe.
The toe is dislocated in three ways, that is, towards the outer side, towards the inner side, and towards the greater side of the foot; but it is not dislocated towards the front.
And the sign of dislocation is that the patient applies pressure to the area with his hand; when he does so, the toe is confirmed to be dislocated
And the restoration of all these positions is that the physician must do nothing but remove the patient's hand which he has placed over the area; then extend his hand again; adhere two fingers to the side of the foot; put the foot between the thighs; and finally secure the toe to the palm of the hand, and hold those between the thighs over the toe until it returns to its place.
And the sign of recovery is that his hand adheres to the area without discomfort.
Then plaster that area and bind the limb to the area; and leave them bound for three days or four, and then remove them
And do not allow the patient to walk for a few days, until he is well and comfortable.
Moreover, if the dislocation was excusable, then administer strong extension to the ligaments which were previously treated in the care of the hip is narrated above
Chapter XXXIII.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of dislocation of the ankle
The ankle is sometimes sprained by slight displacement, and sometimes it is dislocated according to custom, and the dislocation is caused either by excessive inward pressure or excessive outward pressure
And the sign of dislocation is that sometimes the ankle swells from the part which is dislocated
But the treatment of its displacement is of little relief, and that it should be easily extended with the greatest comfort and must be equal when it returns
But in the treatment of dislocation according to custom, cover that he does nothing but remove the hand which he has placed over the area, and take hold of that which is behind the two of those in the middle of the foot
And put your right hand on the great toe and your left hand on the lesser toe of the foot in the place of the ankle
And pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and with your left hand for two spans, and then extend with your left; and press the bones of the foot against the right side of the limb.
And do this for two spans as we have counted
And press the bones of the foot to the limb for the third span, and you are at the ankle
Therefore, if it returns in one span or two according to this manner, and if sometimes the foot is equaled, it is good; otherwise, repeat the operation until it returns
Moreover, if the reduction is prohibited to you in this case, then make the patient walk on the toes over the ground, and stretch a little on the ground, and keep him between the thighs, and you have already cauterized over him so that he does not burn himself
And let the attendants of the patient hold his thighs, and another extend the foot with his greatest power or with the ligaments that lie over the ankle; and extend whichever minister you wish against the extension of the limb, and the heel of the foot retains that which was cauterized so that the body of the limb is not pulled towards the lower parts because of its extension
And the physician should embrace the dislocation with his thighs, and another attendant should hold the sound limb at the lower parts, so that the dislocation returns with ease
And thus when the dislocation has returned and its reduction has been declared, then remove the plaster and extend that which was tightly bound, and rejoin the limb to the limb with the bandage.
Beware or take care of the nerves which are behind the ankle, so that the ligament over that is not too tight and does not burn excessively
And let that be for two days or three; and if the ligament is softened, remove it
And remove it on the third day or the fourth, and prohibit the patient from walking for forty days May it be certain that if one must go forward despite that space, it is not in vain that the dislocation is not over and corrupted, and indeed that it does not receive care.
And if the heel should burn with the cautery, then know that you must administer it in the cessation of the pain which precedes our narrative in other places, for remedy and embrocation, until it is remauged.</end_of_turn>

And if the dislocation is in the hollow of the two bones of the foot, then know that you must cause the patient to sit on the ground or on a table, and be as if going forward.</end_of_turn
Then place your foot on the ground, and place your hand over the joint which you have just mentioned, and hold the foot so that it returns without appearing in the eminence.</end_of_turn
And place under the foot of the patient a board that covers the whole foot, which has two heads, and hold that which is stretched downwards and closed for three days; and remove that and let him walk again after six days, until it is healed and the recovery is ensured.</end_of_turn

And for this reason you must not presume that you can cure it alone, but rather that you must be learned in art, with long experience, merciful and humble, timely, not arrogant or presumptuous; and that you should use in the beginning of medicines that cause no further pain, only those that actually alleviate the pain, and that you should leave the patient to the divine judgment, not to your own judgment, for in whom hope of salvation appears, relief from the disease, and in whom you hope for salvation.</end_of_turn And thus you must work so hard to reduce it at the beginning of the cause, that you must indeed cause a cautery.</end_of_turn
And thus if the limb returns as we wish, then know that you must administer a regimen that causes a cautery and cures the swelling in which it is customary to mix desiccant herbs.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation is in a fractured bone and the two fragments are separated, then you must perforate the membrane of them, and do as we have said in the simple diseases of the same kind that is said above.</end_of_turn
