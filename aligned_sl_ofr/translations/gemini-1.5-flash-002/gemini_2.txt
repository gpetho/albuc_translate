O you, very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its completion, and I have made the end through its explanations and through its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is neglected in our region and is completely and utterly estranged, the science is lost and fragmented, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in the books of the ancients that hands have changed. And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are obscured and the science is alienated.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the arrangement of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will bring together the forms of the cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work with the addition of their declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good master of hands is found in our time, the art of medicine is prolonged. And it is necessary for him who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and muscles and their number, and the movement and the moving and resting veins, and the place of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that the name without the thing is much, and with the work is little; and similarly in the art of the hand.
We tell you in the introduction to this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the things said before, let him beware that he does not fall into error and that he does not kill men;
as I have seen many times several of those who meddle with this science and abandon themselves without science and without experience.
For I saw a foolish surgeon who cut an abscess of scrofula in the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; because so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another surgeon who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; so he carried away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to treat him, and I saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and I knew well that if it were cut he would die.
And I saw another surgeon who took on the treatment of a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the fracture there was a wound;
and the surgeon, full of ignorance, pulled the fracture over the wound with strong ligatures, and left no space for the wound to drain, and left it thus in that state;
and he instructed him not to untie it;
and it remained thus until the leg was completely swollen and the foot, and it came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hurried to come and untie the leg; and when I had untied it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But still, the corruption was already established in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was completely lost.
And I saw another case where a festering abscess burst, and then inflamed through the malice of its lord.
For a canker, when it is pure of melancholic humor, should not be touched with iron unless it is in such a place that one can remove everything that is corrupt.
And therefore, dear son, it is necessary that you know that manual work is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in many situations;
and I will show in each part of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore it is necessary that you guard yourself, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
So take up your arms cautiously, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that by the grace of God you come to salvation and are praised;
and leave the frightening diseases to serious practitioners;
and remove your instruments from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you may pass from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: Do not take on a serious illness unless you are called a fool.
I have composed this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is on fire cautery and on cautery with sharp medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and of the irons for cautery, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is of cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is of restoring dislocations and torsions, and similar things;
and is ordered from the head to the feet, and of the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of the help and harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help and harm are the longest speech and subtle science and the secret responses;
and of this many of the wise spoke, and agreed to this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery helps universally to every complexion where there is matter, except two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a complexion that is both hot and dry with matter, some differed and said that cautery is a great help; and others said the contrary: that cautery is of no use for an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot illness should not be treated with heat, nor with dryness;
and he who said the contrary said that cautery greatly helps a hot and dry illness that comes in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it sometimes by experiment.
And yet, let none meddle with it except he who has proven it, and who knows through long usage the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of the complexions of men, and the dispositions and the causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the space of time;
of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the doctors agreed and consented to the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater benefit than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and comes only to the member which is cooked, and harms no other member except a little.
Burning medicines spread from one member to another, and cause illnesses in the member that are difficult to cure; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is excess.
And this I have found by experiment and by the length of service and study that I have put into the art, and it was based on the truth of things;
and therefore I apologize for the length of the speech, for I do not wish to withhold from you the secret that lies in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels illnesses from the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on when cauteries should be performed, and chose springtime.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the arising harm is overcome by the help of the cautery; and especially if the cautery is for necessary pains, strong and urgent, which cannot wait until a greater harm comes to the limb.
And never think, dear son, as the foolish physicians do; for the illness that is healed by cautery has no relapse; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not as they think, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is better than medicine because of the speed of its action, and because of the virtue of its work and its mastery.
And it is possible that the illness sometimes returns according to the complexion of the patient and the location of the illness and its virulence;
and superfluities are gathered in him by the consumption of foods and similar things, unless cautery is administered in a place where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as cautery of the teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and this is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is useful after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for an illness and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Therefore it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is better than with iron, and they did not say this foolishly, but because of the quality of gold and the excellence of its substance;
and they said that the cautery site does not become putrid, but this is not true, for I have tested it, and have found it to be true in some men;
and cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it is immediately cooled;
and if it is heated too much; they do so in the fire; and thus there are enough impediments.
Now I have ordered this chapter from head to foot, so that the way may be easier to find.
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness in the brain, and there are two that are made because of an illness that is called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes and ears, and because of a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and likewise for all illnesses that come from coldness such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged with purgative medicine purifying the head three or four nights, according to what the strength and age and habit of the patient can endure; and then shave the patient's head.
And then make him sit cross-legged between your hands, and put his hands on his knees;
afterwards put the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle fingers will come, bleed him from there; then heat the cautery which is called "olive", of which this is the form: And place it on the spot marked with ink, and proceed downwards and inwards, moving your hand little by little and turning it; then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place to see if you see the bone even a little; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterwards take a little salt, and put it in water and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days;
afterwards, apply cotton soaked in butter; and leave it on until the burn is gone; afterwards treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon", until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it is cleansed; and therefore it heals better.
And some of them said that one should leave the cautery on so long that part of the bone is burned, and then one removes what is burned from the bone, and it is healed.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on so long, and burn so deeply that one removes bone as wide as the whorl that women put on their spindles, so that the humors may easily exit;
and one should leave the wound open for a long time; afterwards one should treat and heal it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be good at all, except in certain people where there is reason for fear;
and thus it seems to me that I ought to leave it;
for the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other limbs;
and likewise when the patient's head is weak by nature, and the first type of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and I use this method in such a case for a total cure.
When chronic pain comes to the whole head and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills which are called "cochie," and head purges, and oils, and plasters; and if cautery, as we have said before, is performed on him, and it is ineffective. Take care if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize a little below that cautery we mentioned above. Afterwards, make a cautery on each temple of the head down to the bone, as we said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "vessels"; and that is the place where cupping glasses are applied; and lighten your hand so that you do not reach down to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the temples be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the head cautery When in one part of the head sudden pain comes, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is purged by purifying medicines, and the other cures that I have mentioned in the division of illnesses have been done, and all this does not help: then make cauteries according to two methods, that is to say with a sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is that you take a slice of garlic, and remove the peel and cut it in two at the ends, and then cut the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the slice of garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, tie it and bind it well and leave it so for twelve hours; and then untie it and remove the slice of garlic, and leave the wound so for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the suppuration comes out.
Afterwards, treat it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do this with some burning medicines that I have written in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is in this manner. Heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the form of a bell or has a little curvature, and in the middle has a small opening;
and put it on the painful area, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the heart is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery does not burn, which is outside, and an abundance of blood flows.
Afterwards, put cotton in salt water, and put it on the area for three days; then put cotton soaked in butter there, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery that is called "cultellare", with the whole point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of diseases, and it does not improve, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned of medicine and of iron are not sufficient, then you must heat the cautery that is called "cultellare" until it is white;
and bleed thus over the painful area a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and be careful that you do not cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;
and beware of the mandible which moves when one eats, and the nerve should not be affected so that it moves and that spasms do not come to the patient, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting causes great fear and especially to one who is not skilled, and who is not learned and experienced; and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have described in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two knives; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the earache from coldness
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and solutions and other treatments that we have described in the division have been applied, and the pain does not cease, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which this is the form:
Afterwards, prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the place with ink; and let there be ten points around each ear;
afterwards treat the place until it is healed.
Of the torture of the mouth
A torture which ought to be cured by cautery is nothing but that which moves from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses;
and do not apply cautery to those that come from dryness and spasm of the nerves.
When you treat this kind of torture which moves from phlegm by means of hydragogue purgatives and head gargles, and this is not sufficient, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and place the cautery in the part that appears healthy, and make the cautery towards the head of the ear a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half the heart is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the curette that we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be a little thicker;
afterwards, treat the place as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place that is called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and let it be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient large herbs and pills that cleanse the brain;
after shaving the patient's head completely, and applying to the occiput the mustard plaster which is described in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the manner of the cautery: if one does it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good; and if he is not, make three cauteries in the middle of the head descending to the neck, and let there be a space of one thumb's breadth between each cautery;
and cure it like the others, and if you wish to add, and the patient is suffering, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and cure it until he is healed;
and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of herbs and of that which we have said before;
after shaving the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the deepest part of the flesh is burned, and lift your hand; afterwards treat it until it is healed, and it should be the cautery that is called "olivare" which we have mentioned before.
of epilepsy
Epileptics should not use fire cautery except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to purify the brain of humors and other treatments that we have described in the section when the patient is serious and suffers enough to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, give him gargles and mastication purifying the brain often with good foods;
after shaving the head in the middle, and make one cautery there according to what we have said before, and one cautery above the vessel, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and suffers, make cauteries for him as I have said for one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to the manner that I have described.
If the patient is a child, make for him one subtle cautery according to this manner:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or humors are corrupted and the phlegm is thick, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for one who has paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are leaning towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink whereby the brain is cleansed, according to what is described earlier in the section.
Afterwards, shave the head of the patient; Afterwards, make a linen compress, well-made, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and the patient sits cross-legged, and is well supported on all sides;
Afterwards, present the liniment, and old sheep butter is suitable; and warm it by the fire moderately, so that the fingers, if one puts them in, can bear it; Afterwards, empty the circle inside on the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient each week once, along with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, by making several points throughout the cautery.
This method of cautery moistens the brain evenly;
and then apply moistened cotton in butter and chicken fat.
of the water of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and guards it from all moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times fasting.
Afterwards instruct him to raise his head, and cauterize him in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is to both eyes together, or one if the descent is to one;
and cut with the whole cautery all the veins and arteries that are below the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and beware of excessive bleeding, and if you see too much blood issue forth, then staunch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the precaution how you will staunch it;
and sometimes a cautery is made or applied under the two bones behind.
and one sees that it is of cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make for him the cautery that I have said in the beginning of the descending water to the eyes: I cautery in the middle of the head, and II cauteries on the two temples, and II cauteries on the nape of the neck under the two bones; and if there is more need, then cauterize him wisely above the eyebrow with one small cautery.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and he does not improve, then give the patient to drink III poppy heads; after raise the head, and make a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery which is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery that you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery which is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize with this cautery which is called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
of the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyes are turned inwards, and prick the eye, and there one makes cauteries according to two methods: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even; and if they prick at their roots, hold his eyes steady so that they do not move until they grow.
When they have grown and are even, then place the patient in your care; afterwards, draw on the skin with the eyes a figure like the leaf of myrtle, and let the beginning of the mark be next to the hairs;
then apply cotton soaked in egg white and parsley poultice to the eye, then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
Afterwards cauterize over the figure that you have marked little by little many times, so that the flesh is burned in that place;
and the sign of the success of the work is that you see the skin contract, and the hairs raised at the point of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it so for three days, then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed; afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after that the hairs grow, and the skin is softened then begin the cautery again on that same place, as you did before;
and if the hairs are missing, cauterize until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery with burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take of French soap and quicklime, of each one ounce, and grind them well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the form that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and place it on the skin; and if the disease affects only one eye, one should operate on one, and if on both, likewise; and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and the head of the patient should be in your lap and put your index finger on the medicine, and press it a little and move it every time the patient feels the burning of the medicine, for it burns as if with fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the burning has passed, lift the place with water, and see if you see the skin raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is well.
If not, put more medicine on the place where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are focused;
then put on cotton soaked in butter until the burnt flesh falls off, afterwards treat the place with the ointment that is called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if it is necessary that you guard yourself well in your work with great care that the medicine does not fall into the eyes.
And if the scab becomes soft afterwards, and the hairs prick at the eye, start the medicine again on that place which is softened by the scab properly, as you did before; afterwards treat it until it is healed;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size and smallness, and according to that should be your constraints;
and the right way should not be hidden from him who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not help, then you must cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to put his head in your lap; and let the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he does not move, nor shake his head;
then put moistened cotton in egg white or in parsley juice on the eye;
afterwards heat the cautery which is like this:
and is shaped at the head like a vulture's feather, together with which is the cautery;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a tent;
however, the one shaped like this is better for your work.
Afterwards press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, open it, and draw out the matter;
afterwards apply the hot cautery, and hold your hand on the cautery at the part of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not waver; and place the cautery in the fatty tissue of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you reach the bone with the cautery at the beginning, it would be good. If not, repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days;
afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, apply a corrosive watery medicine until the bone is uncovered; and treat it according to what is found in its chapter.
And there is a method of cauterizing a fistula that some of the ancients described. Attend to the fistula, and cut the place; afterwards put into the fissure one subtle cauterizing agent of which this is the form: and make it in the quantity of a third of a lead weight; and hold your hand with the cautery firmly, and let not the patient move at all, lest the melted lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one place on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
the lead thus burns the place of the fistula, and heals it by marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good. If not, it is necessary to administer a probe to the nose, and to bring the fistula back to the body of the nose according to what is necessary in its proper place.
of the cracks in the lips Very often cracks appear on the lips which are called "chapped lips," and especially on the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife-cautery according to this form:
And apply it quickly to those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards treat the area with cerate until it is healed.
When an abscess appears in the root of the throat or in the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it has formed pus and broken and is mature and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does not improve: then it is necessary that you apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and the furthest point;
and do so once or twice, after treating it as we have said in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and it does not work, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose form will come later in such a way that you place a chain on the tooth;
and put the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
then lift your hand and repeat the cautery according to your will;
afterwards let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and spit it out.
And in this manner the tooth which was moving is thus strengthened, and the softened gums are restrained, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Of the toothache
When toothache comes from coldness, or there is coldness or pain, and the cures of medicine are of no use, then cautery is needed in two ways: and cautery by butter and cautery by fire.
Cautery by butter is such that you take butter of a cow, and put the end of it in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent, and moisten it in boiling butter, and apply it to the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it is cooled;
and thus do it often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, moisten wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put on a hot iron until the fire reaches the end of the tooth.
Cauterization with fire is such that you take an iron or bronze rod, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient;
then heat the cautery, of which the shape will come later, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter at the time of this cautery, and then rinse it strongly;
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whichever head you wish, and according to what you have power;
and this is the shape of the chain:
of the scrofula When the scrofula are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery head, of which the form follows, and let it have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and apply the hot cautery to the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is healed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and tents until it is healed.
When humors overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold constitution, then the patient must first be purged by purgative medicines;
afterwards apply a cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat, and not to burn near the heart but a little.
Afterwards apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the head of the spine, and let the cautery be that which is called "clavile", of which we have the form before;
and treat the area as we have said before until it is healed.
When all or a lung disease is from cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the disease is chronic, apply two cauteries on the clavicle in empty spaces; and one other cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cautery which is called "clavicle" be according to the form which is described above.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking with the entire cautery which is called "points," the form of which is given above, in the illness of the ears;
and let the points be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After, cure the place according to what is said above, and let the cautery be in three rows according to this form:
And for this reason the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on his back and on his side; afterwards lift the heart which is inside the pericardium with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated internally, heat the cautery which has two nerves of which this is the form:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces it to the side, and the figure of the cautery would come together with four cauteries;
and for this reason a cautery is made with the cautery which has three nerves, because of which the figures of cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent peg and this is the form of the cautery which has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to it, because of which there are eight cauteries.
Afterwards, apply the cautery with crushed parsley and salt; afterwards make the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated upwards, which happens rarely, then apply a cautery on the thickness of the clavicle cautery, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When in the stomach come colds and much moisture to the point that it alters its complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied in it, and the usual methods of treatment do not help, then the patient must be laid on his back, and stretch his legs and arms. After this, make three cauteries: one under the hollow of the breast the size of a finger, with the entire clavicle cautery, and two cauteries on the outer sides, so that the shape of the cauteries is triangular, and have such a space between each that they are not joined together when they discharge pus;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and bleeding on the stomach at one point according to the amount you wish to draw out; then cauterize with the whole cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When pain in the liver comes from cold and moisture and great flatulence, so that it is far removed from its natural complexion by superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said in the divisions, and it does not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient be bled on his vein; and mark three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, there where the ribs of a man come;
and let there be a space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be lengthwise along the body, and do not press your hand too much on the whole cautery;
and let only half the heart be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him be lying down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if it is your will, cauterize these cauteries with a curette, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the whole heart, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not come to a boil, for the heart is very delicate in that place, and know this for certain.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient does not feel very strong pain;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels excruciating pain.
And then when this treatment weakens the eyes, it is necessary that the patient be supported on his head;
and then bleed from the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which here is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and it reaches the sheath, until the perforation is completely through;
after the treatment according to the treatment of fistulas until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that anyone use this cautery except he who has studied for a long time in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these illnesses have run several times.
Then he can boldly operate, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it.
Of the cautery of pleurisy
The ancients said that for pleurisy one should make cauteries of the roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: take a root of long aristolochia, the largest that you can find, and let it be dry, and let it be as thick and as long as your fingers; and moisten it in oil, and hold it in the fire, and cauterize, I cautery between the clavicle and the neck, and II small cauteries a little lower down in the part which is under the chin;
and II cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, leaning slightly backward; and I cautery in the middle of the breast, and I other on the stomach, and I between the two shoulders, and II at the two sides of the breast outside the cautery which is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but act openly as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use a fire cautery resembling a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess; and the pain leaps out, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this work there is fear that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula results which cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse, in the way we have described in the divisions of treatments, and it does not improve, then there are three kinds of cautery that are all good.
Of which one method is that you make three or four cauteries, in a line according to the length of the mouse, according to the figure of the liver cautery that we have described before;
and do not press your hand on the entire cautery, and let the patient often lie on his back;
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two points, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is in the place of the mouse, where the patient's side lies towards the left, and let the elevations by which you lift the heart be according to the heart, according to the length of the body, and the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
Afterwards, put the two burning points in until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the whole cautery with three points.
After the cure, when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other cures mentioned above.
Cautery is of no use for a dropsical person, except in the manner which is called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the sections, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on the back along the spine, and one near the breast; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not neglect the treatment of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be together with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the abdomen should be the little nail that we have shown before; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is shown above.
When the feet are swollen in one who is dropsical, and are full of citrine water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the citrine water should escape, and let the cautery be according to this form:
Afterwards, make on the two legs two cauteries on each leg at the point of the knife; and let the cauteries be lengthwise, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open a long time without cleaning, so that the water may flow out;
after the treatment of the other treatments that we have mentioned.
When looseness of the bowels comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive virtues which are in the stomach and intestine are weakened, and cannot be cured by methods of treatment; and you see the patient well-suffering and of strong virtue, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been spoken of above in the cautery of the stomach, a circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the navel with one small, pointed cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the wrist, and one cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach beside the large one, for the treatment is beneficial when there is good assistance.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in the divisions, and it does not benefit, then make cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, that which is entirely outside below the armpit little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the navel two fingers' breadth;
And if you think that his stomach is cold, and the food does not digest, and one sees the face swell, then make one large cautery on the stomach, as is said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the entire cautery-iron; and leave the cautery open a long time. After, cure the place until it is healed.
When you cut the thelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then apply it, burning hot, to that cut thelul; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much thelul, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards treat with beneficial ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on alchatim, it will have greater benefit.
When the patient cannot tolerate incision or opening, which we will discuss in its place, such an illness arises that it cannot be cured except by cautery.
When a fistula occurs in someone, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupted moisture, you should probe it entirely with a thin tent, and ensure you know exactly how deep the tent goes.
Afterwards, heat the cautery, which resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula according to how far the tent entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupt flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the extent of its need;
and beware of burning the nerves which are there, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and the intestine, beware of those places, and do not apply the fire except to fleshy areas, and ensure that it is not penetrating;
Afterwards, treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed, and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed;
and if the matter is not removed, know that the area is perforated, and the bone at the bottom is corrupt; and thus like one of those that we shall mention in its place.
When cold pain comes to the kidneys, and from great flatulence, and he does not desire women, then it is necessary that you make him a cautery on the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery iron that we have previously mentioned;
and if we cauterize in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and they will give greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then make a cautery in the outer part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the width of a thumb;
and make one cautery on the outside of the back, or two if you need them;
and let the cautery be peg-shaped according to the form previously mentioned.
When the womb is cold and moist, and does not allow conception, and the flowers (menstruation) are corrupted and their times delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the buttocks, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back;
and let the cautery be with a hot iron, as we have said.
When the viscous humors descend to the hip joint, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient over the hip joint with one cautery resembling a circle, and bleed in front of the place around the joint as it turns, so that the joint is inside the circle;
and let the cautery be like that with which one cauterizes the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three cauteries of olive size, and let the cauteries be as deep as the heart;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the hip pain When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not effective, and the illness is old: then you must purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. Afterwards, apply a cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is done in many ways, one of which is this:
that you cauterize on the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and wide, and have between each cautery the width of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, so there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have mentioned before in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the thick parts of the flesh are burned.
And this is the method used in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not reach the thigh or leg.
And if it reaches the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, slightly on the left side;
and let the cautery be knife-shaped, and let the thickness of the flesh be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes or near them, cauterize where he feels the pain, three or four points with the cautery which is called "points". And if necessary, make more.
And if the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a knife-shaped or circular cautery, and take great care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery on so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have made cautery on the ankle of the foot, and left it on so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot also, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a bowel movement, from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make a cautery in one and in the other, in this manner.
And the wise men said, in the cautery of the hip, of which this is the manner, make an iron like this and let its head be as thick as a date-stone, or a little less, and let it be between the ridges and let it be from one ridge to the other in width the quantity of a thumb's joint;
and let the ridges be open on two sides, and let them be also like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle;
and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and glowing, and then put it on the hip joint which is ill, and let it be turned toward the healthy side;
and cauterize it once, a round cautery, and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use little of this cautery because of the fear of its effect, and we see few who use it;
and yet it is one of the good cauteries, for those who can endure it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with notches in which the edge of the door descends, and it should be of bronze or iron with one long side, and in height it should have two fingers’ breadth, and between each the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and they should be open outside and above, and join together according to this form:
Afterwards, place the box on the hip of the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand very much on the box of the hip; afterwards pour between the two circles of hot water which has been heated over the fire a little, and leave it for an hour, and let the patient suffer the heat and burning from it.
For it produces a burning sensation like that of fire;
and when the burning is past, lift your hand with the instrument and lift the hip from the water, and leave it so for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the scald is removed; and leave it for three days so that the corruption is drawn out;
and this would be the last aid after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make for it an instrument that holds water according to what you have done to the hip equally;
and this is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it;
where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it; and put on top of that pot another well-sealed pot, and put on top alkali and lime and sweet water, until there is two fingers' depth above the powders once you have pressed it well with your hand;
and leave it thus until water descends and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong water and is administered in many medical procedures and in cauteries of other members.
For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well, such as tesisie and honey and anacardi and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of hip pain and sciatica, and praises it highly, and says that no other cure was performed, and that he was healed at once when this cure was performed, and he bathed himself as he teaches hereafter.
And he says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it very finely with one handful of fat, and apply it to the hip and thigh and leg where the pain is, and bind it;
and leave it for three hours and according to the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is somewhat warmed, and make him enter the bed, and the pain will all go away and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of humors.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps greatly;
and the cautery should be done in this manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and put it on the small pit that is between the thumb of the foot and the other which is called foscile.
Afterwards take dried goat dung, and heat it in the fire until it is coals, and put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do it again in this way, and do not cease to do so until you think by feeling that it reaches down to the hip, and that the pain is ceased;
and this manner of cautery is called "goat cautery".
Of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from a fall or from a blow or from too great an evacuation, or from similar spread cold matter, in none of these instances is cautery useful, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is purged of foul pills or other similar things, that three lines be marked on his back with ink, where the pain is, and in each line five cauteries or more according to the strength and the amount that the patient can endure;
and let the cautery be done according to the cautery which is called "points";
and if you wish, make three cauteries or four with the middle nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the sign of the beginning is that they have shortness of breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in us the appearance which comes upon the other spines.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with the circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery takes each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery two or three lines, and let the points be close to one another.
After, cure the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not apply cautery to a gibbosity which is in a spasm of the nerve.
Of the pain of the joints
When joint pain is from humors that are spread to each member of the body, and when pain comes in the feet, which the physicians properly call "podagra," and when it is from a cold cause and cures of medicines cannot cure it, then it is cured by cautery in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if there is need that you cauterize on the surface of the foot, make for it a cautery with the whole cautery that one calls a "point". And if the pains reach to the knees and to the other joints, and this happens many times, make for it cauteries on each knee, three or four cauteries on each side, with the whole olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, then make more, but do not keep your hand there any longer than until the thickness of the skin is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and to the back, administer to it the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist two lines;
and if some pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the hair of the hand;
and if the pains come down to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and take medicines.
For if you give him good care and you purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend to the testicles and it is recent, it is necessary that when you wish to cure it, he does not eat that day; and that he uses things that loosen the belly, so that the feces descend from his belly;
Afterwards, make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the bowels are replaced, and push them back with your fingers, and make an incision below the rupture on the pubic bone, and with a mark that is similar to half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
until it is white and it throws off sparks. Then replace the bowels in their place; and the assistant should hold his hand above so that they do not return back;
and spread the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion underneath him and a servant on his thighs, and another on his chest who holds his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, then repeat it again until you reach the bone; and be careful that the bowel does not protrude when you apply the cautery; lest you burn it; and that the patient does not die from this, or suffer other harm.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small according to their size, and for adults large according to their size;
after three days, treat the cauterized area with butter until the burn is gone;
afterwards treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well sealed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be light for a long time, so that his bowels do not move when he attempts to walk around.
And after forty days, when he wishes to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and let him wear it for another forty days;
and let him have good rest, that he work little and guard himself from too great repletion of drink and food, and from too loud laughter;
and when he has followed this instruction he is completely healed.
And I will describe the treatment of a wound in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they are not growing, apply a cautery to it according to its size, and let a third of the core be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize it with a three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the place with a pin and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and hold your hand in the middle with the whole cautery firmly.
But the first cautery is lighter and milder.
of old pain in any limb When pain comes in any limb, whether from a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is of no avail, then it must be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points," and let the cautery be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and its weakness and its strength and its location of twists and its pain.
If it is healed by the first cautery, that is good;
if not, begin another cautery on top of that one, for such is the custom that it must move to the limb that is nearest, wherefore it is necessary that you make cauteries until the patient is healed.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with great benefit, and similarly the illness that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it cauterized, take care if the illness is at the beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend or remain, and you doubt that the corruption will seize the whole patient, then make five cauteries on his head: one in the middle of the head at the nape, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize on the temple according to what is before.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere; and it appears manifestly, then you must cauterize it with the cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the bridge of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and one other beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the buttocks, and two on the breasts, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cautery on the bone of the wrist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits him;
and know that the patient does not feel any pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already all corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the types of irons.
After, cure the place with vetch flour with honey and other cures until it is healed.
When an inflammation comes in a limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size of the limb;
and let the cautery be a little penetrating into the thickness of the flesh; then cure it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is made on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the inflammation is removed;
and nevertheless let no one meddle with it unless he is knowledgeable of the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the illness which is called "albaras" is chronic, and the means of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery somewhat deeply, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then treat it with flour of vetches and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and swallow blood, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and bound with a cloth, and let it be aired in place until it is healed.
The treatment of cancer by cautery
When cancer appears at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the edge of the cancer.
And yet the wise say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the cancer;
and yet that does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen that happen sometimes;
and a more straightforward thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circular", as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has a disease that is called "adubelati", and it delays in maturing either because of the superfluity it causes or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say, very old) and he has little blood, or because of the weather; and you want to hasten its maturation: then cauterize it around with many small, pricking cauteries; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to mature.
And if you want to pierce it with the whole cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And place your hand in the middle of that illness which is called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it outwardly in such a way that the course of the putrefaction is lightened.
Afterwards cure it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness which is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than an eating away of a limb, for it eats the limbs like fire eats dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can endure cautery with fire, then heat the cautery irons, small and large, according to what is needed for the place where the illness is;
after cauterizing on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupt is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply to the cauterized places crushed sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
Afterwards, treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good;
and if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places.
And this affliction has sometimes been cured with a liquid medicine in place of fire cautery;
but nevertheless fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the treatment with liquid medicine in the section: take it when you need it.
of the swellings that come on the feet Very often it happens that on the feet a disease arises from inflammation which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large, swollen thing that injures the foot.
And the cautery for this disease is according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is that you heat a cautery iron, like a goose feather, and it should be made of good iron to the measure that it can encompass the nail from all sides, and that it has fine edges;
then put it, all hot, on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to shed pus; then make a plaster of wild mallows crushed with oil, and leave the plaster on all night, and the nail will fall and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the place with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if they are inverted on the outside of the body, and this often happens in the hands and feet, then you must apply a hot water cautery; and it is in this manner: take a chain of brass or iron, or a goose feather, and put it on the nail and the althelul, that is to say warts; and put the chain on so that it encompasses it entirely, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand well, and press your hand turning so that the edge of the chain reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a way deep to the root;
and let the patient suffer the burning of the hot water a little for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will be completely uprooted with all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you have eradicated all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from coldness of the nerves, or from a quartan fever or other, you must make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with the olive cautery;
then the trembling will cease, and the healing of the cold illness will be hastened.
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body boils, or foul pustules, which come from large corrupted matters.
then it is necessary, when they appear, to cauterize each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, of which the point is held in the fire, or of the root of aristolochia longa, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow further, but the superfluities from which they come are broken up, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Often there is great flowing of blood from the artery which is cut in the wound which comes from a burn, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cauterization of a limb, and similar things; and it is a very difficult thing to stop.
And however when this happens to someone, quickly put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press hard until the blood is stopped under your finger, and no drop comes out anymore;
then put in the fire several olive-shaped cauteries, small and large, until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease doing this one after another until the blood is stopped;
and beware that you do not burn the nerve which is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot easily stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four methods that we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by strong ligature of thread, or by medicines applied which have the power to stop blood; and let it be tied and squeezed tightly.
He who attempts staunching by tightly binding with cloths or by applying burning things, or other similar things, will benefit little thereby.
And if this happens to someone and he does not have a mirror or medicine present, he should place his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and extend it well until it is staunching above the wound and above the vein; and not move the finger, but wet it often with cold water, very cold, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stanched;
and then do what he needs to with cauteries and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter all illnesses in which it is necessary to cauterize with fire, or with burning medicine, and the occasions, and the causes, and the instruments, and the forms of cauteries;
and I have placed that chapter from head to foot, and I will proceed in this chapter by that same method so that one may more easily find what one wishes.
And before I begin this, dear son, it is necessary that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first of cauteries, and therefore greater caution is necessary.
For in the work of this chapter there is often evacuation of blood in opening a vein, and in incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die from it.
And I warn you that you do not undertake folly. For many kinds of people come for treatment. some come who are so afflicted with their illness that they die easily because of the frenzy they experience from their illness and its severity; and one should be afraid of these.
And of these there are some who give you their senses, and say: wait, I am cured"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you who have this manner, but put more trust in your honor than in your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely in that of which you are certain, and from which you can have profit and praise;
and use prognosis and indication in the treatment of your patients to which health should be directed;
and this will help you to acquire good reputation, and glory, and memory of praise.
Dearest son, May Our Lord grant you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter in sections, according to what is before in the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you need.
Know that this illness very often comes to children at birth, and when the midwife squeezes the child's head too hard;
and sometimes it comes from a hidden cause that is unknown.
And I never saw this illness except in children, and in all those whom I have seen, death hastened; and therefore it seems to me better to leave the work in such cures.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled each day until it could not support it;
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered under the bone above the dura mater, between the brain and the bone;
and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you cut into the head a wide incision;
and let it be as long as two fingers, so that the moisture runs out;
and here is the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is more grown, and the abscess is larger, make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the signs that you see the sutures of the head open on each side, and the water spurts out when you press it with your hand on the inside, and this is not restored to you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, draw all the moisture out. Afterwards, clean the incisions with cloths and powders, and put wine and oil there, and leave it so until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head be bandaged evenly, and give the patient dry meat with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you look at the size of the abscess, and the collection of water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Therefore, cut where the abscess appears, and the accumulation of water, and incise it as much as you are able;
and beware that you do not cut the artery; and a flow of blood comes, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has an illness called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is old, and medical treatment is of no use, then the last resort is cautery, with this, that the two arteries will be cut.
It is necessary then, when you want to cut them, that the patient tilts his head back; then rub the place with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens his neck with the whole cloth; then look where the vein beats, and the location of one and the other are behind the ears, and are slightly raised;
then mark the places with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula on two sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the spatula under the artery and cut above it, cutting as if with two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood leaps up continuously outwards.
And if the artery is not felt, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood that should be let out is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can tolerate, and the repletion of the artery;
Then examine the wound: if there remains any point of the dura mater on the bone, cut it so that no abscess forms there, then bind the wound tightly and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of tears and the heat in the temples and old violent headaches and similar things, and it is treated by various medical treatments and none of this helps, then we bleed the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient should push back the hair from his temples, and locate the artery that appears in the temple, for it is clearly visible by its pulsation, and is only slightly concealed except in some people who are very cold;
and if it is concealed, let the patient tighten his neck with some cloths, then rub the area with some rough cloth, and wash the area with warm water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula of which this is the form: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it upwards with the forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is small, then turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it from that part according to the quantity of the two ends. For if it is not cut, the blood does not flow out completely.
And draw out six ounces of blood, down to three;
and if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that putrefaction does not occur before the healing of the wound, and excessive bleeding occurs;
then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery down to the bone until the ends are cut;
and this is the best operation, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cautery helps to dry up the humors: therefore it is of greater help for humors.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and put on well-made tents;
and when they are unbound, let it be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with tents, until it is healed;
and if the artery bleeds while you are working there, hasten to cauterize it, or fill the place with vitriol and press it with your hand so that the bleeding is stopped; and if you do not have that at hand, put your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and sprinkle the place with cold water until the bleeding stops, and it is extracted as it should be;
And there should be a finger's breadth of thickness between the two knives, and then when you have marked the two places, and you place the burning iron on until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two ends because it is not completely sealed by this cautery entirely;
and this is the form of the cautery:
and that which is milder and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery on two sides, but the sharp edges should be very thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it retains its heat less.
of tears When the tears from the eyes are descending from the veins that are above the skull of the head with fever, and no medical treatment helps, and you see the face of the patient redden, and feel in the forehead a pulsation like a tremor; and his face is tense and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and blistered by the burning of the tears, then this treatment is necessary. And the ancients called it "contused treatment," and it is that you make the patient who has this illness shave the hair that he has on his forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contused treatment," and it is that you make the patient who has this illness shave the hair that he has on his forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be like two fingers wide in the middle of the forehead extending downwards to the nose, and the other two at the two temples above the eyelids, and beware of cutting the arteries that are at the two sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the area between the two jawbones, and let each wound be the size of three fingers across joined together;
and have ready a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe away the blood, then place the sharp spatula on two parts of which this is the form:
from the incision that is towards the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the skin that is between the two incisions to all the surface that is on the bone, then do likewise from the middle incision to the other second, and then remove this spatula. then place in the first incision the instrument which is called "cultellaire", and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side it is smooth, not sharp, and this is its form:
And place the cutting side towards the raw flesh at the bottom, and the smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to what appears of the brain, and then likewise do in the middle incision to the other outside;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the place for the blood taken;
then place in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and take care that hot abscesses do not come there;
and on the third day untie the ligature, and apply a great abundance of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which one treats wounds, until it is healed.
When someone has an acute catarrh habitually, and you see the eyes watery and small, and the sight weakening, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that this matter and that catarrh does not come forth except from many veins, and the best treatment that there is, is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to raise his forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another the width of a finger. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when eating;
and when the bone is uncovered, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate the two lips of the incision and put old cotton and linen tents there; then bind over it cloths moistened in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things, which cause flesh to regenerate.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to regenerate flesh everywhere.
Of the deafness of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an animal, or a mine stone or something similar like iron; or seeds, such as lentils, beans, peas; or flowing things such as water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear, nor grow in the ear, place the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, instill a little violet oil or sesame oil, then administer extraction; and make him sneeze with sneezing powder, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and extend the ear upwards.
Often strength comes through this treatment;
and if strength does not come, administer extraction with fine forceps, of which here is the form:
If it comes out with the forceps, that is good;
if not, administer extraction with a small, thin hook;
and if it does not come out by this, make a bronze chain and insert the head of the chain into the opening of the ear firmly, and plug that which is around the chain with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out forcefully, for very often it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in this manner, take birdlime, and put it on some instrument which is sharp for doing this, and put a bit of cotton around it; then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not come out by all these things that we have said, hasten to cut open the ear before a warm abscess and spasm come;
and the manner of the incision is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to the measure of his strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear by the fat or the depending part; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it as best you can, and suck it out quickly with your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin spatula according to this form: and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract it with fine tweezers and a suction cup, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.
In the water then that falls in the ear, it is necessary that the patient use sneezing powder first, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that same ear where the water is. If it jumps out because of this, it is good.
If not, take many stones, according to the length of your forefinger, small and light, and warm them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and jump on it with his feet on the other side, and strike with another stone on the stone which is in the ear; and do not cease doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out, and thus it all jumps out;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and take the other end in the fire until the greater part of the reed is burnt;
then do likewise with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said of the stone.
In the extraction of the beast, if it is small-bodied, like a flea and similar things, cure it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large-bodied that one can feel it, then administer extraction with tweezers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms lodged in the ears, when you treat it as we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and the treatment does not help, then you must look into the ear in the sun: if any worms appear there, then draw them out with fine tweezers, and if they do not appear, then take the thread of which this is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And put the finest end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly on the whole thread; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey in coming out, then stuff around the thread with cotton as I have said in the case of the stone;
and if they do not jump out as we have said, then administer distillations which the ancients have proven in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and so distil your oils and your medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And let it be of silver or bronze, narrow below with one small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside with a well-made bronze instrument for this purpose, and if you wish take a rasp and wrap cotton neatly around the point; then pour your oil or your juice, and what you wish of your medicines, into the tube, and the tube should be in the ear;
then put in the rasp with the cotton, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled or completely in the ear; and the patient feels it inside, and let the distillation be a little heated over the fire before it is distilled into the ear; and take care that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be as good.
Of the deafness of the ears
Some children are born who have no opening in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men through the obstruction of a wound, or of flesh growing inside the ear, and this obstruction sometimes goes deep into the ear, so that one cannot see it;
and sometimes the opening is slightly obstructed, and one sees it well.
That which occurs deep within, so that one cannot see it, is difficult to heal in many cases, and in that which one sees, it is necessary that you put the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction clearly, then operate with this entire spatula, of which this is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, completely smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
if the obstruction is of flesh born or of the body of the ear, then hold it with fine tweezers, and cut it lightly, until that flesh is entirely removed.
And if the obstruction is deep in the ear, then take a thin, light rasp and heat it slightly in the fire, then place it in the body of the ear.
If you feel the obstruction from which the patient feels pain in hearing, pierce lightly, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
then place in the ear a tent according to the width of the opening, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it in rosewater, and sprinkle on crushed vitriol;
and if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and insert another tent moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then treat it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, dip a sponge and cloth in cold water, and apply it to the ear, and use other treatments that stop bleeding which are in the treatment of distillations.
These styes that come on the eyelids when they are moist and dry, then you must stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut them from their roots with a spatula; then put crushed vitriol on the place.
And if blood flows out, cauterize it with a fine lenticular cautery, and cauterization after incision is useful;
and often they return, when something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of the hail Often, things appear in the eyelids that resemble hail in form and hardness, and for this reason this illness is called "hail," and is a gathering of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below; the procedure is as follows:
the procedure is as follows: observe whether the hail moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to know;
then make an incision wide, then lightly scrape each part, then grasp it with forceps, and cut it.
if you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does not harm the patient;
and if the wound is large, stitch it together, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not use force, for ointments will quickly restore it and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, invert the eyelid, and extract the hailstone with forceps, and cut and press it from one side and the other;
and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, it does no harm;
and when the hailstone is removed, wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a grease which is generated in the folds of the eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and greatly harms their eyes, and they get catarrh in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight because the tears rush to their eyes;
and therefore they lie on their faces constantly, and sleep thus, and their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, swollen and appearing covered by the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the work is that the patient puts his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains the exinach of each part, then put it on him; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a slit of the width, and let it not be greater than the wound that one makes in bloodletting;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several instances exinach comes from the slit, according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Extract it then all in one piece with a piece of lint between your fingers on the outside, and turn your hand to right and left until it is separated;
and take care that you do not insert into the slit, that you do not bring the whole spatula down to the eye, that you do not injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, slightly enlarge the slit a little until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and apply to the place, and bandage tightly.
And there are some men who grind salt and apply it to corrupt that moisture which has remained.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess appears at the place, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the testicles When hairs grow in the testicles that are unnatural and are overgrown, they harm the eyes and cause various illnesses such as habitual tearing and softening of the testicles and albuginea, to the point that it causes the destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by liquid medicine as it is explained in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suture or by cauterization, as I will explain.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head on your lap, then turn the testicle towards your left hand;
if it is turned, that is good; if not, then put a needle with a thread on it there; and let it be near the edge of the testicle where the hairs grow near those hairs, and pull the thread over the top with the testicle, and turn it back to its proper place;
then cut in the area under the testicle, under the joined hairs, with a sharp spatula, from the large tear to the small;
then pull out the thread, and put under the testicle a small tent of cotton and cloth, then draw on the testicle a figure like a vine leaf, as a myrtle leaf, and however it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity that you wish to raise the testicle that is divided in halves.
And if there is someone who needs a large quantity of the testicle to be cut according to how much the testicle is softened;
then cut with the spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear down to the small; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs in the thickness of a root, then put the onion in one of the two angles of the heart, then peel it completely;
then bring together the two lips with a stitch of a needle with a fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and cut the excess of the threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do this;
and if not, then do not worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without suture with drying and constricting substances, for the paper rises at the bottom of the wound and its closure, but the suture is better (as the ancients say), and this is a work without fear; and there is another method:
and there is another method: and it is that you cut the paper in a shape like a myrtle leaf, as we have recounted, in three separated parts according to the form which is here:
then cut what is above in small equal parts according to the form which is here:
And if you are not able to hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with one thread, and put it in the middle of the figure; and put one other thread near the large tear, and the second thread near the small one, and assemble the threads equally between your fingers;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have cut, as we have recounted, then bring together the two lips of the wound by suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, then soothe it with cerate and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the scrotum are inverted:
then you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the suture in one and the other is more skillful.
The treatment of canes is according to this form: and that is that you invert the scrotum and split it inside as I have said, and then make two canes by art, and two fine ligatures as long as the scrotum and the width of the spatula is; and cut at the two ends of the two parts where you hold the threads;
then carefully bring together the one and the other above that which protrudes from the scrotum, and tightly bind the two canes to the two parts; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin which is constricted will die and wither and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it is slow, then cut it with force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is closed, and the scrotum is raised, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the form of the two canes that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
the procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and thread it with a soft and fine silk thread; then join the ends and tie them together subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the case another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then let the patient put his head in your lap;
and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate procedure, then put the needle with the case at the root of the added hair, and make it pierce the skin quickly until you pull it over the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the case, and put that hair into the case, if there is one or two or three or more;
then remove your hand until the hairs come out with the case through the skin along with the natural hair.
And if the case is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then pull the case downwards with the thread that you have arranged there, until the case comes out of the hole above and you see it with your eyes;
then you will pull out the case and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair heals in its place and the flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is small, accompany it with a long hair from the natural hair, and let it be raised with that one or leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
of the corruption of the eye When this illness which is called "aleacrati" or corruption comes to the eye, there are two kinds:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens suddenly from a wound, or a cut, or a cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of working on it is that you split that seam, and separate the lips of it, and put inside linen tents, and bind it until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things that dry and constrict. For if you do this, the illness returns worse than before;
but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and rose water or mallow and linseed cooked, and diachylon ointment melted in some oil, and wrap a tent around it, and treat it with this.
And the key to your treatment is that you take care that it does not heal according to the form it was before;
and these operations that we have mentioned are nothing but remedies for this illness, that it may not return according to the form it was before.
This illness which is below, which is truly called "axacrati", and is natural and accidental.
The accidental [cause] comes from a wound and from a fissure and from a cautery and from similar things;
and the method of operating on it is that you take a needle, on which there is a double thread, and you stick it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out at two ends of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it with a spatula one finger-width wide. And if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good;
if not, take a rasp and put it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid, and make two incisions at the inner edge of the eyelid;
and let the ends of the two incisions be at the two corners of the incision that you have cut, and make an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter that is called "I Greek";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its edges are sharp underneath, of that which follows the eyelid, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread;
then treat it with what we have said of softening medicines, and with tents, until it is healed.
And if the ailment comes from a fissure or a suture or a cautery, then it is necessary that you make a full incision under the hairs of the eyelids, and according to what is above; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said;
then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares a device with all his might how he makes the form return to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what is needed in work and instruments in several situations.
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a way that the eyelid above is adhered to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the point of a razor under the eyelid, and lift it up;
and stretch it with pincers, until you cut what is attached with a fine spatula, which is neither too sharp nor too blunt, so that the patient cannot suffer the too sharp spatula wounding the eye;
and let your incision, with which you remove that adhesion, be light, so that the eyelid returns to its natural form;
and when that adhesion is healed, they sometimes put salt water in the eye, and wash it with fresh water, and with eyewash;
then place between the eyelid and the eye a linen tent, and put on the eye wool moistened in egg white; and after the third day use eyewash and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that a nail is according to two manners: it is nervous and similar to a hard membrane, and another which is not at all nervous, but is similar to congealed white moisture, so that when one touches it with iron and thinks to pierce it with pincers, one cannot;
and both forms begin towards the large tear duct, and grow little by little until it covers the whole sight and all the light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail with small double forceps, and stretch it upwards; then take a needle, and put on it a horsehair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and stick it into the eyelid, and pierce it with the whole needle, and tie the eyelid with a thread and stretch it upwards, and scrape with the hair the side of the eyelid that follows the pupil and the silk on the hair to the head, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with the fine spatula and small forceps, and leave the natural flesh in the tear duct, so that the body of the tears does not come by the incision as usual;
and sometimes the eyelid is stretched with the hook only, and with the thread, as we have said; then scrape it with the smooth spatula of which this is the form:
And take care that the spatula does not touch the fleshy membrane and break it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, drop into the eye a little crushed celery, and of the collyrium made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it as needed until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert the needle, and the hook cannot enter, this type of nail is often cured by medicines;
and grow as I have recounted in the division, and if you see it needs cutting, open the patient's eye, and take a light, slightly sharp spatula according to this form: And scrape the nail thinly, and if you see that it diminishes and the scraping presses it, then distil from your mouth into the eye a collyrium made of litharge and red collyrium and crushed celery, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing is hindering you in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first cure the hot abscess until it is healed, then recommence the work as before, until it is healed.
then recommence the other work according to this same method, until it is all removed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct hinders the eye by great annoyance, then lift it with a hook, and cut a part of it and not all, so that the tear duct is not affected;
then distil into the eye red collyrium which is made of litharge.
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows, and covers the pupil and encroaches upon the eyelids and turns them outwards, and resembles a pomegranate flower;
and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and you pull all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it firmly;
then cut the first layer of flesh, and keep cutting with a razor to the end, and be careful that you do not injure the eye during the procedure;
and let the incision be with the spatula that we mentioned in the incision of the nail and with small instruments with which one removes the sebaceous matter, as the illustration after this chapter shows;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, apply crushed dog's fat or distil red copperas and similar corrosive medicines onto it, and put cotton over the eye with egg white, so that it is secure from hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and hot blood overwhelms you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
then return to your work until it is healed, and do so as often as flesh is added to the eye in this way.
But nevertheless, it is necessary that you ease the treatment of each weak eye by natural means; and by accidental means, with iron instruments;
and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the limb is tolerant of that operation.
There are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they impede its function and weaken the eye always.
It is necessary then first that you see if the eye, in which the redness is, is strong, and there is no other illness except the redness; then treat it in this manner:
instruct the patient to put his head in your lap, then press those veins with the unguent according to your skill, and let the unguent be subtly doubled according to this form:
And let there be two unguents by degrees in one body according to this form:
then one treats forcefully those veins subtly, and the blood flows hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye;
and take care that you do not injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very fervent in your work so that you cut only those veins;
and when you have done this, then instill in the eye green and red gall to corrupt that which remains of the pus.
And if you are not able to collect all the pus at that time, then make a plaster over the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for a few days until the pain is eased and the hot abscess is assured, then begin again in this manner which is before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the treatment:
The Arabs call a fistula "arissati":
When you treat it with cautery and with burning medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, then it is necessary that you incise above the abscess, there where it should mature, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and the blackness, then scrape it all with the instrument of which this is the form;
and it is called "rough head", and it should be made of iron with a round head, and should be pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the site of the corrupt bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that that corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the bone is healed, and it remains so for forty days, and it does not renew itself and is not abscessed, and no bad accident comes to it, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other means than to return the fistula to the hole of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered then take a drill according to this form, and let the head of iron have three angles, and the shaft be tapered to the point as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the drill completely until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, then the matter goes to the nose; it is easier for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open and there is no obstruction or narrowing of the nose, you must bind the patient;
then cleanse it, then apply cupping glasses or scarification without wounding to draw out the humour, then apply to the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and then bandage the eye, and plaster it with bandages and cloths;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take sufficiently soft cloths, and fold each one into four, and then place one on top of the other according to the amount the eye needs;
then bandage it tightly on top with a firm bandage, and repeat the cupping to draw out the humour without wounding;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night, and if the liniment softens, you must bandage it very tightly;
then remove the liniment after a day and a night, and if you see the eye recovering, it is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster and the cloths and the liniment and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
Of the rupture of the uvula When a rupture occurs in the uvula, then it opens, and there comes forth matter like grains of resin, and it is frightening to see;
then if you see it split, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the lower part up to the upper part, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear; and pierce it there, and leave the first needle in place;
then cut the doubled thread and tie a part of the uvula around it, and pull it tight, then remove the needle and apply wool moistened in egg white;
and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvula, then treat the wound with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is restrained by the uvula on all sides by a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows a great swelling, pierce it with a fine spatula that goes deep into the eye, and the albuminous moisture will run out and the eye will descend, and will go in immediately;
then remove it until it is healed.
This illness which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling which gathers in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not water;
and the manner of the procedure is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on two sides, and move it until you see the swelling come to the top before your eyes; then let it be inserted, and let the light not descend and be obstructed, and let the patient see things as he was accustomed;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the swelling is not prepared as we have said.
Then make the patient sit between your hands, then take the fine spatula and pierce the corneal membrane a little by continuing the conjunctiva with the corneal membrane and the cornea, until the swelling comes out;
and when it is out, distill into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then let it be treated with another treatment until it is healed.
of the waters of the eye We have now the similarities of the waters in the division, and what is necessary for piercing; then work according to the health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and squeeze it very tightly;
then place the eyelid on your left hand if the eye is left, or on your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument next to the cornea by the thickness of a hair in that white of the eye at the part of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" skillfully, and twist your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty space;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's path be at the depth of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that membrane because of the clarity of the corneal membrane, and then place the instrument to the place where the water is, then press it out one way after another.
if the water descends immediately, the patient sees in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
Afterwards, rest a little, and if the water rises the second way, apply force with the instrument, and when it is fixed inside and it does not rise, then extract the almagda lightly by turning your hand little by little;
and then put back in water a little rock salt, and bathe the eye in it. Then put on the outside of the eye tampons or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind with a healthy eye.
We, and those who are of our time, apply crushed cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then you must take the instrument which is called "alberit", of which this is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and upon completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable sleeping position, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and be free from all movement, and eat light foods, and do not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in that same dark room, and test his sight, and make him see some things, and then put the bandage back on until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary that you do this at the time of treatment or immediately after the incision, but you must delay this, because the water rises quickly.
If a warm abscess appears, you should unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with something that soothes the abscess;
and when it is calmed, unbind the sight and put on his face a small bandage to cover it for a few days, and let him always be in that dark room.
And then let him go out of the house little by little, and return to his affairs;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And someone came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made almond perciet, from which one sucks the water, but I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the resemblances of the forms of almonds, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and they should be properly of bronze: And let their heads be of this same subtlety, and the rear end in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various added fleshy growths arise on the nose, of which some resemble scorpions with many feet;
and there are some where there is cancerous flesh of a dark color, and there is soft flesh of good color. In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not cancerous, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands against the sun;
In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not cancerous, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands against the sun; and open his nostrils, and throw the onion on those fleshes, and pull them out; then cut what you can hold with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that that flesh is all removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, then open it with all the subtle instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if blood overwhelms you, or a hot abscess, then help it as is necessary;
and if it is malignant abscesses, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then pour in vinegar and water or wine. If the nose works, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that he is healed;
and if moisture does not flow as it should, know that there is dead flesh on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
then you must put in a somewhat thick linen thread, and it should be knotted by hand, and have between each knot the space of a finger or less; and let the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as much as possible, and pull it gently until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and often children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it;
then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other, sawing at the knots which are on the thread.
Do this until you see that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
do this three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh;
and then put in the nose a lead cannula for some days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, then use them;
and this is the form of the instrument to purge the head, with which one distills oils and medicines into the nose:
And let it be of silver or bronze, similar to an open lamp, like a cannula, and the conduit also;
and if you wish, make a closed cannula, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and have a handle at the head to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh on the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" arises on the bridge of the nose, and grows and becomes large continually, until it is a frightening thing to behold;
and therefore it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning, and remove it entirely, then apply the cautery or burning medicine to the place;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take care if it is hard, of a livid color, and insensitive:
then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not livid in color, and you see that it can be entirely cut, then empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the place with drying and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilaginous works, it benefits little, except in some men.
It is necessary then, when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, it is necessary that you scrape all the parts of their edges until they bleed, then join the two lips with a suture, and bind it, and sprinkle on dragon's blood powder, and ground incense; and put on the powders a piece of strong plaster or other soldering plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The manner of the suture is that you join the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the suture of the belly; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of the abscesses of the lips
In many men there occurs within the lips a hard abscess, similar to vesicles, both smaller and larger;
then you must turn back the lips, and make an incision on each side, and take it with pincers and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with drying things until it is healed.
Often there grows upon the gums added flesh, which the ancients call "albulus";
then you must hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the blood or pus run;
then put on the place crushed vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: then it will not return after the cautery;
Sometimes there are gathered at the head of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, rough and unpleasant crusts; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and worm-eaten, until the corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
then you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head should be on your lap, and clean the teeth or the crusts that appear, until nothing remains; and so do with the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and the other stains, until they are cleaned;
and if one removes what is there at the first scraping, it is good; if not, then begin again the second and third day, until you have cleaned everything;
and know that the teeth need various forms of instruments for cleaning, according to what the work shows, because the scrapers with which one cleans outside the teeth have different shapes than those with which one cleans between the teeth; and these and other forms should be prepared with you.
It is necessary when you treat the toothache that you delay extraction as long as you can, for one should not do this; for it is a very high substance until one has no excuse for scraping.
Then when the patient is compelled to extraction, it is necessary that you be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in the healthy tooth, and has the good tooth extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of that, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this done by these wise men;
and when you are certain of the aching tooth, it is necessary that you scrape around the tooth with a very strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly attach the forceps; and let the head of the patient be on your lap between your knees, and hold it well so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out easily, take one of these instruments and place it inside on each side lightly, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, it is necessary that you fill it with rags, where the holes are; and extract it carefully with forceps, so that it does not break during extraction;
and it is necessary to work very wisely around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And take great care that you do not break it, and that a part remains, and that greater pain than the first returns to the patient because of the malice of the root.
And beware that you do not do as ignorant surgeons do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the tooth, and do not achieve what we have described;
but sometimes cause great illness through the infection from the roots that remain, or from the tooth they break, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is drawn, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, apply crushed vitriol to the place;
and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments with which one first loosens the teeth should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you extract the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And they should be of thick members so that they do not bend when pulling, and they should be of well-made iron, and they should be toothed to hold firmly.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains during extraction, it is necessary that you apply cotton soaked in butter to the area for one or two days, until the area is softened, then apply the forceps called "algefri", whose head resembles a bird's beak;
and they should be made inside like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with all these forceps, it is necessary that you uncover the flesh all around the root, and put there the instrument which is called "althali," that is to say, a lever, of which this is the shape:
And let it be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out by means of this, it is good;
if not, then help yourself with all the instruments, whose shapes come afterwards:
And one uses this instrument which has two prongs, of which this is the shape: and of other tools which are in front in the extraction of teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large forceps, of which this is the shape:
And let this instrument be strong so that it cannot break, and know that there are many instruments for teeth; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and subtle master finds his own instrument, according to what his work and the illness show him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of cases; and if one breaks a piece of the cartilage or of the other bones, or if it rots, then he looks for the instruments which are necessary, which I have told you about, and he helps himself with the gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and strong to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but that one can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with suitable medicines, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to their natural order, and the shape is ugly, and especially in young women, then you must know if the tooth is grown after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and one cannot file or grind it:
then extract it; and if it is loose with the tooth, then take this instrument of which here is the form, and it is similar to a small beak, and let it be of iron, sharp at the point:
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is apparent that one can file it, then file it with a file such as this is the form:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls;
then plane it at the end with some kind of scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it wounds the tongue, then it is necessary to file the roughness until it is even, so that it does not wound the tongue or impair speech.
When the front teeth loosen, either by percussion or by falling, and the patient cannot bite down on what he eats without pain, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and this does not help;
then it is necessary to restrain them with a gold wire, because silver wire turns green and rots, but gold never changes;
and let the wire be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the wire and double it between the two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loosened teeth, if there is one or more, until you skillfully reach a healthy tooth on the other side; then begin the wrapping again until the point where you began, and restrain your hand subtly and skillfully, so that it does not move;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the wire with pliers, and join them, and place them between the healthy tooth, and place it so that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it thus tightly as long as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the wire breaks, then tighten it with another wire;
it will remain and serve thus its entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the manner of the arrangement of the two healthy teeth, and of the two moved ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, then one puts it back in its place, again and again, as we have said;
and let no one interfere who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes a form of a tooth from cow bone, and one places it in the place where it is lacking, and one tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus a long time.
Sometimes this ligament, which comes from under the tongue, is natural, that one is born thus; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and have his head in your lap, and lift his tongue;
then cut the nervous ligament broadly, so that the tongue is released from its constraint, and if there is hardness or a knot, and this is suddenly from a wound, then put the hook there and cut broadly that ligament;
and beware that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery which is underneath;
and when you have done, lift the area with rose water and vinegar, or with cold water, then place under the tongue a linen tent;
and let the patient dress it each night, so that the area does not become stuck together.
And if bleeding occurs, put crushed vitriol on the area; and if the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it with the lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with another treatment until it is healed,
and if you see it of a livid color or black or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is cancer;
and if it is tending towards a whitlow, and there is moisture, pour on onion juice, and lance it with a fine spatula, and release it on one side and the other; and if the bleeding overcomes you in your work, apply crushed vitriol until it is stanched, then return to your work until you have removed all the pus;
then clean the place with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of the abscesses of the throat Sometimes there come boils inside the throat which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, take care:
if this abscess is hard, small, and of a dark color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the flow of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will break by itself;
and if it is of a whitish-red color, and the root is thin, have the instrument prepared for cutting, but first see if the hot abscess has calmed and subsided.
Then make the patient sit before the sun, and his head should be in your lap, and he opens his mouth and the assistant takes it between his hands, and presses the tongue down with the instrument, of which this is the shape;
and let it be of silver or of thin bronze like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out upwards as much as you can;
and pull out some of the membranes with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the shape, which resembles small scissors; and the ends are curved, and one opposite the other, and they are very sharp, and it is made of Indian iron or bronze:
And if you do not have this instrument at hand, then cut it with pliers, of which this is the shape: And let it be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision have the patient gargle with warm water, and water and vinegar, and if bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate bark has been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two tonsils, then cut them in the same way as the two tonsils.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat, that is to say, a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed off her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained so for one or two days.
And the abscess had swollen so much that it had pushed out two roots through the two nostrils.
I hastened then at once, and inserted a hook into one, then pulled it out, and pulled out a large portion of pus;
then I did likewise in the other nostril, and I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the hook into the abscess, and cut a part of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease to cut the abscess for a long time;
and the abscess grew again, and filled the place that I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
of the grape
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is swollen and round underneath, it is called "uvula".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the heat of the abscess is subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and that which is round, gathered, and not long; and it is bloody or of dark color or black, then you must avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner that I have said, of its whiteness and length, you must make the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention above; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And you must not cut more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you injure the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient fears the cutting, then you must use a method of cauterization so that he feels no fear.
And the manner of cautery is with sharp water. And it is that the patient should put his head in your lap, and then press his tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize it with lukewarm, living water, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and use the end of this instrument, of which here is the form:
And it has on the head a cavity where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and puts the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula;
and the patient should be lying on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run from his mouth away from the medicine, so that it does not descend to the throat and injure it;
then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula, the amount of half an hour, until you see it wither and the burning from the medicine is subsided;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton into the mouth above, until the cotton touches the uvula;
and do this often, until the cautery is complete, then let it dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to repeat the cautery with the medicine, then repeat it, and after the cautery wipe around the uvula with cotton dipped in butter, and cleanse what is around the medicine;
and let it be sprinkled with cold water, and let it be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, or than cautery;
if it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and origanum and rue and chamomile and vervain and similar herbs, and mix all or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and bring to a boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong earth, and inside the pot have a perforated instrument in this manner: And let it be of silver or bronze, and let one of the ends be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the throat, until the uvula is anesthetized;
afterwards repeat it often, until the uvula is dry, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the onset of the hot abscess, for several things happen there; and not to do this except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a tube and put inside its head an eggshell, so that the patient's mouth does not get too hot; for the eggshell does not allow the vapor to harm the mouth, and this is a good treatment together with healing.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or something else, gets stuck in the throat;
then you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue down with the instrument, so that you can see the thing move;
and what does not appear and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; by chance the thing will come out backwards through vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it comes to the place, it will stick, and then pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take a lead instrument according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head lifted up; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest a cough comes to him, nor push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient puts in the instrument, because he knows better where the thing is stuck; then push it down, or pull it out with the instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech from the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the treatment of medicines; and when that does not help, then look in the patient's throat in the sun, then press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps that are suitable for this.
And if that doesn't work, take a horsehair, and put it in the patient's throat, then put a hot iron on the end of the hair, and do this often. And let the patient drink water all day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with your hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, fumigate the patient with asafoetida, with the instrument that I described in the fumigation of the uvula;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals, and the pot is covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole is the end of the instrument;
then throw your fumigation in, and the patient puts the end of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and pungent things, and do not drink water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out forcefully by this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one pulls out the leech, when one can see it, is similar to curved tongs to enter the throat; and it resembles a bird's beak, and has a rough surface like a file, so that what it grasps, it cannot let go;
Many kinds of abscesses exist, according to what is remembered later in this book, and they differ in perforation and size;
and this is in two ways, one being in its very appearance, and what it contains of moisture.
And the second way is because of the places where they are in the body.
For abscesses of the head are different from those of the fundament, and abscesses of fleshy places are different from those that occur in joints, and each has its own judgment in treatment.
And there are abscesses that one should not pierce until the swelling is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that it is necessary to pierce when they are grown, and do not ripen according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near joints.
For when an abscess occurs near the joints, and it is left until it is rotten around, by chance the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Or, if the abscess is near the principal member, and you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the principal member;
or if it is near the fundament, one pierces it before it is ripe;
and it is not necessary that you pierce an unripe abscess without completed digestion, except that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply and become extended inward, and a fistula develops there; and cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time for the perforation of the ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is lessened, and the fever departs, and the reduction of pain and redness, and of the throbbing and sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and it is necessary that you make the perforation in the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears to move;
and let the perforation be along the length of the body, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints and near nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no bending. In those that bend, along that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you leave the perforation until it is confirmed in completed digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be spread from it, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the lips and depths of it will harden.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small holes in small abscesses; and in large abscesses, large holes, and many slits according to the likeness of the size of the abscess;
and there are such abscesses where it is necessary to reach the core, and to cut; when it has become like a rag, and is dead, it is necessary to do as one does with buboes:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some which one cuts like a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the groin;
and there are some where one makes a round cut, and other cuts and similar incisions.
Those which have no head, like a soft superficial abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected much matter, and you pierce it, not to draw out all the matter at that time, but to draw out a part; then stuff the abscess until the next day, then draw out something again; do this many times gradually, until all the matter comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit man. For the spirit sometimes leaps with the exit of the matter, so that by chance the patient dies, and you are not to blame.
Therefore perform this chapter with great caution, and when you have perceived your abscess, cleanse the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a full incision, apply tents of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, you must put a tent in each so that they meet each other;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have shaved it around, you must fill it with old cotton or linen cloth shavings without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs in your work, apply cold water and vinegar, and wet a cloth, and apply it to the bleeding area many times.
And if the bleeding persists, administer treatment and care, and the powders that I have mentioned in other places in this book, and if it is winter, and the place where the abscess is is very sensitive, then you must apply tents and cloths soaked in hot wine and oil;
and if it is summer, and the area is fleshy, then you must apply cloths soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then open the abscess and clean it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in the treatment of abscesses:
I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
In the scalp come small abscesses, and there are kinds that are in clusters, like the yolk of an egg, and there are many similar ones.
There are fatty ones and those where there is moisture, like pus;
and there are some that are hard and stony to the touch, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of incision is that you probe with the instrument that is called an "introducer", of which the form comes later, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then lance it from above lengthwise.
And when the moisture is emptied, scrape it clean without leaving anything of the skin that contains that moisture, for it returns always when one leaves something there;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; and this will draw out what remains of the night.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, the second day, and the third, until you know well that nothing remains of the night;
then treat the wound with a suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains thick matter, cut it lengthwise, according to this form; and put in your ointments, and scrape it on all sides, and apply all your care to draw out the matter where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you afterwards.
And do the same with an abscess if it is stony, and in cutting and cleaning it as I have told you.
And cutting into a stony and moist abscess is easier, for they contain little blood. And there are some of these abscesses on the head where there is no moisture, and of these were the abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, and white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck it, one would have made a wound as well as with a stone.
In other abscesses occurring on the head, except those which come at the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, so that the pus may escape;
and treat them as is necessary.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they occur elsewhere on the body, and they are many, and are interconnected with one another.
And each scrophula is properly within its own compartment, like the nut and the abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrophulas are many.
and the appearances of these scrophulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not wish to obey health.
In that one then which you see of good disposition to the touch, and is similar in color to the body, and moves on every side and is not close to the nerves of the neck or to the artery or to the duct, and is not deep;
then you must cut it from above, and scrape it from each part, and extend the two lips of the wound with hooks, if you need to, as we have said in abscesses of the head;
and draw it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let the spatula not be sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far, lest you cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and that does not allow you to work, then put in the wound crushed vitriol, or some powders that staunch blood, and bind the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to fester.
And when the blood is stanched, then return to your work, until you complete it;
then seek with your index finger if there remain any small scrofulous swellings, cut and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, it is not necessary to cut that scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong doubled thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then dress it.
And if you cut away the whole scrofula, you must bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, provided that there is no remaining superfluity because of the size of the scrofula. then you must be careful to cut its root and pull it out, and sew it as we have said.
then you must be careful to cut its root and pull it out, and sew it as we have said. Those scrofulas that contain superfluity, pierce them where they appear ripe;
and pierce it like the one previously described, hanging down, then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it consumes what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the incision of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the fissure of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be excised; and that one not do it in this way, because all the veins and the lung of the patient are close to those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat or in the two tonsils.
When the illness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the death that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we want to cut the epiglottis, we should cut it below three or four circles a small fissure across, between the two circles or by the amount of the fissure of the tonsil, not in the cartilage;
and that place is so suitable for the section of the epiglottis that there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far away.
And if the master is fearful, it is necessary that he stretch the skin of the throat with the whole finger, then cut the skin until he reaches the channel; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the tonsil, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the section of the phlegm of the channel which leaps out through the place which is broken, and by the loss of the voice;
and leave the wound open a while.
And when the hour has passed of which one fears strangulation, bring together the two lips of the wound of the throat, and sew it all alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely swollen, and the patient is judged to be dying, and the breath fails. Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this reason the ancients ordered leaving the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they ordered sewing the wound and curing it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife and plunged it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the lung;
and I was called to cure her, and found her as good as dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood which had flowed from it, and I knew well that she had not cut a vein or duct except the throat, and the wind issued forth through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and nothing happened to the young lady except that she was hoarse, and afterwards returned to her normal state;
therefore I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no need for fear.
This abscess is called a "hernia of the throat", and is a large abscess the color of a yolk, and is very common in women;
and is of two kinds: natural, and accidental;
or the natural one has no remedy.
And the accidental one is of two kinds, of which one resembles fat to us, and the other kind resembles an abscess that comes from an artery to us; and there is fear, and it is not necessary to work with hot irons except in that which is small, and prove and search it with the whole probe: if you find it like a nut of fat, and it does not adhere to any vein, cut it, as one cuts nuts, and pull it out with its shell, if there is any; and search well all around, and cure it as is necessary, until it is perfectly healed.
Many kinds of nuts there are, of which I will describe all the similarities;
And now it is necessary that I tell all the difference which is between a nut and an issue.
I say that an issue is heat and persistent fever, until the boiling is past, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and the heat subside.
With the nut there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains pus, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a blister, and becomes large;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy, or moist, and many are in color as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of the nut, that you first examine it with the instrument which is called "introducer," according to what its form will be in the chapter which follows.
And the manner of the examination of the abscesses of the nuts is that you take the most moist place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then that it should be according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the introducer, and take care that pus comes out.
If running moisture is present, note what color it is, and treat it as I have said of the other abscesses;
and if after the introducer no moisture comes, know that it is fatty, so treat it then in a cross shape, and take it with pincers, and lightly scrape it from each side and guard the sac in which it lies so that you extract it whole with the nut;
and if you cannot extract it whole, then extract it in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the nut returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and clean the wound, and apply soothing things to the hot abscess, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the nut is large, sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which engenders flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary to you or another, hasten and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and leave it there two or three days, until the wound festers, and the boiling of the blood rests; then return to cut away what remains of the nut.
Here are the forms of the instruments used, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small;
and there are three squares which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and there are three kinds of them: large, medium, and small, for encircling abscesses of fistula;
and are like the needles with which one sews sores, and are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and those which are yellow are worth more, and are more proven with black lead for encircling the curves of fistula;
and are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the hooks are very similar, as you see here:
and there are hooks which have two curves of three kinds as well;
and there are hooks which have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are hooks which have two curves, and hooks of only one curve, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The heads of those with which one cuts are sharp, and there are some which do not cut except on one side, with which one scrapes the warts, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these introducers, the blades are enclosed in handles, so that the patient does not notice them at the opening of the abscesses;
and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them only in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in the armpits, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to a fig-tree bark, according to this form, with which one stops blood: and it is sometimes placed in the place that heals the cutting of veins, and arteries, and sometimes round according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, until they resemble the breasts of a woman;
and remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must proceed according to this form from this line b. up to g.: then remove the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then join the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops, and is softened by its size as happens to women, then cut it in two parts on top, through two similar incisions; so that one is joined to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line b. to line g.; then remove the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about sutures and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.
Those then which contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b to line g: And when all the matter that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with an ointment suitable for this until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, incise it as we have said in the incisions of scrofula, and if the wound produces matter, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is broken, and the skin above is sewn, abscesses often result, and the same happens with an inflamed vein and abscess;
and one knows it thus when it is because of the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a throbbing;
and when it is because of the vein, a swelling is clearly apparent;
and it is folly to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and neck and in many other places, and is very large. It is necessary then to avoid the iron treatment, and the one who is in charge must avoid it also, and in the one who has an arterial swelling, cut through the skin lengthwise;
then open the incision with hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is exposed;
then place a needle underneath it, and make it pierce to the other side, and draw the artery out with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then prick the area between the two ligatures with a lancet until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is emptied;
then apply the treatment that generates pus, until the ligatures fall off; then treat it with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is near the vein, you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can along with the skin, then place the needle under the area you are holding with your hand, and make it pierce, and have a double thread, so that you pull it out on the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with the ligature on either of the two sides to the two ends of the thread;
and if you fear that the threads will come out, then put another needle with a thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the first needle, and pull the threads out in four places;
then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut the excess of the core and leave that which is bound;
then put on a cloth moistened in wine and oil, then administer treatments of tents and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and in the vein, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured, or by too much work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and in many cases it is without pain;
and when it is squeezed hard, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and it moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or down or up, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with iron: by chance, contraction might result; and the one that is on the head or forehead, lance the skin with a spatula.
and the one that is on the head or forehead, lance the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and flay it, then remove it and bring the edges of the wound together with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens in the abdomen and nowhere else, and it is a disease which is called "fungus" because of its resemblance to them, and its roots are subtle, and its head is large;
and there are some small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly which were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had thin roots, and were cleft, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them and found one weighing eighteen ounces, and the other six and a half, and the procedure in the incision is that you observe if the patient is moist, and the color of the lump is white and moist and of subtle roots; if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery ready.
if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery ready. For in cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead thread, and tie the lump with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the lump, and it falls off by itself without effort;
and if the roots are large, there is fear in cutting it especially for the belly, but you can well cut half, then cauterize it so that it does not return;
then cure the wound, and be careful not to cut the little lump which is of a pale color and of little feeling and of milky appearance.
For this is a festering abscess, and I will come to the treatment of festering sores afterwards.
when the boil bursts forth If the appearance of the boil comes from a cauterized wound or a fissure of a fistula, and is on the belly and some boils appear from it, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from flatulence;
and if it is by the rupture of the fistula and by the exit of the bowel, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and opens with diverse discharge. And if it is due to the discharge from the intestine, then it is more varied, and when one presses it with one's fingers it retracts, and then returns, and perhaps it is scarred, and grows much larger at the entrance to the bath and through hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and opens well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrict.
And if it is due to blood, then the abscesses appear large and hard through these signs, and are fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you observe whether the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence.
and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you observe whether the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, because of the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath, and lie stretched out straight, then bleed him all around the buttock; then instruct him to lie often between your hands, then go around the area you have marked with the entire spatula, then extend half of the abscess upwards with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the ligature be secure;
then open the half of the abscess extended above the ligature, and put your index finger there, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the ligature, then untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the hook, and cut away the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, then carefully go around it, then return to your work and take two needles, and thread two strong threads, and place the two needles around what you have done in a cross, that you make pierce;
then tie the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it festers, and the dead flesh falls away by itself; or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and finish the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and finish the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as necessary, and close the wound.
Of the cancer We have spoken in the division of the similarities of cancer, and how one should work on it with medicines, and how one should avoid the iron cure;
and we say that cancer grows in the marrow, and great caution is needed in the cure, and the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where it can be excised, such as cancer that is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, and one should remove it entirely when it is in the beginning;
nor did anyone ever heal it before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile some times;
then make him bleed if he has manifest repletion, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the procedure;
then apply your ointments to the ulcer, and shave the hair from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow completely, and wipe the area well with your hand or something, and if the flow of blood prevents you from incising the artery or vein, cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
Of dropsy We have, I said in the division, the appearances of dropsy, and in what manner the collection of water is made, and the signs of each appearance, and the cure which is done by medicines, and that which is cured by iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two appearances: that is to say, tympanites and hyposphagia, for it is a mortal thing;
therefore when you treat this appearance of dropsy which is called "eclites" with medicines, and the cure does not help, then see if the patient is weak, or if he has another illness than dropsy, such as fever and diarrhea and similar things; do not touch it with iron, for there is doubt;
and if you see the patient of strong virtue, and he has no other illness than dropsy alone, and he is neither too young nor too old, then you should work thus: lift the patient straight up on your hands, and press his belly, driving the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spatula spinosa according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. sharply pointed, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestine when inserted, and injure it;
then see if the dropsy is located towards the intestines: if so, you must make three incisions above the buttocks, directly below the hip; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, let your incision be on the left of the buttocks, three fingers wide;
and if it is due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and it is not necessary that the patient lie on the incision lest the superfluities flow to that weak place;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the fascia as in flaying, to the extent of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the fascia until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the place of the water, then pull it out, and insert this instrument of which this is the shape: And it is similar to a fine silver tube, and is of light bronze or brass, and has at the lower part one small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on another;
and the head is cut like a pen, and this is the shape of the incision with which scribes cut the pen:
at the top is the handle, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it immediately descends on the instrument;
empty then half or a third part, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient dies from the dissolution of his vital spirit, or he faints, or he approaches death;
but empty according to the quantity of his strength, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's strength signify, and his pulse;
then draw the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained immediately by the heart which stops the hole which is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then restart the instrument the next day, if you see the patient suffering that, and draw out a small quantity of water;
do this every day, and take care not to be foolish until there remains only a little water.
And if you are doubtful about the patient, and you leave too much water, then treat it with a hot poultice or sand, and by much sweating or a bath and in the sun, and abstain from drinking; and treat it with drying medicines until it is healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
Then it is necessary that it be pierced immediately with a very fine spatula according to this form:
then put in the opening a thin lead tube, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days, and when he wants to urinate, let the tube be removed, and he can urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes out does not allow it to remain closed.
For one whose opening is small, it is treated with the lead tube, as we have said, so it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born who have the opening at the head of the penis, wherefore they cannot urinate unless they raise their penis upwards; and cannot reproduce because the matter cannot reach the sea, and this is a serious illness.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient lies often on his back, then they straighten the head of the penis and cut it like the shaft of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;
and beware of the bleeding which often occurs there, and if it happens, staunch it with what stanches blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Often these whitlows appear on the penis, and it is an ugly appearance of flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
it is necessary that you take them with a sharp little hook, and cut and clean them all, then put on moistened cotton with Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the whitlow is malignant, of a foul color and foul-smelling, then you must apply a cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the whitlow is on the penis, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, then you must remove the whitlow that is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it together, the head of the penis is not safe from being pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and the testicle;
it is necessary to remove all that which is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from the bark of pomegranates and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery helps with the two conditions together: that is to say, to the flow of blood, and to the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, it is necessary that you insert into the canal of the penis a lead tube, and the patient urinates through it;
and when the skin is constricted at the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or which happens due to a wound or an abscess, then it is necessary that you scrape it with a sharp instrument, until the constriction is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is a serious matter to remove this, it is necessary that you scrape it with a spatula, a little from the head of the penis and from the skin;
then separate gently the two, and place there a thin linen cloth moistened in cold water, so that it does not constrict again.
Circumcision is not a loosening of continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this operation of our own will, and properly on children, it is necessary that we perform the best operation, and the easiest for healing.
I say that the ancients did not describe the circumcision of their children, for they do not use it in their law, and we have nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the majority of masters and surgeons who performed circumcision around the glans, and forcefully, and with a whole scalpel;
the heart fled because there are two membranes, and by chance one cuts the upper one and the lower one remains. Now it must be cut, and the pain is doubled, and the cleansing which is of the glans is not assured at the tip of the member;
and in the cleansing of the foreskin, perhaps the iron slips, and the work is spoiled, and many times they are born thus that they have no need of cleansing and I have seen it.
Of the cleansing which is done forcefully with the entire thread I have found the goodness of the experiment, for the forceps cut just as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, you cut equally in one single instant; but that the thread be well drawn around the skin;
and the manner of the first operation is that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him happy in every way that you can;
then make him stand between your hands straight, and place the forceps between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand to the penis and blow on the heart, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis is inside; then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little knot to another little knot;
then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little knot to another little knot; and hold it with two fingers for the second hour at the little finger and the index finger, and cut between the two knots, then quickly lift the heart and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, for that is the best; and put powder on, and on the powder a cloth glued with a yolk of a cooked egg tempered with rose water, mixed with good and fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The form of the forces for the cleansing is this:
the two heads should be sharp and cutting, and the heads should be as large as the handle, equally:
The error of the cleansing is when the pus inside flees the incision;
then you must spread it with your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is beneath the penis is swollen, leave it until the swelling of the abscess has subsided, and lightly scrape it;
cut it as much as you can move, and guard the part of the penis, it will not harm it at all.
Then cure the place of wounds with the powders we have mentioned in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts too deeply, and it goes to the surface, it will not harm;
then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from obstruction by a stone, or congealed blood, or bowel, or raw flesh, or similar things, which we have mentioned in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone which is in or near the neck of the bladder, then the patient must be bent over his knees; and his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of the back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constrained to express the stone upwards, because of which the urine is released;
and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
and let it be of fine silver, light and hollow, like the feather of a bird; and let the tube be a palm and a half long, and let it be thin at the end.
And the manner of the urine's exit is that you take a double thread, and tie to the end a little wool or cotton, and put the end of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and put it up to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a seat, and anoint his bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the belly;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it come to the empty thing, and this is not done according to this order except because the conduit where it goes is twisted;
then pull the thread with all the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out completely, and let the urine flow;
and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When scabs or blood comes into the bladder, or corruption gathers there, and you wish to instill waters and medicines, do so with the instrument called a "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three openings: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the hollow through which the medicine flows should be such that it stops the penis well without addition, so that one can draw out the moisture, and inject when necessary;
and when you wish to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the catheter in the moisture, and draw with the tube that is inside;
then you will draw the moisture with the catheter, and then forcefully push the tube back in; then the moisture will enter, and will reach the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysterizes the bladder:
And it is of silver or of tin, and the head is higher;
and below is a container where the liquid falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you wish to clysterize the bladder, then tie it firmly between the two containers with a good double thread, and slightly heat that liquid over the fire;
then insert the tip of the clyster into the penis, then squeeze your hand on the bladder with all the liquid gently, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it roundly all around; then put a strong thread through these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put inside what you wish of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have, I said in the division, the types of stone, and their extraction along with medicines;
and I have spoken of the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stones one must operate by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you clearly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder happens more often to children, and it is a sign that the urine leaps from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety;
and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it swells many times, and then becomes stiff; and in many of these, the anus leaks;
and the healing of children is easy until they are four years old, and it is very difficult in old men, and it is moderate in young men, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have a large stone than for those who have a small one.
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the excrement that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the retrieval of the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and raise and move him about, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes protrudes from its high place;
then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards;
then seek and touch it within;
if you feel the stone in the space, hasten now to cut above the stone.
And if it does not fall completely to the touch, moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a young adult; and put it into his rectum, and seek the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press on with your finger, and push it outside where you wish to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to lift the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin that is beneath the testicles in the area where the incision is made;
then insert the cutting spatula, of which this is the form: And cut between that which is between the testicles and the rectum, not in the middle but on the side of the left buttock;
and it should be directly over the stone, and your fingers should always be at the rectum, and the incision should be transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps press with the finger which is at the rectum, so that it comes out without effort;
and know that there are some stones which have angles and edges: then it is difficult to remove;
and there are some which are smooth, similar to an acorn, and round, whose removal is easy.
Therefore, for that which has angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not come out, then you must pull on it with forceps which are like a file at the head, to move the stone so that it does not escape; or you place underneath it a thin, curved instrument at the head;
and if you cannot manage it thus, slightly widen the opening, and if the blood flows, constrict it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first place the largest at the neck of the bladder, then cut above, then pull it out forcefully, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be sawn, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine constantly leaks because the wound cannot heal;
but nevertheless strive to pull it out, or break it with forceps, until you extract it in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloes and dragon's blood, and bind it, and place over it a cloth moistened in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then support the patient on his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, rinse the area very well with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses and corrosions appear in the wound, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is thereby retained, which is known in this way that without a jump along with the urine: then put your finger in the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will flow to the bladder, and rot it;
then cleanse the wound with water and vinegar and salt, and help it in every way that you know, until it is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat it, you bind its two thighs together, and apply the medicines to the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and lodged inside, and the urine cannot come out; then treat it as I said before, that you cut it many times, and one is excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven this thus.
Take an iron drill according to this form and let it be with three angles fixed in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
then put the drill into the penis lightly, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side;
then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone which is inside the penis. Then it is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis towards the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood which is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
It happens that a stone is engendered in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three reasons:
one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a well-knowing woman who reveals herself to the physicians, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-skilled in this art nearby;
and the fourth reason is that the stone of the woman is deeper than the stone of the man, wherefore a deeper incision is necessary, and there is great fear. And if necessity demands it, then you must take a well-knowing midwife, and these are scarcely found, and if you do not find one, do not seek a chaste and subtle physician;
and present to her a wise woman skilled in the lives of women, or a woman who knows some part of the art, and instruct her to do what you instruct her concerning the examination of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin:
and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she should constrain it beneath her finger, and instruct her to place her finger in the vagina of the patient, and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, then she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it comes to the root of the thigh;
then cut above the stone at the root of the thigh towards the middle of the vagina, there where it is usually positioned, and feel for the stone in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then put the instrument into the incision; if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound so that the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and which have roots.
so know the similarities to know the outcome.
And if the blood overwhelms you, put crushed vitriol on the spot, and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I told you about in the extraction of the stone in men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overwhelms you, and it is from a severed artery, put the powder on the spot and restrain it with tents and bandages, and do not recommence this, and leave the stone and do not remove it, lest by chance the patient die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is subsided, and the place is clean, then return to your work, until the stone is removed.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white humour, which is under the skin of the testicles, which contains the egg;
and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the egg, so that one thinks that it is another egg; and that is the skin of the testicle between the white humor that we have mentioned;
and this happens rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: or it is a color tending towards jaundice, or it is without redness, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to know this gathering, for if it is in the white membrane that we have said, the abscess is round, somewhat long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because there is moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the proper tunic, the abscess is round with a part of the testicle, and therefore it is thought to be another egg;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, one feels it well;
therefore when you wish to know the color of the moisture, test it with the small, square probe, whose form is described above. According to that then which comes after the probe, judge what is inside.
And when we cure it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his ability and the repletion of his body;
then place him on his back, on something a little high, and put many cloths underneath him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart near the testicles;
then take the sharp scalpel, and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise to near the handle, and let your incision be completely straight, separating the skin of the testicles to the white fascia, and carefully remove the skin as much as possible;
then pierce the fascia full of water with one large hole, and draw out all the water, and then apply your ointments, and stretch the fascia upwards;
and do not touch the testicles themselves, but only the fascia; cut all or parts of it very finely, because if you do not cut it skillfully, the water will return;
and if a testicle jumps out during your work, put it back in place when you have completed the work on the fascia;
then join the two lips of the scrotum with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another disease, you must tie the suspensory vessels, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if pus is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two abscesses; then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and put outside other wool soaked in wine and oil, and put it over the two testicles, and put over it doubled cloths, and bind it all with a bandage which is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with lint according to this likeness and let them be joined by stitching at the opening of the breeches, and one of the ends should go over the buttocks to the back, and the other to the part of the groin;
and the other two ends over the two groins, and let the whole bandage be gathered in the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this testicle is treated with cautery instead of an iron incision, and it is that you take a thin knife-shaped cauterizer, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white tunic which contains the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that tunic with it, and scrape it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in every way that you can, until you have removed it all;
and take care that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this operation is safer; and less prone to bleeding, and gentler than cutting operations;
and if anything goes wrong, whether abscess, bleeding or something else, treat that which is wrong, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to undergo this operation because of its horror, then administer perforation, as I tell you, and that is when you are quite certain by the signs that we have described that watery humor is present, make the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with a spatula as wide as possible, and make the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the water may flow out;
then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and let the remaining water drain, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the water to escape from the mouth of the wound, then you must insert a feather or the instrument with which one draws water from the dropsical, whose shape is described above;
and slightly enlarge the wound, and know that the water returns and collects after six months or thereabouts, and when it has collected as before, and thus the patient will spend his days.
Know that in the incision of this branch there is fear in many situations, wherefore it seems to me better that it be left;
and I will tell you the procedure and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come on the body, and especially to the testicles; and that is in many cases.
That is to know by an excess of sour and sharp humor, which is spread to the testicles, or from percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and finds no pain, and is a serious abscess;
and perhaps there are serious, painful and suppurative abscesses, and of a livid color, and sometimes comes from a ruptured artery, or from vein swelling.
When it is from a ruptured artery, it is known by the disposition of a hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you must not touch it.
That which is made from vein swelling is known by its disposition on expression from the touch of the fingers, and one can well make an incision on this sort, and on the other fleshy parts; and it is that you cut the heart of the testicles, then extend the testicle upward, and draw the white membrane strongly, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is already soldered with the neighboring flesh, then it is necessary that you draw out the testicle, and cut it;
and if it is attached to the membrane, or in that which is within the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that membrane, and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the flesh is in the posterior location, then it is necessary that you cut it all, and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool moistened in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped in an envelope similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
and the treatment of this disease is almost as frightening as the one before, and yet we will tell you the procedure, according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the suspensory of the testicles down to your fingers, with all the vessels that are close to the penis, and let the master hold them, and stretch them strongly;
then cut with a wide, sharp spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then scrape on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;
then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the pus came, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, along the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted humors;
then treat the wound like the others where you apply a bandage, so that no vessel is cut that nourishes one of the testicles;
for by this no harm comes, and if pus comes to all the vessels, then it is necessary to draw out the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this hernia is by the section that occurs in the peritoneum, or the distension on the belly in the groin area, because of which the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the peritoneum, or of its distension, and these two manners come from many causes:
from percussion, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy weight, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the distension of the peritoneum, is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscesses are even to the depths, because the peritoneum presses on the intestines.
And the sign is, when it is from the section of the peritoneum, that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscesses are diversely apparent, under the skin, and this is because of the issue of the intestine and the body outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the intestines descend with the intestine, and are retained within, and cause the patient to suffer great pain, especially when pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, wherefore it is necessary to avoid them.
And the manner of the work is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand into the wound, if he can return it there; then let it be supported on its neck, between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then extend the scrotum upwards, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then place inside the lips of the wound hooks according to what you need to open the wound, and let it be such that the egg can come out;
then flay the fascia which is under the skin of the testicles, until the hard white fascia is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which surrounds the testicle, into that which is between the white fascia which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second fascia, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second fascia;
and then move your right hand inside the scrotum, and stretch the white fascia upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with all the fascia towards the groin; and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards, and loosen that which is behind the binding;
and search with your fingers if there is any intestine wrapped in the hard white fascia, and if you find anything, then put it back into the abdomen below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads, and put it into the back part of the fascia, which is behind the skin of the scrotum; after the groin, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and bind the fascia, which we have said is under the skin of the scrotum, with a strong ligature on two sides; then wrap the ends of the threads, and bind them firmly on two sides, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter, so that no abscess forms there; and put the ligature again according to the first ligature, two fingerbreadths from it, and after these two ligatures leave of the fascia which is under the skin of the scrotum the width of a finger; and afterwards all the rest according to the roundness that the testicle has;
then cut in the part which is under the skin of the scrotum, until the blood flows, and the bowel, as we have said before;
then apply wool moistened in oil, and place it on the wound, and apply the ligature that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white fascia that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, let it be rinsed with warm water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is perfectly healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this branch I never saw anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is made like the branch which is around the viscera, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after the incision above or slightly below;
then cut it in half, and treat the abscess with what works, until the vessels heal;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the angles, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the scrotum, and if any do descend, it is little, and returns every hour;
and however, if it remains too long at this point, the wound or the hernia grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens because of the extension of the hernia which is at the angles, as we have said, for it is extended, then the place is softened and swollen and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture lengthwise according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then extract the hernia which is under the skin that follows it, then take the root and put it on the apparent place of the hernia;
and press it to the depth of the belly, then sew the two apparent places of the hernia over the head of the root, and sew one and the other;
then pull out the head of the root, and do not cut the hernia nor stretch the egg or anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then cure it by the treatment of wounds.
then cure it by the treatment of wounds. And when you cut the threads, cleanse and treat the wound until it is healed.
The hernia is constricted, and has no appearance in the rupture, and cautery is gentler in this place, and nearer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is ugly to see;
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one makes the patient lie on his back, and cut the softened skin on the natural skin;
then bring together the two edges with a suture, and if you wish, first sew the superfluity of the softened skin with three or four stitches firmly;
then cut between the stitches, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the thread comes out.
Of the castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the surgeon knows how to answer when asked, and knows the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate certain animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by traction, or by incision.
In that which we do by traction, we make the animal sit in warm water until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand until they are retracted and you no longer feel them.
Of castration by incision: you must hold the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut each testicle with one cut, when you have properly skinned them;
and leave some of the tunica vaginalis and the thin membrane that is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by traction, because with traction, by chance, some part of the testicles may remain, wherefore the animal desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
Of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the figure of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and they have above the vulva something like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure of the man and of the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and cure it like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men from whom urine leaks through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tentigo is a flesh added to the natural part, so that it is too ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the cure.
You must hold the superfluity of the tentigo in your hand or with tweezers, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest a flow of blood come, then cure it with another cure until it is healed;
and to another flesh that grows at the mouth of the mare, and fills it, and perhaps jumps out, and is like a wart, and for this reason the ancients called it "wart disease". Then you must cut it, as we have said of the tentigo, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic is when the woman's nature is not whole, or the opening is small; and is by nature at birth, or by accident through a disease that has come upon it;
and is by nature at birth, or by accident through a disease that has come upon it; or it is by added flesh, or by subtle or thick scar tissue, and is formed deeply in the womb, or at the sides, or underneath, or wherever it may be;
and prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps the having of menses;
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the vulva.
If the stoppage is near the surface, seek it with your fingers or a probe.
If it is of subtle scar tissue, and it is near the two lips, hasten, and break it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and the woman should be on her back, her legs spread;
then stretch the two lips widely, until the subtle scar tissue is broken, and the stoppage is opened;
then take wool, and moisten it in oil, and place it on the spot, and let the woman and man lie together each day, so that it may not heal.
And if the scar tissue is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If the blockage is of newly formed flesh, then suspend it with a hook and cut it;
and have styptic medicines ready, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, mixed with egg white;
then apply a wide lead plate, so that the wound cannot heal;
and so it should be for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen;
then it should be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
And when in the wound, new flesh grows, then it must be cut according to this method, unless it is an infected abscess. For an infected abscess which is in the wound, one should not touch with fire.
of the hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood usually flows, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become swollen;
and we have already spoken in the division of the similarities of these, and the signs, and I will say here those which receive cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and swelling, when they are deep in the wound, and do not appear to the touch, are not cured by iron.
Those which are at the opening of the wound, which one can feel, are those which one can cure.
It is necessary then that you place the woman in a cold house, then seize the swelling with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle on medicines that restrain blood, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things;
then put her feet to the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if profuse bleeding occurs, make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate rind and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster of it and apply it to her back.
And if it stops, it is good. If not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts without cutting;
then take wool, and moisten it in plantain juice or agrimony juice with old wine, and apply it to the place.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and is similar to a rough head, so it must be cut as I have described the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses arise in the sea, such as cancer and stony abscess and herpes and esthiomenes and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and many other diseases that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary then that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which arises in the sea, which is not of the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you wish to know the work of iron, see if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Then do not hasten to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is appeased;
and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats on which he leans, and rests on his back and brings his feet together at the outer parts of the leg;
and let his thighs be spread, and place his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good binding;
then suck him towards the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the abscess, of which the form comes later;
and it is necessary that when you wish to administer this instrument, that you first insert a probe to know the depth of the abscess, so that that which enters the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, it is necessary to cover the depth of the abscess with cloths, so that the instrument does not harm it;
and it is necessary that he place the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess opens, and one opens it with a soft hand, then it is necessary to cut it at the head, at the spatula-like part;
and when the swelling is emptied, it is necessary that you put in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dried green oil;
and put the tent deep into the abscess, and put outside the abscess and on the wound clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been cooked;
then cure it after two days with an ointment suitable for this, until it is healed;
and sometimes one cleans the abscess and the wound with an enema of water and honey, and then of water in which lily roots and long birthwort have been cooked; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep in the abscess, then you must be careful not to use a hot iron, but treat it as we have said in the section.
of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife that she know the form of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing downwards, and desiring to defecate:
then the child hastens to come out; then know that that childbirth is according to the natural form, and the exit is head-first, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, it is necessary to press lightly on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends head-first, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the mother is cleansed of her superfluities by good cleansing;
and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For sometimes it comes feet-first, and the body or the head and the hands come forth, or it comes on its belly, or sideways, and is perhaps turned over on its neck, and in other bad positions;
so it is necessary for the midwife that she be wise and subtle in these things, and beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one ought to help her.
If the child comes head-first by natural issue, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, then make her sit on a saddle, where the women hold her;
and apply to her the juice of oil or fenugreek that has been cooked, and then the midwife puts between her fingers the small spatula of which this is the form: and splits the secundine, and cuts with her nail until the moisture that is inside runs out;
and takes the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with linseed oil;
then make her sneeze and cough with a potion, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will come out immediately.
And if the two hands come out, then you must gently put them back little by little; and if they cannot enter, then put the woman on a seat, and raise her feet; then stand the seat on the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall when it is stood up;
and if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife which is mentioned above, and extract the child, and reposition equally.
of the delivery of the child on its feet When the child comes on its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards; and then turn it little by little, until it is even;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it comes down to the thighs, then instruct to grasp it, and make it sneeze with a potion; if it jumps out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is according to its natural shape. For then it comes out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take mallow mucilage, and linseed oil, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and apply this ointment to the woman's genitals inside and outside, then make her sit in warm water up to the ribs;
and when she is softened underneath, make her a pessary of myrrh, and insert it underneath, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and clear her mouth and nose, and gently press her abdomen, for the child will immediately jump out.
from the child's exit onto her knees When the child comes in this way, the midwife should put her hands on it little by little; then let it be supported at its neck, and its feet hanging down, and let it lie on a bed; and bend its hands little by little, and then take its hands above its belly, and remove the pillows from underneath, until it is positioned downwards; and if the child does not jump, take its feet and move them strongly, then move its belly upwards, then put your hands there; and draw the child out little by little; and instruct the woman to hold herself until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child who comes from the womb, a hand hanging down It is necessary to contrive to bring back the hand: if one cannot bring it back, then make the woman stand, and walk;
if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and spread her legs widely;
then administer the mucilage that I have recounted;
and if she does not give birth, then make her sit on a seat, then study bringing back the hand; and draw out the child according to its natural position, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out.
of the child's emergence over its neck, and its hands spread out, and its face turned towards its mother's back it is necessary that the midwife hold its hand, then turn it little by little, and draw it out gently;
and when it is even, then apply to the part a poultice of mallow and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner with all the afterbirth
in this same manner with all the afterbirth When it comes out in this manner with all the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the navel so that it is not retained, and the child dies;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and instruct the woman to take herself sometimes:
Of the birth of twins Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except a few.
Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except a few. I know that, if they are multiplied, and are separated by the membrane which divides them, which is attached to the womb;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single one, as we have said.
And if they come out with difficulty, treat them as we have said, and let the delivery be subtle, and do quickly and easily what she does; and do as best serves for salvation. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb, one or two or three or four or five or six or seven, or more up to fifteen, and are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the glorious sage, and the midwife must know all this, for by chance similar things happen; then do as is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in her womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to use your hands; then you must know if the woman is of sound virtue, and has no accident or fear of death;
then the woman must be laid on her back, and her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised;
and the attendant hold her in two places, or she be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mallow and fenugreek mucilage and flaxseed, then let the midwife oil her hands with these oils and mucilages;
then insert them into the womb lightly, then find a place where she inserts the unguents that are suitable for this, and take care if the child is positioned so that it descends headfirst;
then insert the unguents into its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or in the fork or near the ribs, and if the descent is feet first, then insert them into the heel and the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the unguent with his right hand, and put the curvature between the fingers of his left hand, and insert it with his whole hand lightly, and insert the unguent into any of those places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty thing;
then insert another unguent against it, or a third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then stretch it equally by moving from one side to the other, so that the pus comes out, and let the unguents be toothed to hold the pus, as is the shape here:
And if some part remains, let him smear some of his fingers with oil, and put them in that part, and pull out the other part;
and if some still remains, put this unguent on a higher place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and he cannot bring it back because of the tightness, then you must wrap it in a cloth until it all comes out; then cut it at the joint of the sole or at the heel, and thus you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the head of the child is swollen and it is narrow at the exit, or it has collected sharp water on the head, then you must put the spatumile espinous between your fingers, and split the head and extract the water; or you round it with the instrument which is called "almidach", of which the form comes with the instruments in the chapter which is after this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with tongs, and if the head jumps out and it is pulled with force, let it be split, until the moisture which is in the worst part issues forth;
and if it cannot come out, then cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it so that the moisture runs out.
And if the child is on its feet, then the extraction is easy, and the straightening at the mouth of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around the hand; and split the belly or chest, until the moisture that is there runs out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the midwife puts her hand into the depths of the womb, and pulls it out to the mouth of the womb; then puts in one or two fingers, and pulls it forcefully;
and if the mouth of the womb is constricted by a hot abscess that has formed there, then you must not work there, but must administer moist and greasy things; and apply plasters, and sit in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it straight, then administer what we have said for a living child;
and if one does not have the power [to do so], then pull it forcefully piece by piece, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then administer what we have said for hot abscesses that occur in the womb;
and if a flow of blood comes, then let it be put in astringent water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had been dead, then another was conceived upon that one, and the other was also dead. After a long time, an abscess came to her in the groin, and it swelled until it opened, and began to greatly suppurate.
I was called to the treatment, and I thought about it for a long time, and I could not heal the wound.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out of it, and after some days another. I marveled greatly, because the belly has no bones.
So I thought that it was the bones of a dead child.
I searched the wound, and extracted many bones, until the woman was better; and the woman lived a long time thus, and a little pus always came out of the place;
and I have only recalled this chapter because, when the master finds a strange thing, that he may know how to provide help.
Afterwards comes the form of the press, with which one presses the books;
and with two turnings at the two ends of the two cords. However, the horns should be more subtle than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the wood one inch wide, and the margin of the boards one inch, and one and a half palms long; and between the two cords should be two additions of this same wood, which should be fastened in one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two additions are put in the mouth of the vice to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar but more subtle and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, similar to tongs; and it should have at the two ends two additions, as you see, one palm long, and two inches wide;
and when you want to open the vice with the whole instrument, make the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down and her legs open, then put the two additions fitted together into the vice, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then work your hand with the whole instrument, as you did with the tongs equally, according to the amount that you want to open the mouth of the vice, until the opening makes what it wants.
These instruments are all surpassed, and their forms are multiplied; and when the surgeon has prepared them, the work is so much faster, and higher for men because of their quantity.
Do not despise the instrument that you have not prepared, for their necessities are not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained in childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a potion, and squeeze her hands on her mouth and nose; and if she expels it by this, it is well.
If not, take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia lignea, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in the pot in water over the fire;
then put one end of a tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the womb, and hold it until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. If the secundines (afterbirth) come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand in sesame oil or in mallow poultice, and then put it into the vagina, and search for the secundines; and when she has found it, let her take it and gently and gradually pull it straight, so that the womb does not fall during extraction;
but it must be moved slightly to the right and to the left, and then pulled; then it will come and detach itself.
And if the mouth of the womb is very constricted, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing, and of herbal fumigation;
and if it does not come out from all that we have said, see that you do not tire yourself in pulling;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the womb, that you tie it to the thigh of the woman, then clysterize it with tetrafarmacon ointment; then it will rot and soften, and come out.
But nevertheless, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Then suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
Some of the ancients have tested a fumigation of cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass similar to a funnel, and one puts the thin end inside the body, and the wide end over the fire;
and let the fumigation be on the coals, and burn it until it is consumed, and begin again with another.
Many children are born who do not have the fundament pierced, but it is stopped up by a thin membrane: therefore it is necessary for the midwife that she pierce that membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and guard the incision so that she does not touch it;
then put on wool soaked in wine and oil, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will close up again, put a lead cannula into the opening, and leave it there for several days, and it should be removed when the child wants to go to the toilet.
And sometimes this obstruction comes from a sudden wound or abscess; then it is necessary to cut that obstruction; then it should be treated, as we have said of the lead cannula.
Fistulas which come from beneath the fundament are swellings and enlargements which come near the fundament outside, or in the space between the two parts, so there is one fistula or several;
and when that swelling is old, it works, and furthermore moist, white pus or subtle matter, and sometimes these fistulas are perforating;
and are known by the fact that there comes from it, with excretion or flatulence, when the patient excretes, and perhaps a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce as far as the bladder, and as far as the middle of the penis; and reach as far as the joint of the thigh, and as far as the buttock.
And thus one recognizes the fistula perforating the fundament, and not perforating: and it is that you put your index finger in the fundament, and put a thin needle of bronze or iron in the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, then put a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or the hair at your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and there is no discharge of excretion or flatulence or worm from the opening, as we have said: know that it does not pierce; then hasten to cure it.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary duct, the urine escapes, and it cannot be healed by medicines.
If it is pierced to the hip joint, the tent is coming to the place; if there is no tortuosity and the origin of the pain is around, then it always swells, and neither medicine nor treatment by ointment helps;
and in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure except labor, and the vanity of foolish doctors who meddle with them.
In that which is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope of healing by iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies on his back in your hands;
and he lifts his legs up to his thighs, and has his thighs bent towards his belly; then put in a tent of bronze, or of lead if there is tortuosity, until you know where the tent comes to.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you must put your index finger there, if you then feel that the tent has pierced it;
and let it be uncovered where you feel between your finger the pus or the flesh, then know that it is penetrating; if you do not work at it, it cannot be healed.
It is said however that one can heal some, but that happens rarely;
and the help that is done there, is that one heats the cautery subtly according to the width of the fistula, as is said before; and puts it, all hot, into the fistula, until it reaches near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that the rotten flesh is burned, which is similar to a bird's feather;
and then treat it with tents moistened in butter, until that flesh comes out, then treat it with ointment which generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, it cannot be healed otherwise;
and if the tent enters, and does not pierce to the finger which is at the bottom, and there is between your finger and the tent a thick covering of flesh or of membrane, and you see the fistula at that which follows the covering of the heart; then cut from the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent always forward, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the end of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those rotten parts that resemble a bird's feather, and let nothing remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
For fire cautery combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of those added parts, and the staunching of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat it with tents moistened in butter or in crushed herbs, until the place sheds pus, and the burnt flesh separates in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that soften hard flesh, and are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula goes as far as the bottom of the fundament, and is distant from the body, put your finger into the fundament, and investigate it.
If you feel the tent, and between the two is the membrane or the fascia or flesh, where it is about to pierce, there is no other recourse than hope and expectation, through the use of one of three methods:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, you place tents there and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the ligament that holds the fundament, and the excretions come out involuntarily; then treat it, as we have said;
then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and cleanse it after it is cut near the fundament, either with a tent or with another pointed instrument; then cleanse that rotten flesh which is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound, and to leave the fistula in the part outside the fundament:
then strive to restore the wound, and to leave the fistula in the part outside the fundament: this will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes there are fistulas in this manner: and it is when you put the tent in the fistula, and it is at the side of the fundament near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the end according to this form: And in it put a twisted thread in two, and put the tent with the thread into the fistula until it is at the head.
If it is penetrating in the margin of the fundament inwards, then draw the thread from that hole, so that you put your finger in the fundament;
and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and draw one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and they fall out;
then cure the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in all the ways that you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to cut too deeply for the laceration, and then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatumile espinous with which one opens the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the fundament, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they constantly bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the fundament and at the end of the fundament;
but those which are outside have little moisture, and constantly exude a little citrine water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the cure of those who have them inside the fundament, is that you instruct the patient to strain to go to the chamber, until the fundament comes out, and the threads appear; then hurry, and hang it with tongs, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, then take them with a cloth, or with cotton, or a piece of camlet; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle on top some hot powders that are in place of a cautery; or you cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then cure them with other cures until they are healed;
and if the matter cannot come out, then give the patient a clyster of a biting and harsh clyster to wash what is in the fundament, so that it may come out clearly; when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy;
when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your fingernail or with pincers, and cut them, then cure them as we have said, until it is healed, and that it dreads incision by iron. Then you must administer the suture according to this manner:
Then you must administer the suture according to this manner: take one twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then draw the thread above and make the needle pierce on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and pull the thread strongly, then knot the thread, and pull out the needle, and do so for all the others, and leave one to run off the excess blood;
then put on the wound a cloth moistened in rose oil or in cerate, and put it on the wound, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they have fallen off, then treat them with ointment and other treatment, until they are healed.
of the dryness of the anus or wound Often there is dryness of the stool in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use. Then you must scrape with the point of a spatula or with your nail the surface, so as not to let it moisten; then treat it until it is healed as it should be;
and if it cannot heal, then repeat the scraping more forcefully than before, until it heals well and is scraped; then treat it until it is healed.
of the tremor Formication is a small, creeping sensation around the body, and it goes very deep;
and sometimes it finds the cold, and one feels it as if dead from trembling, and it comes throughout the body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that quill on the tremor, until the circle encompasses the tremor entirely; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the tremor, and place it deep, and pluck the tremor from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a quill of bronze or iron according to this form, and let it be fine below and thick above: not pierced, to hold easily, and press easily.
And if you wish, cauterize the tremor, as is described before in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or pewter, or of molten or hammered bronze;
and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those therefore which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small.
Those therefore which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is wider above, where the belly is tied in this manner:
and there is an opening where the belly is tied, as you see, and the end is pierced inside;
and has on one side two holes, and on the other one;
and let the belly, where one puts the medicines, be of an animal bladder or parchment, and let it be pierced all around with small holes, and let there be one finger's breadth between each hole, then put into these holes a strong thread of raw thread twisted in X or around, and gather the belly like a goat's bladder; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then clysterize;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the minister squeezes it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs to the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps a whole night, it is a greater help.
And if you clysterize him for a disease of looseness of the bowels, and the medicine hastens to come out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as fine as for a child;
and this is the form of the fine clyster on which the skin is stretched:
We have, I said in the division, the cure of wounds;
or we will tell you the cures by hand and by medicine, according to the accomplishment.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and from what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of a stone, and the blow of a sword and knife, or of a lance or stick or arrow, or similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure of each wound, and will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, then take care if it is from a thrown stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear the rising of a hot abscess: then make it bleed at once from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the injured part;
and let the patient avoid fullness of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be lessened, and let him drink no wine, nor eat any meat;
and put on the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton moistened in rose oil only, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not moved by the air, powder, which I will mention shortly afterwards;
and if the burning has moved it, put on some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, such as from a sword cut and similar, and the lips cannot be brought together by tents, bring them together by stitching, as I will describe for abdominal wounds, of the stitching.
If the wound is laid open to the bone, and hangs, and only holds by a little, cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat strong foods, such as heads and cooked wheat, also such as poultry, and similar things.
And if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut away all the putrid part, and throw it away, then treat it;
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, seek the artery, and if you find it loose, tie it with a thread; and if that does not help, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and it is that you put in this powder which heals before the wound has changed.
And the manner of the powder is: take incense, one part; dragon's blood, two parts; quicklime, three parts, and powder it finely, and apply to the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it untied, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses only lime, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but only if the burn has not moved the wound.
And if the burn has moved the wound,  it is the same, so one does not put this powder there;
but one applies some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it throws out pus; then cure it with other cures until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, extract it with fine forceps;
and I will tell you later about head fractures.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and not to apply anything constricting, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and not to put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be soft, such as warm washing in sweet water, and mixed with rose oil, and cooked also in sweet water, and other precious stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, pierce it in the lowest place;
and if the artery is cut, and a flow of blood comes from it, tie it off, and bind it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the passage is guarded, through which the flesh goes, sew the heart to the throat's  pipe, and do not touch the throat but replace it according to its natural shape; and then bind it carefully, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, search it; and if there are pieces of bone, pull them all out if you can, and those that you cannot get, leave until the wound festers, and the exit is cleaned and aligned;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a blow from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, see if air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it up because the blood would be stopped in its depths, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but put attractive ointment on it, and bind it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; thus there will come no spasm, nor evil tremor of the heart, nor constrictions of the breath; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is saved. Treat it then with tents and other treatments, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and festers, always know that there is a fistula;
then treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, on the chest or back, treat it as one would treat a wound on the front; if it is large, with sutures;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it has reached the bone, and has cut pieces, search the wound, and draw out splinters if they are separated; and if they are not separated, let the wound fester, this will ease extraction;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large and medium and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, protrude, causing their intrusion;
and the stitching is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in, if one does not put them back in immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, so they are more difficult to replace, and therefore the medium wound is better, because one more easily replaces the intestine in its place than in the other two.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common sutures occur in the suture of the belly, and the suture of the other wounds of the body and two other proper sutures are common to the other wounds;
and yet they are more proper with the suture of the belly, and I will describe each one and explain it.
I say that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to replace it, this is by one of the two methods: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or boil in water with squill and cypress and spike, and sprinkle the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes astringent wine does this, and is better than plain water for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallows have been boiled, for by this the entrance is easily closed.
and if it cannot enter, then slightly open the wound with the instrument with which one cuts hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, so that no one should cut without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
cut into the curvature and not outwardly, and see here the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, then replace it according to its natural form in its proper place, if you are able, for this is worth much.
When the wound is large, and it is in the part below the belly, then you must make the patient lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the part below the belly, then put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, then put your attention to that the injured part be higher than the other;
and thus it is necessary to administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, put what is prepared, then have between your hands a pitiful minister who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common manner of sutures, and it is that you take one needle or more, according to the quantity of the width of the wound, then leave from the head of the wound one finger's breadth of space, and there insert a needle where there is a good strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the siphac, which is beneath the skin within, until you make it pierce that part, and bring together the two edges of the siphac and the four together;
then tighten a doubled thread around the needle on two sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound neatly, and then leave one finger's breadth of space, and insert another needle;
then tie the thread as you did the first needle, and do not cease doing this according to the need for needles, until the entire wound is closed;
and let the needles be medium, between fine and thick, for fine needles cut all the flesh, and those too thick cannot enter well: therefore, they must be medium;
and it is not necessary to push the needles too far outside the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before the suture;
and then cut the ends of the needles, that they may not injure the patient in his sleep, and put tents or cloths at the ends of the needles to hold them, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of suturing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles suffice.
The second suture is common, and is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the muscle with a needle with a single strong medium thread;
and when you have pierced these four edges together, then return the needle to the part where you began, in the manner in which cloths are sewn;
and place between each stitch the thickness of a little finger;
This suture is known to men, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a handspan wide, and the intestines protruded well two handspans, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been twenty-four hours outside, and the wound was healed in fifteen days, and I treated it, and it was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle;
and I did not treat it with ointment, for I was in a place where none could be found, nor any medicines; and I put clean cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper methods of suture:
Take the needle, and put it from the outer part to the inner;
when it has pierced straight through, leave the head of the siphac or the thread where you have put the needle, and make it pierce from the other side, from the inner part to the outer;
and the meaning of this suture is that you sew as the furriers sew furs, and that you leave the thread on one side once, and take it again on the other, until the suture is entirely completed.
The second method of suture, which Galen calls proper, is as some do, who assemble the two parts together naturally, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle in the head of the thread nearby, and make it pierce only that place, and leave the two ends of the thread; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outer part to the inner, with the two ends of the thread;
then make it pierce one and the other from the outer part to the inner, in two other places of the thread which are on the other side;
and this is the best method of suture and the most common.
Galen says this, and some testify, that one should sew the belly with two needles, with thread in each;
and one should put one needle on one side, and the other on the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the suture is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the heat has changed it, then replace the intestine, and sew it;
then put on the flesh-generating powder, and if the heat has changed it, then put on any ointment that is present, until the wound heals; and clean the threads, and let the surfaces and the muscles be joined; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you have no medicines, then put on, as soon as it begins to produce pus, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any other medicine in many situations when the wounds are simple;
and if you fear that the wound will spread to the principal members, then you must moisten light wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the armpits and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or corruption in the bowels, and this often happens, then give him enemas of warm red wine, and likewise if the corruption reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine which is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is wounded, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the intestine protrudes from the wound, put it back in place like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become green or black, then you must tie the place which is black, so that no flow of blood comes there, for there are veins and arteries;
then cut that which is between the ligature, and hang the two ends from the part below the wound to the outside to facilitate extraction when the intestine falls, and the wound heals.
Of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is broken, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly with a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it was infected and became a fistula, and the excrement and wind issued from it;
I treated it as best I could, and I did not cease to refine the treatment until he was healed, and the place was sealed.
And when I saw it sealed, I feared that the patient might have damage in his belly; and there was no harm there, but he remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some practitioners said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in this manner: Take large-headed pins, then bring together the lips of the wound, and when the pin has opened its mouth, place it on the two lips so that it draws its mouth together;
and then cut off its head, and this holds so that it cannot come undone, then put another pin afterwards in the same manner as before, until the whole wound is enclosed; and sew the wound.
These pins burn in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread that is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
take the end of this intestinal thread, which should be very clean, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then put the thread in the needle, and sew the intestine, and bring it back to the opening;
and this method of sewing with pins is not certain except according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the large intestines, there is no remedy or healing, except subtlety.
of a fistula wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it ages, is universally called a "fistula", and especially when it is haired and produces pus.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard and white knotted swelling, where one feels no pain, and it is as hairy as a bird's feather;
and sometimes it discharges clear pus, and sometimes thick; sometimes little, and sometimes enough;
and I have spoken of it in the division of wounds, that every wound which is not healed, and there is no flesh, it is only because of one of the nine causes: that is to say, because of the small amount of blood or humors; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the lips, which does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much swelling; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good for the treatment; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because the property of the region is slow to digest, and slow to heal, and naturally swells; or there are veins or bones there:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the treatments with medicines in the division.
Now it is necessary that I make known to you the treatment of a fistula which is made by the work of hands.
Know that a fistula occurs in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that occur in the large veins, and in the arteries, and in the nerves, or in the peritoneum, or in the intestine, or in the bladder, or in some of the ribs, or in the spine of the back, or in some joint of the hands or feet; and there is such a one that comes to the principal member and similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of difficult healing, and there is nothing but labor and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not reach the place that I have said, and you have confidence in the cure, and you want to know it, then take a tent of bronze or iron, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a slender tent of lead, for lead bends easily around the tortuosity;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot search it well with tents, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture runs from one opening to another, and cleanses it;
then search it wisely to the best of your ability, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and it is deep seated, and ask the patient well about the pain that he feels at the pressure of your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the pus and the corrupted flesh that are within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep and straight, then you must cut deep, as far as you can, then put in moistened tents with medicated water, and push them to the bottom of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not hinder you in the principal limbs, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then clean it until all the corruption is removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns as before, know that you have not gone to the root:
then uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is well. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; then there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it with tongs, then extract it with a suitable instrument, and if there are many bones, then extract them all, and do not leave even one;
and if the moisture opposes you, and there is no error or fear, then cut the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, then put something on the wound that encourages putrefaction, and leave it until the area is rotten around the bones, and then the bones will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, then only remove the corruption until all the blackness is gone, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it is necessary to cauterize and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take an example from it and be aided in your work.
He was a young man of about thirty years, who had pain in his leg from a cause that originated within the body, so that the materials came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no external cause for opening;
but the physicians, through their folly, worked on it so much that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared which all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians treated it for about two years, and there was no expert in surgery, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which it was treated, and what ran through the holes in a great quantity; and the young man's flesh became red, and had a yellowish color.
I inserted a tent into one of these holes, and then I searched all the holes, and found that one led to another from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupt and perforated, and the corruption reached to the bone inside;
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupt bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except that which I removed;
and I began to treat the wound with cauterizing medicines for a long time, and it would not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continued in the bone, and I probed it, and then removed it, and I strove to heal the place; but I could not until I cut around a palm's breadth of the bone, and removed it entirely with its marrow, then I treated it with medicines; and it was healed and soldered quickly, and it was not necessary to recommence the work except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure, and for the fear of death that I had for him. For because of the evacuation he bled often, but he was healed entirely, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and it was of good disposition and had no harm or contrary at all, neither in going nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it must be treated in this manner: take a linen cloth, and bind it to the end of the bone which is exposed, and instruct someone to pull it upwards; and place another linen bandage, thicker than the first, and bind it over the flesh which is above the bone, and stretch the head so that you draw the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh above the place where you wish to sew, so that the suture does not injure the flesh;
and place a hot iron or a heated board under the bone to cut the corrupted flesh;
and it is necessary to sew as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and sew again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then place a hot iron underneath, and then sew from one part to the other the corruption, and let the suture be the length of the corruption a little, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and sew the bone where it contains from the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, that thing is very serious, but nevertheless it is necessary that you examine that corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but so that the vein or the nerve do not hinder you;
and know that the incision and the threads for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and their thinness, and their size and their smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare for each type of work its instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument that you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the types of diseases; therefore consider the instrument that you need according to what is necessary.
The head rots either from an internal cause, or from an external cause;
and when you have treated that corrosion with the remedies, and they do not help, then it is necessary to cut off that member as far as the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes death by this, or by the greater evil, of the loss of the limb;
and the sign is that the limb turns black, so that it seems as if it were burned by fire, and then rots after the blackness, then that corrosion goes from limb to limb, and takes over the whole body;
so hurry to cut it, and if it is from the sting of some venomous beast, such as a sea scorpion and viper and the like, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to come to the hand.
And if it comes to the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it comes to the arm, cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no remedies are of use except the quantity of its strength;
and do the same when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the next joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends in the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die;
and the manner of cutting or sawing off the member is that you tie it above and below, and one attendant stretches one of the ligatures down, and another attendant the other ligature up, and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures to a width of one span, until the bone is uncovered;
then cut or saw, and put on each side a linen cloth, so that the saw does not touch the healthy tissue, and another lesion and abscess are caused to the patient.
And if profuse bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some styptic powders;
then return to your treatment until it is completed, then bind the injured member with a suitable ligature, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man in his foot:
a blackness befell him which resembled a burn from fire, and this corrosion first appeared in his toe, until it affected the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off his foot, and was healed;
and a long time afterwards the corrosion returned to his finger of the hand, and he came to me, and I applied repellant things after the cleansing of the body, and the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also feared that if I cut off his hand, that he would die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recounted this only so that one may do likewise, if one has need.
Sometimes an abscess comes in fleshy tissue, and remains so long that it forms a large collection of pus; and then it bursts and breaks open, and the pus flows out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin that is above is as thin as a fine cloth, and it does not reach to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an illness is called "sain," and is not called "fistula";
but if it is so deep that it reaches the bone, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut that skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not heal because of its corruption.
And if you are confident that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with a clyster thus:
see if the pus is great, and the matter that comes from it is foul-smelling, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put to cook in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and dissolve it in water and honey, and clysterize the sore, and draw out the matter; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then draw it out by squeezing;
do this many times, until the sore is cleansed, and the pus is removed;
and sometimes it is clysterized with lye, when this medicine is not present, and it is that you take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over them, then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the sore is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the lye, then clysterize him with water and honey in which a little ground litharge is mixed; or you may clysterize with honey and mulled wine, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine makes the blood flow;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the sore is well cleansed, then clysterize it with that which causes flesh to grow in it, and it is that you take diaphinite plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you may clysterize it with certain medicines and ointments, of which I have spoken of the properties in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the sore is small, and the nozzle of the clyster cannot enter, widen it slightly with an iron instrument, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too wide, sew it and leave only a space where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is above, cut it in the lower place that there is.
and if you cannot cut the sore below as you wish, prepare it in such a way that the pus flows to the lowest place that there is, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there and if you cannot cut the sore below as you wish, prepare it in this manner: that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidative medicines to put on the sore, and spread on it a linen cloth that covers all the sore; then cut forcefully at the opening of the sore a little wider than before, then spread soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it over the opening of the sore to ease the pus, and do not remove the large outer cloth except once after many days;
and the one that is over the opening of the sore, remove often to remove the pus, and know what flows from the pus, if it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take heed if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in this manner and you see the nature that leaps up from the opening of the sore, know that the sore will heal, and health approaches;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of healing, for health approaches.
For there are men whose flesh grows slowly in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus flows from the sore after many days, know that the sore will not heal;
and if the sore is slow to heal, and is prolonged, add drying medicines moist in substance and dry in effect, such as diafinitive ointment, for it contains a large portion of vitriol, and it is the last medicine;
take diafinitive ointment, and it is made with rose oil, and rose of old wine equal in substance;
then mix it and use it;
and this same is better cooked thickened, when diafinitive ointments are not present, or you take myrrh and aloes and incense, and crush it, and powder it over the honey when it is on the fire;
and then glue a cloth to it, and spread it over the breast, and sometimes one administers long birthwort, and roots of lilies of the valley, which is like chickpea flour and centaury; and use it of simples or of compounds: crush them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey that I have mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this cure, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard members, or on the ligaments; then cure it with the cure of fistula, as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the little finger of the hand, or of the foot, or by chance arises in other fingers;
and when it is neglected, and no care is taken, then there comes a hot abscess, and it runs and throws pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps it will destroy the whole of it;
and the corrosion reaches the bone, until there is foul-smelling pain, and the head of the finger is swollen, and the color is livid.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cut away with iron all the excess that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and injure it, then you must place a thin blade under the nail that is pricking the flesh, and lift it up, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and apply to the remaining flesh burning and corrosive medicines to remove everything; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it and draw it out, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger corrupt, cut it at the joint as previously described, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is wounded and swollen, and it causes great pain, then you must first clean it;
then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across from above, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, apply something that soothes.
The extra fingers that grow on the hands of some men by chance are all fleshy, and by chance there are some where there are bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or their origin is in some of the knuckles.
That which grows in a knuckle of the finger does not move, and that which grows at the joint of the finger, by chance moves;
the treatment of that which is fleshy is light, in this manner: cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
That which grows at the root of the joint is difficult to cure: then be careful of cutting.
In that which grows on the finger at the last joint, it is necessary that you first cut the flesh roundly to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable saw for this, then cure it until it is healed.
The adhesion that occurs between the fingers comes from birth, or from the healing of a wound, or from a burn, or from similar things.
It is necessary that you cut that adhesion, so that the fingers return to their natural forms; then place between them tents or cloths moistened in rose oil, so that they do not adhere; or you place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is necessary.
If adhesion occurs to any of the fingers with the palm, cut that adhesion as necessary.
Varicose veins are large, swollen veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in many parts of the body;
and it happens more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you should sometimes administer a purging of bile, and then bleed from the basilica vein.
The treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out; and the other method is that you open the vein, and draw it all out.
The incision is according to this method: first bathe the leg in very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one, two, or three places, with a wide incision, then lift and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear;
and then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods producing black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The elevation of it is in this manner: shave the patient's leg, if there is much hair, then put it in the bath, and pour hot water over the leg until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, then heat it by the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the knee to the ankle;
then open the skin with an instrument, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when one feels it;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white cord;
then put the instrument underneath, until it is lifted from the skin, and then lift it slightly with the instrument, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the instrument, as you have done, and lift it with another instrument, as you did before;
then cut another section, or several if you need to, then lift it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it to the second section;
then pull it out section by section, until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a needle with a strong double thread in it, and tie it and pull it, and put an instrument underneath, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, then one cannot pull it out or lift it, and it causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, put on the wound wool moistened with wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is constricted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must forcefully split it, but not cut it; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the intestine is curved, and does not cut, lest it cut the vein;
and is of thick curvature, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the form:
This vein is generated in legs, in hot places where no herbs or trees grow, and in earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents and worms are generated within the body, between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very large inflammation comes in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead of one and a half to two fingers' width, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging on the leg, and every time something comes out of it, wrap it around the lead and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part of it, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root, until it is all emerged; for if you cut it, it returns into the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad illness;
because of which it is necessary that it be treated little by little to the end, and that nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when it is treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it came out ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe into the hole, and probe it to the bottom, so that everything comes out;
and let the matter which is inside be emptied, and administer to the place medicines preventing putrefaction for some days, then cure it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many roots, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and there are many holes, and from which roots sprout;
cure it then as we have said before.
of the worms which are born between skin and flesh This illness is called in our land "ox disease," because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm which is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body rising and falling, and one feels it well in going from member to member, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and then leaps forth;
and is engendered from the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and lumbris and ascarides come in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes to the eye, perhaps it enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you see it to cure and draw it out, then one cannot pull it out except when it moves:
then it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong ligature tightly, then cut above and draw it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you do not find it, then cauterize it with fire above, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does, is that it corrodes the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, then pull down the eyebrow firmly underneath it, then cut above, and draw it out;
and it is necessary to treat the patient with bodily cleansing and purgative medicines for the bad putrid humors, and to warn him against foods producing putrefaction.
Of the pain which comes from flatulence This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in certain limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw that which I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and a little afterwards, I saw it ascend like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from place to place;
the pain departed from that place, and fixed itself in the shoulder, and then a little afterwards ran through the whole body, until it came into the other arm;
then she told me that it turned constantly around the body, as I saw it.
I marvelled greatly how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. Nevertheless, I had seen many who had felt pain move from place to place, but I had not seen it, as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and the veins uncovered, and therefore that constrained windiness appeared;
and it does not appear for this reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears as we have said, then bind it above and below quickly, and then cut above until that constrained windiness escapes from the place; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with that which expels windiness, such as foul-smelling pills, and pills of serapinum, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearance and according to the places of the body where they fall.
The diversity of them is that there are those which have large points, and small, and barbed, and smooth; and of those which have two angles, and of those which have tongues, and of those where there are pieces;
and that which falls in a limb falls in two ways: or in a principal member, such as brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it then falls in any place of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, appear: then you must beware of extracting this arrow, for death follows in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deep, then I draw it, and cure the wound.
And the signs in the brain when the arrow falls there and pierces the bone, and the dura mater which is above the brain bursts, are when there is scotoma and sweating and vertigo and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood flows from the nostrils, or from the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and white moisture like pus comes from the wound, and also something like shredded flesh comes out;
and if these signs appear, abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs that the arrow has reached the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were stuck in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and dark blood flows, and there is coldness and cold sweat, and syncope; know then without doubt that death approaches.
And the sign that the arrow has injured the lung is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering of the breast, it is near the small ribs; and he breathes heavily and has great pain and sighs; and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something of the undigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and a point of dung spurts out through the torn intestine, there is no hope of cure, nor of extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine spurts out and flows uncontrollably, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other limbs, such as the face and the neck and the throat and the shoulder and the arm and the spine of the back and the ribs and the thigh and the legs, and similar limbs, are safe according to various conditions. When the arrow is in the nerve or the artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and pulled it out from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I pulled out an arrow for a man that had struck him in the fatty tissue of the eye under the eyelid; and the arrow was embedded, and I could only reach the point toward the shaft, and the arrow was as large as a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs;
the man was healed, and no ill effects came to him.
And I pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was an Arabian one with barbs:
I cut the barbs, and worked so skillfully that I pulled it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I pulled an arrow from a man, that had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, his condition did not change; I cut the arrow, and grasped it, and pulled it out forcefully, and there was no bad accident.
And I saw a man in whom an arrow fell into his back, and the wound was sealed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and he did not change his natural disposition, nor did he find harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow fell, and the wound was sealed; and it remained so without causing great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen into his neck, and was slightly leaning to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had been there three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a fine probe, and did not feel it; and he felt a prickling and pain beneath his right ear.
I thought that it was from the point of the arrow. I applied to the place an attractive and digestive plaster, so that the place would not swell; and the place of the arrow appeared to me.
and the place of the arrow appeared to me. I put the plaster there many days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained so a long time, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose;
and he told me so. I put on the wound a corrosive liquid medicine for many days, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow which was sticking in the place;
then I added to the opening of the wound with that liquid medicine, until the head of the arrow appeared to me visibly;
and the time passed well for about four months, and then I widened the wound so that I put in the forceps, and moved it from one side and the other, and it could not come out;
then I did not cease to refine and devise methods of instruments, until I grasped it one day with well-made forceps, according to what its form will be at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it, and healed the wound.
And the surgeons judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured.
Now I have told you the quality of the extraction of some arrows, so that you apply your care to that which I do not mention, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but the wise master considers even a small thing, and based on what is present and lacking, finds new work, and a new instrument, for dealing with the strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not come out of the limbs where they are stuck except in two ways: either through the place where they entered, or through another place;
and that which leaps out through the place where it entered, that is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes leaping out immediately.
And if it does not leap out immediately, then leave it until the flesh is rotten around it, and the exit is eased;
and also if it is stuck in the bone, and it cannot come out, then leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it leaps out, and if it does not leap out, then pierce around it with a thin drill, until the place around is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is hidden within the body so that it cannot be seen, then search for it with a tent. and if you feel it, then pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot [do so] because of the narrowness of the wound, and because of the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein, then enlarge the wound;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds, then remove the flesh which is pierced on two sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can pull it out;
and be careful that you do not break the arrow, for you would then extract it with greater difficulty.
And if you cannot [do so] at once, leave it until the surrounding flesh is rotted, then pull it out, for the extraction will then be easier. And if the flow of blood hinders you, then administer what we have said in its chapter concerning treatment;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can extract the arrow without danger, either quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and position the patient in the same way he was when the arrow entered, for that is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then position him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes from another direction, where something of it appears, or the skin is swollen where it can be seen or felt clearly:
then cut above it, until the forceps can grasp it, and then extract it: if it jumps out now.
And if it is lodged in the bone, rotate your hand around until it enters the bone and widens the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it for a while, and then resume the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, remove it with the whole shaft;
and if the shaft breaks, and you wish to administer extraction, use a suitable instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the head of the instrument;
and then pull it out, and if the arrow is broken, use an instrument with a point entering inwards, to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut away all the flesh around where the venom is, if you can, then treat the wound as necessary.
And if the arrow breaks in the foot or in the belly or in the bladder or in the side, and it is close, and you can cut to it, then cut;
and be careful not to cut the vein or the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which arrows are extracted is similar to a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds of them: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing head is like a bird's feather, to push at the point of the arrow, as the shape is here:
There are 31 veins from which one bleeds, of which there are 16 in the head, namely: Two temples which are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein which is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein which is at the top of the nose; and the two jugular veins which are in the neck; and the two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth, and these are the veins which are called "augeherich"; and two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the lay people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "fast," and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the lay people call it "vein of the belly," and it is above the fossa, and it is that from which one bleeds, which appears manifestly on the wrist.
And the salvatory vein is that which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and in the foot are three veins: one is below the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein which is called "nose," which is in the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with old cataracts and migraines;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the head of the patient, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient constricts his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging from the head: then press them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and place it under the vein down to the bone, then raise your hand with the whole vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well two fingers across, and let out as much blood as you wish;
then restrain and bind it, until it is healed;
and I have already discussed incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for chronic migraine, and toothache, and habitual ophthalmia, and for watery discharge from the eyes;
and the qualities of bloodletting are as I said: and that the patient restrain his neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed from above;
then lift the skin above the vein upwards towards your index finger, and place the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done with the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need;
then untie the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then apply cotton; and then bind it firmly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have spoken of their cutting and extraction at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the quality is such that the patient twists his neck until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called a "fossor", of which here is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press down with your hand, or something else, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you wish; then untie the patient's neck, and bind the vein until it is healed, and sometimes one works with a wide bandage.
However, it is not necessary that the bandage be too tight; and bind it across, for the bone is near, and perhaps the bandage breaks when it is thin.
Bleeding from the two veins that are in the two temples helps the eyes, and ringworm, and redness, and an inflammation in the eye, and diseases of the face;
and the quality of their bleeding is such that the patient strains his neck by twisting it with some linen, as before;
then bleed him, and let the bleeding be across, a little long and a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the bandage is thin, perhaps it breaks;
then let the blood flow, as much as you need, and then bind on cotton, and bind it well.
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for fever, and for raging thirst, and for facial diseases, such as migraine and redness that comes on the face, especially when it is chronic;
and the method of bleeding is that the patient clenches his throat, then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin bandage, and insert it into the space between the two nostrils, for the vein does not appear clearly there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then bind it for a night, for it is very quickly restored;
Bleeding from the two temples helps with shortness of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and many illnesses, and impetigo, and toothache, and herpes, and fistulas;
and the method of bleeding is that the patient clenches his throat from below on both sides, as we have said;
and let the master stand over the head of the patient, and let the patient sit on a seat, then open the vein lengthwise a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is necessary;
then do likewise in the other vein, then untie the ligature, and bind both veins moderately, so that the patient does not choke; and leave it until morning, so that the wound is healed.
Of bleeding the lips Bleeding the veins of the upper lips helps with bile in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and around.
And the manner of bleeding is to make the patient sit before you, and bind his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, one of which is on the right lip and the other on the left, and one knows them by the fact that they are black, and by the fact that around them are small black veins:
then cut one and the other, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt, then cut the larger one on each side, and do the same with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
Of bleeding under the tongue Bleeding from the veins that are under the tongue helps after bleeding from the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient sits between your hands before the sun, and lifts his tongue, and looks on each side for a black vein:
bleed then one and the other, and do not go too deep, for underneath are the arteries.
The veins of the neck which are commonly bled are bled according to two methods:
either by pricking with a flat, myrtle-wood lancet, or a slender, olive-shaped one like a cutting knife, and it is called "anesil"; and they are broad and slender according to the breadth and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the myrtle-wood lancet is very renowned, and is broad as you see:
And it is needed to open hairy veins full of thick, apparent blood, and which contain thick and troubled blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped lancet:
and it is more slenderly pointed, and is for bleeding the slender veins, where there is thin, citrine blood.
Bleeding from the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is necessary for the bleeder that he bleeds wisely, and that he guards himself from the artery which is beneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then he must stanch it, as I have said; and the blade should not be pointed, but cutting like a chisel.
And if the basilica does not appear clearly, then you must search for it, and choose another; or you seek a vein near it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut it with a chisel-like blade, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of bleeding, it is necessary first that you straighten the arm, that you touch the place until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the chisel-like blade; and beware that you do not injure the artery when you see the place swollen, for that is the artery: wipe it then.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is arterial blood: hasten yourself then, and put your finger on it for a while, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; if not, bind the arm, and leave it so, and let the patient not move it;
and let it be without fear, and do not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overwhelms you, and medicine is not at hand, then cut the artery if it is visible, for the head retracts from it; and stop the blood.
And take a piece of fig bark, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind it on well until the next day;
If the blood stops, it is good; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the stopping is not difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound, and the strength of the ligament of the arm.
The bloodletting of the vein in the middle helps because it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilica and the cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be careful about the nerve that is below, and if he goes too deep, and he finds the nerve, and it swells and the bleeding is difficult, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve is often visible, and if it is not visible in some men because of its thinness, then you must bleed it with a lancet; and avoid the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, cut it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking the olivary vein or the myrtle vein, for it is the safest of all the veins, for it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, one should seek the easiest place, and it does not matter if one fails the first time, and one tries again; and perhaps the place swells in some men when one fails the first time, but it does not matter.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your judgment.
The first thing you must know about bloodletting is that bloodletting is not administered except to preserve health and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bloodletting be done in one of the three veins that are in the arm: that is to say, cephalic, median, and basilic; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear;
and one should bleed on the first day or the third, after two or three hours of the day.
The bloodletting which is administered for illnesses has no determined hour, but when need is, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and one should not bleed children until fourteen years, nor a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh. Nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary that he cleanse the intestines with a light clyster, if he has much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
nor should one bleed him who is too full of food, nor who is drunk, until he is sober, nor the dropsical;
and one should beware of bleeding after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, and excessive intercourse with women, and labor, wakefulness, and fasting, and anything that diminishes strength, whether of body or mind;
then thin the humors, if the blood is thick, by food and drink and by medicines, if you have the power;
then enter the bath, if nothing forbids it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein of the breast near the third rib, as we have said;
and on that day guard yourself from work, and pain, and lust, and similar things;
and be cheerful and joyful, and let the bleeder be higher than the one being bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tie the ligature moderately above, for when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the place with the hands, until the veins swell, and one feels them;
then the bleeder moistens the lancet with a little old oil, then puts the finger of his left hand on that vein a little below the place where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and fail when it is struck.
For there are veins that flee like strings when being bled, and there are some that are full of windiness, so that when one puts the lancet to them, they withdraw from the lancet, and the vein cannot be opened, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be skilled in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; if not, he begins again a little below or above that place quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave him one or two days, and do not bind the arm: perhaps an abscess will form there;
nor enter a bath, then resume the bloodletting if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you doubt that as much blood will come out as you wish, strike into that same opening with the whole blade straight;
and work somewhat quickly, before the place is swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not resume the bloodletting, and put on a little oil of lead, for it lightens the body of the blood, and the lead is milder in this place than the oil;
and thus administer the oil of lead in each bloodletting that you bleed the veins, to staunch the flow of blood;
and this same thing does theriac and the ox-gall, when one puts it on the place; it thins the blood and it disperses when it is too thick.
And if there comes a large abscess, which happens many times, especially when it is not bled sufficiently except at that time when the opening of the vein is small, then hasten, and put on the place a sponge moistened in water and in salt a little warm, and hold it for an hour;
and it is necessary that you do this after the flow of blood from the vein, and if there remains at the place after some days some blackness or greenness, it does not harm it; and if you wish, put on something of aloes or of myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, or mint, or the like.
And many times an abscess occurs and an appearance at the bleeding of the basilica vein:
then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft at the compression of the hand, then that appearance is bad. Avoid therefore that you put on anything of what we have said, for perhaps it would cut off the artery;
but make him a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.
And draw from each one blood according to the quantity of his strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is necessary for one who is full-bodied and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made for him, and the lancet be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should bleed little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bloodletting is safer from the flow of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding lengthwise or across.
And to one whose body fails during bloodletting, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is feverish, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of cold complexion, let him eat before bloodletting bread soaked in spiced syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-fragrant syrup.
And if he faints during bloodletting, after the loss of much blood, he should drink broth of meat, and subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have mentioned in the section or chapter on syncope, for the opening of a vein.
And if he wishes to bleed his arm, and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bloodletting, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his strength continuously.
And whoever wishes to bleed his arm after the first bloodletting, and he has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bloodletting, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wishes to bleed from another place, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; therefore it is necessary to draw a great quantity, and widen the opening until it falls into a faint; then when you observe all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand upon his pulse while he bleeds, that death may not come in place of a faint, and this happens many times, when the phlebotomist is negligent;
and it is not necessary when you wish to untie the arm, and to let blood out a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor if it is curved, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but leave it until he bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of the lancet, until the blood which is frozen in the opening of the vein flows freely, and put on it a little salt dissolved in water, and press upon it lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not bind it, until the abscess is subsided.
And if there is need to draw blood a second time, bleed him in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the arm is bled in place of the vein in the head because it is well-composed.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the vein is red;
then it is moderately bound, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it immediately across, not across the width or length;
and let the opening be wide, and let it be bled very near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for one puts it in more in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve there.
Bleeding from the salvatiel vein of the right hand is good for all liver diseases, and this is the manner:
constrict the hand, and put it in warm water, until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if it bleeds across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, completely bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is congealed in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is necessary, put oil and wax on the vein to seal it quickly, and thus do for each vein.
Bleeding from the left hand is good for the disease of the spleen, and do just as I have told you for the right.
Bleeding from the saphena vein is good for all the diseases that are in the lower body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menstrual flow, and disease of the kidneys, and of the old thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it swells, and ties above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot many veins go;
bleed then in the largest vein, or at the ankle, which is most effective.
And if you bleed it above the foot, beware of the nerves that are underneath, and bleed it across as if cutting;
and let the blade be sharp.
And if the blood cannot flow out, put the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, begin again a little higher up, for the place is salty;
do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and its bleeding is good for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is such that the patient enters the bath, and presses above the ankle with four fingers twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in every way that you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very responsive in many men.
and it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very responsive in many men. And if you do not find it, bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and make as much blood run as you wish, and then untie the ligature, and put on cotton and bind it; it is now healed.
Cups are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass;
and venesection is done according to two methods: either by cutting and drawing blood, or without cutting.
And this venesection which is without cutting is according to two methods: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and venesection which is done by cutting and by extraction of blood is done in fourteen places of the body, of which one is at the very top of the head; and the other is in the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping below the chin; and the cupping on the two shoulders; and the cupping above the buttocks; and the cuppings between the two arms; and the cuppings on the two legs; and the cuppings on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw blood except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not weaken one, as bleeding from a vein does; and it is not necessary that it be administered, either with fire or without fire, in any illness that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if, by necessity of illness or custom, it is necessary to cup, then we administer it every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle, and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and dead people and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is mid-month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the temples helps the headache... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and it is not necessary that one who has a cold complexion use it, or who has a catarrh, for it does them much harm;
and therefore it is not necessary that the elderly use it, nor those who have cold diseases in the head.
And he who is often bled in this way becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping a little lower because of the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bloodletting from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for tightness of the chest, and for splitting of the lung canal, and for cough, and for repletion;
and it should be applied lightly, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or stomach and heart problems.
Cupping at the two ribs of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for strangulation, and for pain at the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bloodletting from the basilic vein;
and you must instruct the bleeder to carefully place his hand, that he not cut the artery, and that blood does not flow excessively.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth disease, and for corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and is in place of bloodletting from the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and fullness.
Cupping of the thighs is as good as three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from those large veins;
and instruct the phlebotomist not to cut too deeply, for the place is bare of flesh, and beneath are nerves and arteries.
The cupping glass which is on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament, and for illnesses below, and it is necessary that the cupping glass be large, and be of bronze, that it may draw well; and perchance, if it were thin, it would break; and it makes large wounds.
Cupping on the legs is manifestly beneficial, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the loins, and of the womb, and of the bladder, and restore menstruation;
and are applied to the area of the two shinbones, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many instances.
The method of applying the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and apply it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease to do this, until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears;
then heat, and reapply the cupping glasses, and take heed of the constitution of the bodies, for there are some who have tender flesh, and open pores: then it is necessary to apply the cups only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and somewhat deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to apply the cups twice: the first time to refine the path of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, then it is necessary to apply the cups a third time;
and when we wish to draw blood little by little, then one time is sufficient. And if we want a lot of blood, then we repeat it often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart should be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with aperitive and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take marjoram oil, or balm oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.
And if the one whom you are treating has tender flesh and large pores, then it is not necessary to put any oil there, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And the one who has much moisture, should be washed with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities should be washed with old wine, or beet juice, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things;
and it is not at all fitting to cup before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath, one or two hours;
and do not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that he be warm, when he is to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And beware if the one who is being treated is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat pullets, and the meat of a wether, and moist meats.
and eat pullets, and the meat of a wether, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, should take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat pullets and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day that he is cupped, he ought to drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before or after cupping, to strengthen the principal members; and let the blood be thinned, but it is not necessary that those who are hot drink it.
The cupping glasses which are applied without cutting are those which are applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the groin and the kidneys and the hip, for these members do not tolerate being cut, and it is only done to draw blood from member to member, just as we apply them to the breasts when the milk is diseased;
to remove the viscosity which is in the member, just as we apply cupping glasses to the belly and to the groin to soften the member;
and removes the pain, when there is an obstruction or stone, it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and so it does when one applies it to the liver and to the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cupping glasses are applied empty to suck only; and sometimes they are applied with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a way that one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping glass applied with fire is this:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and let it have on the side around the middle a small hole, as for inserting a needle, and let it be of bronze, smooth in front so that it does not injure the patient when placing it on the limb;
and let it have in the middle a crossbar of bronze or iron, to place a burning candle, and let there be both large and small ones according to the diseases and the age of those who use them;
for the cupping glasses of children are different from those of old people, and of thin people from those of fat people.
And one must thus place this cupping glass on the limb:
take the candle of wax or a liniment, and place it in the cupping glass across the bar which is in the cupping glass, so that the light is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the hole that we have mentioned, so that when one wishes, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the liniment as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass then, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with hot water, there is no bar or hole, and it is not administered except when it is full of water, and it is placed only on the limb;
and this is the method:
Leeches are administered only in limbs where cupping glasses cannot be placed because of their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and others similar;
and the quality of the leeches is that when you find leeches that are in clear fresh water without corruption, you take them;
and put them for one night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then let blood be drawn with a vein incision and cupping, then rub the limb until it is red, and apply the leeches;
and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply a cupping glass, apply it, for that is very beneficial afterwards.
If not, raise the place with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then wipe it;
and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches are removed, moisten a linen cloth in cold water, and apply it, until the bleeding is stopped;
and if the bleeding is excessive, apply crushed vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it is stopped;
or you may put on the place halves of peeled beans, and leave them until they dry on the place, it will stop immediately;
and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches will not attach, rub the place with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood flows, and then apply them, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you see that they fall off, sprinkle a little aloe and salt, or ashes, they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is the restoration of fracture and dislocation.
Know, dear son, that foolish people scorn this chapter, because they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read any letter of them;
and for this reason the science is strange in our land, for I never found any good one;
and I know nothing, except through the science of the ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have drawn the science from them, and by experiment, and by the custom of my life;
and I have described to you in this chapter what is contained in it, and I have shortened it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is necessary then that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the speech and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or contusion comes to someone, it is necessary that you hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you, such as weakness of body, or a child, or an old man; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and let him eat cold things, that is to say cold dishes, and the flesh of birds and of kid, and let him not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and let him not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you have no fear of a hot abscess, or of the spread of matter to the limb;
then let the patient return to his former regime that he used.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that one nourish the patient with foods that produce strong nourishment, or which have viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and tripe of cow, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the bone mends and the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that the broken bones of the old and the decrepit cannot be well mended or healed according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs, nor those also which are too tender, such as the bones of little children;
but without fail, reset the broken bone with strong bandages which support and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not cease from this work, and for this reason it is necessary to nourish him with strong foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the breast, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes across, and another diagonally, like the cutting of a quill for writing.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another diagonally, like the cutting of a quill for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small fissure.
And each type has its own device and its own proper instrument in its restoration, according to what comes to mind.
And a fracture of the bone is known because the place is twisted, and it appears well by swelling, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
but there may well be twisting, or a fissure, or a small fracture. Then you must not move it by hand, but apply the medicines that follow, and then gently extract it immediately.
And know that for a fracture that goes spirally, and the two parts are disjointed, you must immediately set them evenly, so that abscesses do not form there;
and if hot abscesses form there, leave it for a few days, until the abscesses are subsided;
then set it evenly so that you can easily and skillfully, and know that the restoration of this is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces;
then extract it, as it is necessary afterwards.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, stretch it from two sides, if it is the hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and put the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, bring back by all means the additions to their places as best you can, and take care that by your work there comes no injury or pain to the patient;
and join well the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well:
then straighten it beautifully, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do who cause by their work a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have seen many times.
And when the limb is set, instruct the patient well that he not move it, neither while awake nor while sleeping, neither by turning nor in any other manner; and ensure well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not set, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and ensure well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not set, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and take care that it is placed straight, that no crookedness comes when it is restored;
and the condition of the broken limb is according to what I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in largeness and in form.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and the like: then it is necessary to wrap it with soft and fine linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thigh and leg:
then it is necessary to wrap it with a wide and strong linen, for the wide linen embraces the whole large limb, and binds it equally on all sides, so that there is no gap;
then tie around light tow, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the whole linen, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture may then slightly separate the fracture;
and soften the linen little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another linen, and turn it around again over the broken area;
then return to the area below the fracture, and bind it moderately, neither too tightly nor too loosely, as we have said in the first chapter above;
then place between the linen bandages tow or cloths, until it is all even, then bind all above with a bandage, and then apply your well-made splints, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then apply something that soothes a hot abscess, and which removes the swelling, and leave it thus for a few days;
then bind on your splints, and let them be half of a wisely sawn broad cane, or of wood from which one makes wedges, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that one puts on the fracture be a little larger and broader than the others;
and let it also be as long as is necessary for the limb, small or large; then bind on the splints as you did in the first binding, then tie over it a suitable thread, as in the first binding over the fracture; tighter above, always less so;
and it is necessary that the threads be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bandages from twisted linen cords, and this is a great error, for the bandage cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not necessary that there be less than the width of a finger between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after the tightening in healthy places, then place under them linen or carded wool padding, so that he is not wounded.
When the wound is accompanied by a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all the broken limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to apply splints except after five days or seven, or more according to your certainty of a hot abscess arising;
And here is the manner of the ancient plasters for restoring fracture, dislocation, and torsion:
and it is that you take the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill, and cook it with plenty of egg, and apply this confection, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common manner of the plaster restoring the fracture in many conditions, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another manner of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and torsion: Take 3 of each of labdanum, enula, asafoetida, gum arabic, and mugwort, 10 of each; myrrh and aloe, 5 of each; alechil 9; and make them into a powder, and mix them with egg white; If the man's complexion is warm, use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is good for many men.
Another kind of plaster that is good for a sprain: take comfrey and mallow, each 10 ounces; myrrh and aloes, each 9 ounces; acacia 6 ounces; Armenian bole 10 ounces, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply it.
Another type of plaster for joints and bones dislocated from their places, and it soothes the accompanying pain, and the splintering and fracture of the bone: Take new wool, and moisten it in vinegar and boiled oil, and apply it to the place.
This plaster does not heal, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and it properly removes the pains.
Another type of plaster which heals broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of henbane, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another type of plaster for the restoration of a broken bone and for diminishing the remainder of an abscess. Take mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, vetch flour, one part of each;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and use it.
Another type of plaster stronger than the first, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of the limb. Take mallow roots, and flaxseed, balaustines, melilot, and comfrey, and violet and chamomile flowers, of all equally one part; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its state.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put anything on a broken limb for restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And it seems to Galen that one should put on the broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and boil equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it.
And then unbind it a little later, and take care if the patient feels no pain, or if the bone has not moved from its place; if not, unbind it in a few days. And if pain or itching comes to the place, without rest or swelling, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take a light cloth, and a moist sea sponge, and dip it in water, and lift the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is appeased; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind it on a nut, until you are sure of a warm abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb will subside, and the pain will be removed, then recommence the subtle binding, and a little of the plaster, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and continue until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess and redness and pain and swelling are completely gone, and you need a plaster and a bandage, then begin again, as you did before equally.
And if nothing of what we have said comes to the limb, then do not unbind it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes leave it twenty days, according to what one sees, until the fracture heals, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then bind it tighter than before, and it thickens its flesh, as I have said before;
and if you see the place drying out more than is necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there; therefore moisten it with lukewarm water, every time you unbind it, and that should be every third day, and loosen the bandage a little;
by this work then nourishment comes quickly to the limb, and hastens the mending of what foolish doctors do, who restore the limb badly:
that is bad, and it is dangerous work, and I see nothing else but negligence and working wrongly.
There are many kinds of fractures, and various forms, and the causes are diverse;
for there are fractures that are made by the blow of a sword, and the neck breaks the whole bone down to the spongy bone that is under the bone, as an axe or club does; and for this reason this kind of fracture is called "hachure".
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this kind of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blunt impact, or a fissure, or a blow from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which reaches down to the membrane which is under the bone, or which is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound which is a crack in the bone as fine as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for this reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound which is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and drives a piece of the bone inwards, and the place is swollen as blacksmiths do when they strike on their anvils; if the stone enters inside.
And this happens more to those who have soft bones in the head, such as the head of a child;
and it happens in all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated like stars; and I will speak of it in its place.
And we recognize all kinds of fractures by the pulling on them, and the probing with probes, and by the corrupted flesh that is on top.
Hairline fractures are known by this, that when the bone is uncovered, and one rubs against it, the black fracture appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the accidents of the patient, and if you see any bad accident, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of consciousness, and convulsions, and fainting, and high fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar things in many conditions, it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you see no frightening accident, and you hope for salvation, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded man first comes to you, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, if you can.
And if it is in summer, hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the flesh under the bone is corrupted, and the accidents that we have mentioned appear.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, it is necessary that you split the broken part thus:
and it is that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way that you can, and over the surface of the wound as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs when uncovering the bone, or a warm abscess, help him with what is necessary, and it is that you fill the place with cloths soaked in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the warm abscess is calmed, and you are assured of the cessation of bleeding; then begin to remove the bone around, and this is done according to two methods of working:
one method is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then make another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and are of untempered iron;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce it around, before you administer incisions with a trephine, not so deeply that it pierces through the skull bone, and it should have above the point a margin or a circle, which prevents the point from passing beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each comes into its place on the thickness of the bone, so that you have trephines for the whole head;
and this is the form of the three types of trephines:
The method for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place a trephine on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then put the trephine elsewhere a little afterwards, and thus do it all around, then cut with the incisors the thickness of the bone which is between the holes, and do this as subtly as you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you extract the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments that you have such as forceps, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and extracted the bone, it is necessary that you remove the remaining fragments of bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other incisors;
and if any small bones or splinters remain, remove them lightly with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with tents and ointments as we have said.
And the other method of operation is that which Galen described, which is safer; and he praises it highly, and that is his word. First, you must uncover a part of the bone where the fracture appears, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form:
And it does not cut on one side, and the sharp part is on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet above, so that you cut the bone lightly all around, and take good care of the membrane that is underneath;
if it is attached to the bone, remove it lightly, for it is removed easily without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not reach the membrane, and the bone is only cut from above, and there are small pieces, then you must remove that roughness, and remove the splinters with a fine rasp of which you should have various sizes, to apply in each place the most suitable, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
Begin first with large rasps, and then with finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well.
In each of the other hairline fractures and subtle breaks, you must apply a remedy according to its condition;
and this is something that is not unknown to one who has applied their study to this art.
And if the syfac is uncovered, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another doubled cloth in two or three layers, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so that you do not injure the syfac, then apply another linen cloth on top, and do not bind it tightly, only enough to hold the wound;
and leave it thus for one or two days, until the swelling of the abscess is subsided, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and chickpea flour, and incense powder, and birthwort, and similar things;
and of these things make a powder, and put it on the wound, and constantly apply cleansing medicines without biting.
and ensure that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment there, nor allow pus to collect, for when pus collects on the brain’s membrane, it corrupts and festers, and great harm comes to the patient;
for when something biting is put on the syfac, it becomes numb on top. Take care then, if any bad accident befalls the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly doubtful.
And if blackness comes there only because of the medicine that has been put on, that has such a property, then you must take one part honey, and three parts rose oil and in it glue one cloth, and put it on the syfac; then treat it with the necessary treatments, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose are broken above, or one by itself, for these are two bones;
and that below is cartilaginous, and does not break, unless it is bent or twisted, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger in the hole of the nose, and set the fracture even with your index finger, and the little finger on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and ensure that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, then you must set it even with the end of a slightly thick stick.
And if the fracture is in two parts, do likewise, and hasten to restore it on the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the swelling of the abscess has subsided, then put into the nostril tents of linen cloths, if the fracture is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the fracture is there; and let the tents be so large that they fill the holes of the nose.
And certain restorers say that one should moisten the tents in butter, and change them each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they must be moistened in a confection of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent until the bone is strong, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes one puts goose feathers in the nose instead of tents, and a soft cloth around it, and it holds the fracture, and the patient blows through it; or do whatever you wish.
And if hot abscesses come to the nose while you are working there, put cerate or cotton moistened in rose oil, or a little diachylon there.
And if hot abscesses do not come there, put a plaster on top, of barley flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then put light tampons on top, and do not bind the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract it with instruments suitable for this, then sew the fissure, and treat it with things that generate flesh and heal, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead weights there, until it is healed.
When the jaw is broken underneath, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only underneath, and it is not broken in two, except perhaps splintered inside, one recognizes it easily.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, put your index finger of the right hand, and put the fracture back in place gently, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the fracture of the jaw is separated in two, it is necessary that you administer extension from two sides, until they are even.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or breakage, restrain them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then put cerate on the broken jaw, and put on a double bandage; and put on the bandage a well-made large star, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it on as much as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, unbind it on the third day, and then readjust what has changed; and put a plaster on, of mill powder with egg white or wheat flour, after you have removed the cerate;
and put light wool on the plaster, and if the plaster dries, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until it is healed; often it is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses come, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, observe if any piece of the bone is removed; if so, subtly remove it with the instruments suitable for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a blade according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound if it is wide, and apply suitable plasters to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The clavicle breaks many times in front, towards the shoulder, and the fracture is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure is, when the fracture is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken clavicle; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then set the fracture with your fingers, so that the form is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor shortening.
And if you need to extend further, then place under the patient's shoulder a round bolster of cloth, or of wool, and let it be thick according to your need; and extend and lift the clavicle, and pull the bolster with your hand, so that you set the fracture evenly, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the clavicle outwards, because it is deeply embedded, then it is necessary that the patient lie often on his back, and place under the shoulder a medium-sized pillow, and let the assistant push the shoulder down, until the bone of the clavicle is raised.
And then set the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it shattered, then you must split it open;
and draw the pieces out gently, and if the bone cannot join because of some obstacle, then cut it with one of the knives that you have; but that you place under the clavicle this instrument, to protect the viscera:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not pointed, and should be as wide as is necessary, according to the size of the bone and the difficulty of the operation;
and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the opening of the wound that you have made when you drew out the bones;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, cut the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with cloths and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses appear, moisten a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The reduction of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you apply to the bone a plaster of mill dust and egg white, and apply light lint over it, and place a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very wide bandage, a palm wide, then put a double cloth over the lint, and the plaster; then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage is hanging; and place the splint on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the affected armpit; and tighten it on each side, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the splint does not move on the broken bone, then observe it every day, and when the bandage loosens, then tighten it;
and make the patient lie on his back, and place a small pillow under the armpit while he sleeps, to raise the shoulder; this will lighten the fracture of the clavicle by lightening the shoulder, or you bind his arm to his neck, and do not unbind it unless a bad accident occurs, up to twenty days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that it is needed, and tighten it and leave it so, until it is healed;
and it is healed in at most twenty-eight days, and in less in some men.
Of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks either broadly or in the middle, and it is not known except by touch;
then set it according to the shape of the fracture, and reset it according to its natural form, in every way that you can;
then put on the place powdered millstone with abundant egg white, and light linen bandages, and put on a double cloth; then put on a broad and thin splint, a little larger than the shoulder, and if under the splint the hair is sticking out in any place of the shoulder, then fill that hair with linen bandages, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it all with a strong bandage firmly, so that the splint does not move from its place, and examine the bandage each day;
and every time that it loosens, then bind it, and make the splint even if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on his side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five.
And when this number is complete, then unbind it, and be certain, for it is not a bone that easily comes out of place.
And if a piece of the bone sticks out, and points below the heart, then cut it, and remove it, and do what we have said in the fracture of the collarbone to soothe a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breast
The breast is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it slopes downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and coughing, and perhaps vomits blood, and the hair appears in the broken bone, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and a cushion is placed between his shoulders, then press the shoulders, and bring together the ribs of the two ribs with your hands, and subtly put it evenly in all the ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put on plasters and tampons on top of the subtle layer of salt, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage round to the back, and tighten it properly, and check every hour the bandage, and if it softens, tighten it;
and if it is necessary to untie it, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or abscess, hasten, and untie it, and remove the plaster, and treat what has come there with methods of treatment;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs only happens in thick places behind the back, and in the front, and they only bend because they are slippery; and one feels it well upon examination with the fingers.
And the restoration is that you set the fracture evenly, as is necessary. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need to.
And if the rib fracture is inward leaning, the patient feels very great pain, and a stabbing, as with pleurisy, because the bone pierces the lung; and breathes with difficulty, and quickly vomits a great deal of blood, and this is a serious condition, and the ancients have devoted great skill to it.
And some say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest hot abscesses form there, if they have not already formed. And if they have formed, then treat them.
And some say that one places cupping glasses on the area, to strongly suck, and this seems reasonable; however, there is doubt that the cupping glass might attract superfluities to the area due to the weakness of the disposition.
And some say that one should cover the area with wool soaked in warm oil, and place tents between the ribs to evenly distribute the binding around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels such great pain that he cannot bear it, due to the bone piercing the flesh, and the patient is in doubt, then it is necessary to incise above the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the viscera;
and then one should cut the bone, and pull gently, and then stitch the two lips of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess appears, then apply cloths soaked in rose oil to the area;
and treat the area in the meantime as is necessary for an abscess, and let him lie often on the side where it should be, until it is healed.
and also in the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, observe if you see his hands softened and swollen and lifeless, and he cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, he does not feel it.
Know that he is mortally wounded in many ways, and if he moves them and feels well when they are pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if care is taken.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, observe if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms are there that are in the hands, and on the back there is flatulence and involuntary defecation;
and when he is turned on his stomach, there is involuntary defecation. And when he is turned on his back and wants to sit up, he cannot. Know that he is mortally wounded: do not labor in his treatment.
And if these symptoms do not occur, the condition is less serious.
And the treatment is that you observe if there is a hot abscess, then apply rose oil or egg yolk oil to it, until it is calmed;
then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on that part where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut over the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the cow", if you put your left thumb there, and set it even with the other, as well as you can, then apply the plaster and the bandage over it, if you need it;
then pull it out, and if there is a separated bone, then cut it open, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it does happen, it is only a slight lessening at the head; and it splits lengthwise, and inclines inwards, and the patient feels pain in the place, and a pricking, and the broken part swells.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand upwards, until you are over the fracture; and know what is the fracture and its form;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then set the fracture evenly, until it is of natural form.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it inclines inwards, then make the patient lie on his stomach, until the setting of that fracture is prepared for you. And when you have set it evenly, then apply the plaster, then place a splint of wood or horn, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, until the binding is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on his healthy side, or on his back.
And if hot abscesses occur there, do not touch them until the hot abscesses are subsided, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as is necessary, if there is no bad accident;
Of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder joint is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, then one must restore it according to one of two methods:
one of which is that you take a straight piece of wood of moderate thickness, according to this form:
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them upwards, and let the patient sit on a seat;
then place his broken arm on the wood, until it reaches the armpit, and have a curve of wood in the middle, then hang on something heavy or let the attendant stretch it downwards;
then let the physician set the fracture equal with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that one suspends the patient on his bed, and ties his hand to his neck, then commands two attendants that one hold above the fracture with his hands, and the other hold below with a linen cloth, and each stretch on his side.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, pull one linen cloth from below the fracture, and above the fracture, and let each of the attendants stretch on his side.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, then you must place one linen cloth in the middle under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, then you must place a linen cloth lightly, without effort, until the fracture is even on the place, and on the elbow;
then set the fracture evenly, as is necessary, and pull it, if hot abscesses do not appear.
And if hot abscesses appear, do not pull it until seven days, and apply wool moistened in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscesses are calmed;
then pull it, and the manner of pulling is that you place the plaster on the fracture, then assemble the arm to the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and place the cloth, and pull on the shoulder and on the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you doubt that the bone might move, use splints, and place on the fracture a splint wider and stronger than the others, and let there be one finger's breadth of space between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it surpasses the fracture by three fingers on each side;
then pull on the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less so in moving away.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, at the time that you restore the broken limb, and you doubt a hot abscess, then let it be bound until the seventh day, as we have said;
then examine every three days the binding, that itching or swelling does not come there, or that nourishment cannot come to the limb because it is too tight. If so, correct it, as we have said.
And if no such accident occurs, then do not unbind it except after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and have his hands on his stomach;
and place under the shoulder a cushion full of wool evenly, and check every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bindings are not loosened;
then correct it by the power of medicine, and give him the food that we have mentioned before, in such a way that the food is at first light; and when he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be healed in forty days altogether; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointments to heal the place.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it takes fifty days or two months to unbind.
Of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "foscile," of which one is small, and it is the one that follows the wrist;
and the other is large, and it is the one that is below, towards the little finger;
by chance the large foscile alone is broken, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small foscile is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when both are broken together.
If it is the small foscile that is broken alone, then it is necessary to extend it slightly, and to set it even.
And if it is the large foscile, then it must be pulled more strongly;
and extend it on a cushion, and hold the little finger of the hand higher than the others, and the little toe lower than the other toes, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and a cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient suffers no pain;
then let the attendant extend his arm to the part below his hand, or to a ligature, and another attendant to the other above.
And then let the physician set it even, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture there are pieces, then put each one in its place, and if there is any separated that touches the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter; then take care of it.
And if at the beginning of the resetting, hot abscesses appear, then glue a cloth of cerate made of rose oil and white wax, that is neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the cloth on subtly, until the hot abscesses are calmed.
And then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster of the mill powder with plenty of egg, then apply the splints, and let the splint of the fracture always be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and pull more above the fracture than elsewhere, and always less in moving away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad accident occurs to the limb, such as itching which comes to the limb, then you must bathe the limb with warm water, until that itching is calmed;
and do not let the limb rest tightly.
And then recommence the binding, and if the binding is loosened and the bone separated, and similar things, then redress it.
And then take care if nourishment cannot reach the limb, because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it so for a few days, until nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not unbind it until twenty days.
or around, then hang his hands around his neck, and let his neck be straight, and beware of movement and fidgeting, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or in thirty-five, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and complexions of the humors.
Of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the knuckles of the fingers, few fractures occur, and only bending often happens there.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or bent, the patient must sit cross-legged, and sit straight in front of him evenly;
then place his hand on a flat surface, and let the physician extend the broken bones, and place them even, until they are well joined;
and apply the plaster and lint, if no abscesses form, then apply a splint according to the size of the area; and let it be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inside around the palm of the hand, make a sling of cloths, and instruct the patient to hold it to his broken palm; and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it, as is necessary.
And if the fracture is on the outside, then you must place one splint above, and another below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and tighten the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture occurs in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the thumb, set it straight, as is necessary; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and it will not move;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the index finger or one of the others, set it straight, and bind it with the healthy finger that is next; or you bind them all together in an I shape, which is worth more, or you place a splint on top, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and in the treatment of a hot abscess, and treat what comes of it, as I have said.
The thigh bone is often broken, and one sees it well when it turns front and back;
and the treatment is to tie one bandage above the break, and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant stretches his bandage to his part equally;
and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.
And if the break is close to the root of the thigh, let one of the bandages be towards the groin, and the other bandage below the break.
And also if it is close to the knee, then let the bandage be near the knee, and let the extension be below;
then let the surgeon set the bone straight with his two hands, until it is according to its natural form, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no abscess forms there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside, then return to your work and your treatment; The bandage is made in this manner.
You must wrap around the fracture a hard bandage doubled two or three times, and let the excess remain, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and place a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come to the top;
then turn the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the bone of the leg;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to make the tightening even, then begin to bind tightly three or four turns over the fracture; and the further up you go from the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then take hold of the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and the thigh, and tie the three splints that are above, then return below to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it thus, until neither abscess nor swelling nor anything similar appears. And if it occurs, then unbind it, and treat what has appeared, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that protrude, it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, then it is necessary to cut open the place, and pull it out; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are applied, as in the shoulder and arm;
nevertheless, in the restoration thus made the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of complexions.
Know that in the kneecap there is little fracture, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a crack, or a hole, and it happens with a wound, and without a wound, and this one feels well.
And the restoration is that one puts what is round equal to its two sides, as much as it can be assembled;
then put the plaster, and put a round bandage there, if you need it, and bind it as is necessary, then observe all the dispositions that we have said in other fractures, such as hot abscess and similar; then apply to each accident what it needs, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is called by right name "mustelz", and the other is called "foscile";
and the same fracture occurs as in the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm equally, and the work is completely the same. And if the two bones are broken together, the leg turns in every direction.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and one sees it well; and it turns downwards.
Then administer extension, and set it straight, and bind the splints equally;
but however, if the fracture is severe, and there are many pieces, the extension must be less and lighter; and lighten it according to your ability.
And when you have completed your work, take two wooden splints that encompass the leg on either side, and are the length of the leg from the knee downwards;
then wrap around in two places a bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle as well, and with this binding the leg cannot deviate to the right or left, and thus it is well;
and some administer a splint the length of the leg, which is made of wood, and into which the leg is placed to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other complication; then treat it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle, a fracture does not occur, but at the bones of the foot, a fracture sometimes occurs and at the toes also, and nothing else happens except a bruise in several situations.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, then have the patient place their foot on the ground, as if they wanted to walk, and then immediately place your foot on theirs, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their place;
then apply the plaster and lint, and place under the sole of the foot a small board two finger-widths wide, then bind it to the foot tightly, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether fractured or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then place on the broken toe a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board that I have mentioned, and bind it tightly;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, then place on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it be resting on the head of the board above the instep, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other fractures, as we have said; and treat each accident as is necessary.
of the fracture of the bone of the wrist
When the bone of a woman's hip is broken, make her sit upright, then incline her towards her back, and let her be held from behind;
then fill the hip of the patient with cotton, and put in it as much as it will hold;
then stand the woman up, and raise her back little by little, and then the cotton will jump, until it comes to the entrance of the hip, and the bone will return with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, replace it, and do this for seven days or thereabouts: the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a chain to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the hip; then blow strongly into the chain, until the bladder is inflated inside; the hip will thus return to its place;
then it should be filled with cotton, and leave it thus for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man's or woman's wrist is broken, restore it as we have said for the hip bone;
and these fractures are not hidden from one who studies and practices them, and who attends to my book.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the right path to restoration: understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's gullet and put the penis in it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or so, and it will be healed quickly.
of fracture with wound
It is necessary for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that it be healed immediately, as the healings that we have mentioned testify.
And if the wound heals, staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the fracture at that same time, or that day, if hot abscesses do not come.
And if hot abscesses appear, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscesses are calmed, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause bad consequences.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the uncovered surface, it is necessary that you put it in place lightly with your hands, with slight extension.
And if extension is not sufficient to set it in place with your hands, then reset it with this iron instrument, which is seven or eight fingers long, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this reason it is necessary for the surgeon to have three or four, according to what he needs for each treatment of a fracture;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under compression on the limb during your work, and let it be pointed in front, and thick from the middle forward, thus:
And it is called a "palanche," wherefore it is necessary that the curved head be placed on the head of the apparent bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and is even on both sides. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot well grasp the bone, then it is necessary that you cut the head of the bone, until the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot bring back the bone, as we have said, then cut it with an instrument suitable for this, either an incisor or a saw, as you are able;
then scrape that which remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reset, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place.
Then do so until it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in black styptic wine, and properly if it is in summer; and do not put on the wound cerote or anything else where there is oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption;
then administer splints when you have reset the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted with the fracture;
and many times foolish surgeons have done this, and have caused the patient either death or corrosion sometimes; and let the bandages be softer and smoother than for other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that a bad accident may occur, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, then you must not put splints on it; but wrap around it, instead of splints, hard cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming at the wound, remove what you have put on with wine, and apply a wound-healing ointment, such as tetrafarmacum ointment and similar ones.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, until it is healed and sound.
And it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but continues to produce pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, wherefore it is necessary that you probe the wound with a tent, and remove all those separated pieces which cause that pain.
And if a fistula forms in the place, or another kind of corruption, then it is necessary that you treat it, according to what was said in the preceding chapter.
And when the bone is broken, and open on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder, and other similar large members, do not remove it, for many times death results, but leave it until it festers;
perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
We often see them after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and it is an ugly thing to see the shape of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take care then if the wound is fresh: if you administer styptic medicines, such as aloes, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocol, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and put them on the wound in lint, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days;
and put them on the wound in lint, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days; and then unbind it, and begin another, until the inflammation is removed;
or you bind on a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the inflammation is already converted into hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut it, and remove the apparent excess; or you scrape it with a razor, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb which is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and thin afterwards, this happens for many reasons: one of which is that it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of a multitude of dressings; or because of too much movement, not at the right time; or because he has little blood in his body, so he is weak.
And the cure is that you make the patient eat, and make the body soft, until the blood is multiplied in him; and administer a bath, and give him joy and happiness;
then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch attracts great nourishment, and often water it with warm water, until the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
of the limb twisted after the healing When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bone is open, and the form of the limb is ugly, yet it does not lose its natural function:
do not believe the fools who say that one must break the limb anew, and many foolish physicians have done this in our land;
and this practice is condemned, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
however, if the knots and the twisting are fresh, it is necessary that they be bathed with warm water, or softening herbs be cooked, such as mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening plaster, such as well-made diaquilón, and you take the mucilage of mallow, and cook it with chicken fat or linseed oil, and make a plaster on top;
or you take ripe figs, and crush them with flaxseed, and similar medicines that soften the swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by continuously and long rubbing with moist hands. And let movement be given to the limb every hour.
And if the tortuosity is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut to the bone, with a sharp, light incisor; and put skill and care into the treatment.
Dislocation is the departure of a joint from its place, because of which it cannot move, and the limb is misshapen, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When a dislocation occurs in someone, it must be immediately reduced without delay.
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps one resets it with difficulty;
therefore it is not fitting that one move it at the time that it is swollen: many times it causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave him until the abscesses are subsided;
then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as the treatment comes to its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
It happens that the jaws are dislocated on both sides, and the dislocation of both is according to two ways: or they are a little removed from their places, and softened a little; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the breast, and saliva runs from the mouth that he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled with speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns by itself in several positions.
And if it is complete and accomplished, then you must reset it quickly, and not delay;
and in such a way that the assistant holds the head of the patient, and puts his middle finger of one of his hands in the root of the dislocation of the jaw inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on two sides; and the other two fingers of the hands should be outside, to make it even;
and instruct the patient to relax his jaws, and move them in all directions. And the middle finger places it evenly, until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if it is the two jaws together, then warm them with warm water and oil, until they are slightly softened;
do not delay in the reduction, as we have said.
And when they are reduced evenly, and the patient's mouth closes well without softening, then apply cloths moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on his back, and his head be placed between two cushions, so that he does not move it either to the right or to the left, nor does he strain to chew, but takes light food, until the pains are removed, and the jaws are healed;
and then he may eat what he wants lightly, and does not strain to open his mouth to eat and drink, until the jaw is well healed and sound.
And if the two jaws cannot be set at once, and are not returned to their places, then fevers and customary swelling result, and perhaps looseness of the bowels, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is a loss; and many times he who it happens to dies within nine days.
The clavicle cannot be dislocated inwards towards the continuation of itself and the breast, and is sometimes dislocated outwards, and this is easily felt.
And the reduction is such that the patient lies often on his back, and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply the plaster and bandage it, and bind it tightly;
and the shoulder which is towards the ribs cannot be dislocated; except perhaps a little, and if it dislocates sometimes, then reset it in its place, as we have said;
then apply the plaster and bandage it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and in the same way is the shoulder joint reset, when it is separated from its place.
Of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated in only three ways:
one is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and by chance it dislocates to the upper part, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind the shoulder, nor does it dislocate inwards towards the nerves;
and many times it dislocates below towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in these it jumps quickly;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And by chance it happens to some men that there is a percussion or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated because of this.
It is necessary then that you test it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is lowered towards the armpit, and it shows a difference between the affected shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a manifest difference between them; and you will find at the head of the shoulder a hollow, and under the armpit, by touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it manifestly by touch;
and this type of dislocation is not difficult to reset, when it is recent, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the attendant raises the hand of the patient upwards, then places his thumbs under the armpit, and forcefully raises the joint upwards into place; and the attendant raises the hand and extends it upwards, then puts it downwards; it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then the patient must be bathed in warm water; and the attendant should apply a softening and soothing poultice, such as a decoction of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
then let the patient be placed on his back, and a wool pad of equal thickness, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit, then the physician should place his heel on the pad, and raise the head of the shoulder skillfully, and pull the patient's hand;
and another attendant should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you wish, reset it in this manner:
and it is that you have a man present who is larger than the patient; and let him stand straight towards the side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another attendant pull the patient's hand downwards towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, let him hang with some heavy thing, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and that is, one sticks a long firebrand into the earth, of which the head should be as round as a pestle, and neither too thick nor too thin; then it should be placed under the patient, but that he has soft cloths on top, and the patient should be standing along the length of the stick;
then let his hand be pulled down forcefully from the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a firebrand two arms long and four fingers wide, which has a round head to enter deeply under the armpit, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths on the head of the stick, so that the stick does not injure the patient, then place it under the armpit of the patient;
and extend his arm along the length of the stick, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm at the head of the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of suitable width, and let the hands hang down, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint will return in place immediately.
And when it is in place, in whatever manner that may be, you must place under the armpit an equal amount of wool, then apply the prepared plaster of mill dust, with incense and egg white, over the whole shoulder and around it, then bind it tightly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to the neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place because of moisture that has entered, or for another reason, you must apply cautery to three points, as is explained in the chapter on cautery.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocations towards the armpit, and the breasts, or the back, are caused by an impact and stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered there;
and treat until it is healed.
And if after healing stiffness comes to the limb, and slowness in movement, then let the patient use a bath many times, until that stiffness is alleviated, and returns to its former nature.
of the dislocation of the rib
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated with difficulty, and returns with difficulty;
and it is dislocated on all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not hidden, for one sees it well and feels it well; and dislocated according to each form. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is dislocated, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder at all.
And you must reset it before hot abscesses develop there, for if hot abscesses should come there, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps it cannot be reset at all, especially when it is in the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and perhaps death ensues.
And the restoration is, when it is such that one can reset it, that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms should be spread out, and the hands of the physician should be placed around, above and below, and put the joint to its places together, or at the root of the palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushes from the root of the palm on the joint which is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, administer strong extension;
and that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm on each side, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth;
and when the physician feels the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint strongly, until it returns;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it tightly, and hang the arm around the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, untie the binding, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not hold well, redo the plaster and the binding, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if he feels stiffness after the resetting of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is soothed; or you put on the joint a poultice of fat mutton, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and make it enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then put the poultice back on, and then enter the bath; and thus do it two or three times, until he is healed;
and if you wish, put on warm, moist cow dung with butter, and bind it on;
then it will return to its proper position.
The dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is easier than other joints. However, it must be returned to its place quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the place swells, or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction is that you place the affected hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and you place it evenly, so that he places his palm on the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, you must check if it is well in place; then the patient places the back of his hand on a table for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient places the back of his hand on the table, and you place your hand on that appearance of the joint.
If it returns now, it is well. If not, restrain it with soothing plasters, warm poultices, and leave it thus without restarting.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it back in place after some days, the joint remains twisted;
and it harms the patient nothing except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerves are cut, or the artery;
there is no other remedy except to cauterize near the injury, and perhaps nothing else will help.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it so.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, then bathe it in warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly;
then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then set it even on that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it at night;
and do this often, until it is tight, and do likewise, if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do likewise, when it is dislocated elsewhere.
of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or of the neck is dislocated, or there are several dislocated, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.
And the sign is that the excretions leap forth without will, nor can he hold them, and often some limbs are weakened, either the two thighs or the two arms or one.
And many times the spine moves in four directions;
that which moves to the rear is called "gibbosity":
The cure is that you consider if the gibbosity came from infancy: if there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or from impacts or similar things, the ancients said cures by great words, where there is not in all great profit;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in diverse manners.
I say that in the gibbosity that comes to the breast before, there is no device or health;
and also that which comes straight on two sides, and one cannot cure except that which comes properly to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient be stretched on his face in a level place, and have a cushion beneath him, that he not be bruised;
then stick one firebrand firmly in the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie one rope across the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants hold the ropes, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two firebrands;
and they are well fastened, the firebrands as we have said, and the physician places his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient be on his side, and put the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician put his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a winch that turns by hand. And it is that you insert two firebrands at the head of the patient a cubit apart, and towards the feet two others, and let there be between each firebrand, above and below, a palm's breadth of space lengthwise;
and let there be in each firebrand one hole where the winch runs, and let the firebrands be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move;
and between each two firebrands let there be one turning firebrand, on which the ropes turn, and let there be on the two turning firebrands two small firebrands a palm's length long, to turn the winch;
and then tie the rope which is through the armpits to the winch towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other winch, and each of the assistants turns his winch with all the rope, and the master places the spine evenly as we have said.
And when it is even, then apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then the lint, and then the splint of a tablet three fingers long, which covers the area of the gibbosity and the part of the healthy vertebra, then bind it with a rope, as we have said, and the patient uses a light diet until he is healed;
and if anything comes at the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned above; and sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance comes in the last vertebra of the back, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone which appears, wherefore one should not be presumptuous: by chance it would bring about death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and at the joints of the shoulder there comes forth only dislocations, and it does not come there as in the other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward than elsewhere, and little dislocated forward and backward.
And the recognition of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the diseased leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the diseased knee is more open than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee to the fire; and the place which is nearby is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of that which comes outwardly, is that these accidents are contrary to those above.
And the signs of that which happens in front, are that he extends his leg well according to its length; nevertheless, he does not bend his knee without pain, and if one wants to make him walk, he cannot go forward, and he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
And the signs of him to whom it happens behind, are that he cannot extend his knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you observe if the dislocation is old, and if it remains according to its disposition, there is no cure; and it is not necessary that there be presumption.
And in the one whose dislocation is fresh, and this is of the four types of dislocation, hasten that you turn the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and to the left; by chance it will return, and needs no other treatment.
And if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a linen band that is tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a way that he puts his hands under his armpits, then binds him with a soft linen band above the thigh; and another holds the head of the linen;
and they extend up and down all at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to the four similar [cases], and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is well.
If not, then one must apply a treatment similar to it.
When the dislocation is inward, you must place the patient on his healthy side, then place the linen on the root of the thigh, and the place which is under the groin, then extend the linen upward toward the groin, and toward the collarbone;
then let another assistant take his arms, and embrace the large part of the affected thigh, and extend it strongly outward; then it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than others.
And if you cannot set it in the manner we have described, you must bind the patient's two feet together with a strong, soft linen above the two heels and above the two knees, and let the affected leg be extended two fingers more than the other;
then let it be hung from the end of a beam, and let it be two arm-lengths above the ground;
then instruct an assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who firmly embraces the thigh, for the joint returns immediately in this way.
And when the dislocation is outward, let the patient lie down, as we have said for someone with gibbosity, and tightly bind a linen cloth above the affected leg properly, and above the foot as well;
then place two firebrands, one at the head and another at the feet, then insert a firebrand between the patient's thighs in the middle of the groin; and have moistened cloths placed around, so that it does not burn the patient, then let each assistant extend towards him, and let the physician put the dislocation in place with his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, put it on a table, and press it as we have said in the case of gibbosity, and let the patient lie on the healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and let the physician put his effort on the affected angle, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the affected limb downwards, or lift it from the ground, but it should be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said about lying on the two hips; and let him be on his face, and the limb extended as we have said before, and one should press on the joint against the table; and it will be in place when the patient extends his legs, and they are equal; then bring the thighs together, and apply the plaster, and bind it tightly with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and let it rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are equal, then bind it as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and have him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
Of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not bend to his thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend his leg if he can, and place your back against his face, and place his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and pull it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he bends his leg easily to his thigh;
and apply the plaster, and bind the leg to the thigh, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and the patient should not exert himself to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not straight, administer strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes moved, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inwards and outwards.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and more so on the side where it is dislocated:
The reduction is easy, and one should gently extend it with one's hands when it is only moved.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and hold him/her, and pull forcefully on the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left twice, then extend it upwards, and gently put the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot;
If it returns, it is good;
If not, then recommence the procedure, for it will return;
and if it cannot return thus, then have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly stick a stake in the ground between his thighs, and tie cloths around it, so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a rope, which he ties above the ankle; then let each assistant extend equally, and the stake should always be between the patient's thighs to restrain the patient when he is extended;
then let the physician equally set the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, then apply the plaster and lint, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves which are on the ankle behind, that the binding not be too tight;
then leave it two or three days, and if the binding loosens, then tighten it;
then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot abscesses come, then you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without force, and that is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any knot of the back of the foot, then you must make the patient sit on a flat place or on a table perfectly straight, and put your foot on what appears of those joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
and when it is even, and nothing appears there, then place a two-legged board under the sole of the foot, then bind it firmly, and leave it for three days, then unbind it; and make him rest until he is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and you have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, not hasty;
and use at the beginning soothing things for a hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you see no hope of health; and when you see hope, then immediately reset the limb, before the hot abscesses come there;
and when the limb is in place, then administer things soothing to a hot abscess, and treat the wound, as is fitting, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then remove them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
and guard yourself from entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for it is worthwhile for you according to your Creator, and for the safety of your soul and your body.
