The treatment with fire by iron (cautery)
There is another type of disease which is called "corrodens," and it is nothing other than a consumption of the limb, for it eats away at the limbs as fire does dry wood.
If you see this disease in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat cauteries, both small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place where the disease is; then cauterize it on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupted is removed. 
And then leave it for three days, and apply on the cauterized areas ground sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
Afterwards treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh is not growing, that's good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And this affliction has sometimes been treated with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery; but nevertheless fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already explained the treatment with the sharp medicine in the section: take it when you need it.
