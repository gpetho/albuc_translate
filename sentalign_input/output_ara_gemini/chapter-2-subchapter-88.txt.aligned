Chapter eighty-eight on the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medications.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-EIGHT. On the treatment of sinuses and the way to irrigate them.	0.7545644
If a swelling occurs in some fleshy member and the duration of the swelling is prolonged until it gathers pus, then bursts or is lanced and all the pus within it comes out and the place remains empty like a vessel, and the skin on it, like a rag, has thinned, and its corruption has not reached the point of affecting bone, nerve, or ligament, for this reason it deserves to be called a 'hidden' (mukhaba'), and it is not called a fistula unless its duration lengthens until the corruption affects something from these members, then at that time it is called a fistula or zakama.	When an abscess occurs in any of the fleshy parts and becomes chronic and eventually collects pus, and then it breaks open or is perforated, and all the contained matter comes out and the site is left hollow, like a vessel, and the overlying skin thinned like a rag, but the suppuration has not gone so far as to involve bone or tendon or ligamentâ€”and hence it merits the name of 'sinus' and is not called a fistula. But if it goes on until the disease involves any of these parts it is then called a fistula or defluxion.	0.87889165
And its treatment is to cut that whole skin as it goes around, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption. But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and the corruption in it has not reached that extent, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an injection.	The treatment of it will be to cut away all that skin with a circular incision; specially if it be thinned and has become like a rag, and you are sure that it will not adhere to the place, because of its corruption. But if you are in hope of its adhering, and the corruption has not reached that point, and there is in the skin some thickness of flesh, then treat it by irrigation.	0.910995
And that is, you look at the hidden (mukhaba'), and if it is large and the pus that flows from it has a foul odor, inject it with the Egyptian medicine which is vinegar, oil, honey and verdigris, equal parts, gathered in a vessel, and cooked on the fire until the medicine thickens and comes to the thickness of honey.	The procedure is that you examine the sinus, and if it be large and the purulent discharge from it smell bad, then irrigate it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, honey and verdigris, equal parts of each, mixed in a vessel and heated on the fire until the compound thickens and assumes the consistency of honey.	0.73599595
Then take your need of it, and thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the hidden (mukhaba') and bind its mouth and leave the medicine in it for about two hours, then remove it by squeezing, do this for days until the hidden (mukhaba') is cleansed and the foul odor goes away.	Then take as much as you need and dilute it with water and honey, and with this irrigate the sinus and bind up the opening, leaving the compound inside for two hours. Then get it out by pressure. Do this for several days until the sinus is clean and the smell disappears.	0.7857883
It may be injected with ash water if you don't have this medicine available.	It may be irrigated with water of ashes if the medicine is not at hand.	0.8874079
And that is, you take the ash of vine wood or the ash of oak wood and pour water on it, then filter it and inject it with it until you are certain that the hidden (mukhaba') has been washed.	For that, you take ashes of vine or of oak, and put water upon them; then clarify the liquor and with it irrigate the sinus until you are sure it is thoroughly clean.	0.70947194
If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then inject him with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed, or inject him with honey and wine mixed, because it is the nature of honey to cleanse and wash, and wine adheres to the hidden (mukhaba'), especially if the wine has extra astringency and dryness.	But if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the water of ashes, then irrigate him with water and honey with which a little pounded verdigris has been mixed; or irrigate with honey and wine mingled; the value of the honey lies in its cleansing and washing, while the wine closes up the sinus, specially if it be a wine which has some dryness and astringency.	0.886614
So if you do that several times, and you are certain that the corruption of the hidden (mukhaba') has gone, inject it with something that grows flesh in it, such as taking some of the palm ointment and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine, or injecting it with some of the other medicines and ointments whose properties we established in the article on ointments.	When you have done this several times and you are sure that the sinus is clean of diseased matter, then irrigate it with those compounds that will encourage granulation in it. For example, you may take a little Palm ointment and dissolve it in oil of roses and some astringent wine; or irrigate it with some of the other ointments and medicines whose prescriptions we have recorded in the treatise on ointments.	0.778285
As for the one on the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba'), it is the one that you remove every time, so that the pus gathered in it comes out, and so you know what flows from it of pus, whether it is much or little, or mature or immature.	But the dressing over the sinus opening you may constantly remove, so that the pus collected behind it may come out and so that you may know whether there be much or little ichor, and whether digested or not.	0.6076382
And with this also, inspect the site of the hidden (mukhaba') itself, whether its owner feels pain in it or there is no pain in it, and whether there is swelling in it or there is no swelling in it.	And at the same time investigate the site of the sinus itself to see whether the patient feels any pain in it or no pain, and whether there be any swelling in it or not.	0.69292927
So if your treatment proceeds in this way, and you see that the substance that comes out is slight on the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba'), then know that the hidden (mukhaba') has adhered or is close to adhering, so then loosen it tomorrow or on the third day, and when you loosen the wound, replace the cloths with others and renew the ointment.	Then when your treatment has reached such a point that you see that there is only a little superficial matter coming out round the mouth of the sinus, you may know that the sinus has closed up or is near to closing up. Then you may unbandage it the next day or the third day, and when the wound is unbandaged make a change of dressing and ointment.	0.7500368
If thin pus comes out of the hidden (mukhaba') after a long time, do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is near, because among people some have slow flesh growth in their wounds and some the opposite of that.	But if, after a long while, the sinus discharges a thin ichor, do not despair of its closing up, for its healing is near. For there are some men whose wounds are slow in healing, and some are the opposite.	0.7235111
If immature pus comes out of the hidden (mukhaba') after many days, know that the hidden (mukhaba') has not adhered. If the adherence of the hidden (mukhaba') is slow and its matter prolonged, increase the drying of the medicines, and let the medicines be moist in their consistency and dry in their potency, such as the palm ointment if an extra amount of qalqatar has been added to it.	If, after many days, undigested pus is discharged you may know that the sinus has not closed. If the closing of the sinus be delayed and it be a long affair, make the medicines dryer; let them be medicines that have some humidity in their substance but dryness in their potency, such as Palm ointment with the addition of excess of rock-alum.	0.74426216
And among the most effective things that it is treated with is that the palm ointment is taken and dissolved with rose oil and the aged wine, moderate in its consistency, is sprinkled on it, then you knead it with it and use it.	A most efficacious treatment is to take Palm ointment and dissolve it in oil of roses and sprinkle over it old wine of even consistency. Then knead together, and use that.	0.8421972
And a similar action may be done, if the palm ointment is not available to you, with honey, if you cook it until it thickens and use it, or you take myrrh, aloe and frankincense, and grind all of it and sprinkle it on the honey while it is on the fire, then spread it on a cloth and bind it on the hidden (mukhaba'), or spread on it honey that you've cooked until it thickens, and sprinkle the drugs on it, and place the cloth on it and bind it.	The same sort of thing may be done with honey if you have no Palm ointment at hand; if you heat the honey to a thick consistency and use that; or take myrrh and aloes and incense of juniper and beat them all up together and sprinkle on the honey while it is heating on the fire, spread on lint and bind over the sinus; or spread on it honey heated to a thickness, and over that sprinkle powdered aromatic roots, and over these place a dressing that you bandage on.	0.83110535
And long ziravand, the root of the German iris, cress flour and centaury may be used in such a case, whether you use them singly or combined, you grind them, sift them, and sprinkle them on the honey I described and use it.	Sometimes also in a case of this sort long birthwort and the root of the blue iris and vetch flour and centaury are usable, either separately or mixed, beaten up together, sifted and scattered into honey as I described; use them thus.	0.77440083
If the matter of the hidden (mukhaba') is prolonged and it does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth and it has affected the bones or the rest of the hard nerves or ligaments, so treat it with the treatment of the fistula as described above.	But if the sinus be chronic, and it does not heal with this treatment, then you may know that there is corruption at the bottom of it, which has affected the bones or motor nerves or ligaments; the treatment then is that of fistula as already given.	0.6913799
