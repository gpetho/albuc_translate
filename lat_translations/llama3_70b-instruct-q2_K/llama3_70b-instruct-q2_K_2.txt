Praefatio.	Foreword.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I had completed for you, my sons, this book which is the final part of the science of medicine with its complement, and I had reached the end in it, from its expositions and declarations, it seemed good to me to complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation with the hand was neglected in our region and time, and was completely forgotten; so that perhaps the knowledge of it perished, and its investigation was cut off; and there did not remain any of it except for small descriptions in ancient books, which were altered by hands: and error and hesitation occurred among them, until their intentions were closed and its power was elongated. It seemed good to me to revitalize it with the arrangement of this Treatise, according to the method of positioning, declaration, and abbreviation; and to bring it together with the forms of cauterium and other instruments of operation: so that it would be done through added declarations, and through proper preparation of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good craftsman with his hand is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long and it is necessary for its author to be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen described, so that he may know the juices of the members, and their forms, and their connections, and separations, and have knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and ligaments, and their number, and their egressions, and of the pulsating veins, and quiet ones, and the exit places of these.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with a work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken about it in the introduction of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since one who is not knowledgeable about what we said about anatomy will not be cautious, and already falls into error, whereby humans are harmed: just as I have seen many of those who boast about this science without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened was that a certain foolish doctor cut into a scrofulous apostem on the neck of a woman, and he severed some arteries in her neck; as a result, the woman's blood flowed out, until she fell dead at his feet.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who attempted to extract a stone from a man's bladder, which had been causing him pain for a long time, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He approached him therefore, and extracted it with a fragment of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	As a result, the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I was indeed already called in to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the sick man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who received a stipend from a certain Duke of our land because of his medical skills: and it happened to a black eunuch who was in the Duke's service, that he suffered a fracture in his leg near the ankle; and the doctor, with his ignorance, tightened the fracture above the wound with poultices, and bandaged it strongly, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he abandoned him according to his despair.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards, he left him for several days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage; and it remained thus until his leg became infected and his foot, and it led to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called in therefore to him: and I proceeded to loosen the bandage: and calmness followed, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	But truly, the corruption had already taken hold in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So therefore the corruption ceased to spread through the limb, until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced a malignant ulcer: and it became infected after days, until the evil of his condition was manifest to him and his lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	What is, is that when it is a pure cancer from melancholic humor, then it is not suitable to be touched with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can tolerate it, so that the whole of it may be cut away.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of that, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, an operation associated with salvation, and an operation in which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already excitedly pointed out in every place of this book, where an operation comes up, which is accompanied by terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to dismiss it: so that you may not find a stupid way to speak about it, and to shame.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Take therefore the measure with solicitude and protection, and clothe your infirmities with facility and firmness, and walk in a better way leading to gratitude of God for salvation and laudable succession: and dismiss terrible difficulties of sanation: and lift your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may not creep over you in your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen indeed has already said in certain of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not heal the bad disease: lest you be named a bad doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On Cauterization with fire and Cauterization with acute medicine, chaptered and ordered from head to feet, and the forms of instruments, and the tools of Cauterization: and all that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On incision and perforation, bloodletting and venesection, and wounds: and the extraction of arrowheads, and similar things: and all chaptered, ordered in forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	The third chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	About restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things to that: a chapter, arranged from head to feet, and the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	About cauterization and burning: and with which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary that I describe the quality of its cauterizations and burnings: and in what complexions they are exhibited.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the discourse on the quality of cauterization and its burning is a profound and subtle science, a hidden and occult secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many wise men have also spoken about it, and they have disagreed about it; and for me, a little of their discourses is enough, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that cauterization is universally beneficial to every complexion, which is with matter and without matter, except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter and the dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	But in the hot and dry complexions with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that cauterization is beneficial in them.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, namely that cauterization is not suitable for the ailment which arises from heat and dryness: because the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable to be healed from a hot and dry ailment with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who spoke against him said: that through cauterization there is a remedy for every hot and dry ailment that occurs in the bodies of men: because when you compare the body of man and its humidity to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I certainly say this through his discourse: because from experimentation he has already revealed to me that same thing many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not suitable to proceed with that unless one has already been tested and exercised in the last chapter of Cauterii's exercise, and has recognized the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the space of time of those things.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the remaining complexions, there is no fear concerning you: and especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have agreed on these things: and they did not disagree with Cauterius in their judgment concerning them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And you should know, son, that the secret of healing through Cauterium with fire and its goodness is superior to Cauterium with medicine combining to burn: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach, unless to the member that is cauterized: and it does not harm another member connected to it, except by a small injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	On the other hand, the action of medicine combining to burn reaches to that which is extended from the members: and perhaps it causes difficulty in healing an illness in a member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it is in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now that has been known to us through experience, because of the length of service and study with art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I excuse myself from the length of the sermon.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted in this book of mine, I would bring to you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies for expelling their own illnesses, which drives out diseases through philosophical demonstration, which would be clear to your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And you should know, son, that they themselves disagree on the time in which it is convenient to perform cauterization, and they set a better time for spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is suitable at all times; therefore, because the noxious thing which happens on account of the time is submerged in the inflammation, which is attracted with the cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if cauterization is due to pains from necessary painful things, strong, urgent, which do not tolerate delay: therefore because it is feared that a greater evil may occur, which is more than the small harm that enters on account of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let not that fall into your minds, O sons, that which they do not expect, unless it is the common and foolish doctors, namely that those diseases which are healed by cauterization are not always cured: and they put that consequence, and the thing is not as they think: therefore because cauterization is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters the temperament, and dries out the humidities which are the causes, whence pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization exceeds medicine by the speed of its healing, and the virtue of its operation, and the vehemence of its mastery: and it is possible that the disease may return at some time according to the temperament of the infirm person, and the location of their disease, and its virtue: and what is prepared in their body from the aggregation of superfluous things in it: and what reaches them in their acquisition from foods and similar things, unless there is a disease, in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle disease in a few members, with superfluity and humidity, such as cauterization of the tooth, on account of pain, and similar things, it is possible indeed, that the pain may not return to it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But it happens in a few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But indeed the common speech is wrong, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, it is a correct speech: not according to what they intend in that: because they believe that there is no cure which can be conferred with medicine, nor with another after the occasion of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The thing is contrary to that intention, and the purpose, which is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is not so, unless when we have administered modes of curation in some disease and they do not concur with those medicines: then we administer cautery at the end, and it is effective: therefore it falls out that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron: and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance: and they said that it does not produce pus at the site of the cautery.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	That is not absolutely true: because I have already tested it and found that it does not do so in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cautery with gold itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you ignite gold cautery in the fire, it is not declared to you, when it is ignited according to the quantity that you wish, because of the reddishness of the gold: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add ignition on top of it, it liquefies in the fire and turns into layers.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the craftsman falls away from that into occupation: and because of that, cautery with iron is more expedient and closer to us in terms of correctness for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have indeed already arranged this Chapter on Cautery according to chapters: and I have arranged those from head to feet, so that they may be of use to anyone seeking what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On the method of cauterying the Head in the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here cautery is beneficial for dominating humidity and coldness on the brain: which are two causes of swelling, and a multitude of fluxes of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain: and universally all diseases that occur from coldness, such as paralysis, and swelling, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar ones from diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is to prescribe for the weak: that he should be evacuated with a cleansing medicine on three or four nights, according to what the virtue of the weak person requires, and their age, and their habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have him sit between your hands in a square shape, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that place with a cautery.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the olive oil cautery: this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it (the cautery) on the marked spot with the incision, by descent, where your hand is slowly constricted, and you turn it around.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift your hand, and inspect the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that it has already been detached from the bone of the head or the quantity of zeuharbi, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat with the iron itself, or with another from the same if it is frozen: until you see the bones, which I have told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cotton in it, and place it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place on top of it a cotton soaked in butter, and leave it on the spot until the eschar (scab) is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the four-drug ointment, until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	Now I have said, that as long as the wound remains open, it emits pus: therefore it is better and more useful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something of the density of the bone is touched.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape away what is adhering to the bone, then cleanse.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to use a cautery to the utmost, until it makes an impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, just as if it were carved: or with an instrument which women use in embroidering small letters; and they think that vapors are released from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be cleansed, until it becomes consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But to me, these two types of cautery do not seem useful at all, except in certain men, according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it alone is better, in my opinion, with regard to his own health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is debilitated by the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified to in other members: and especially when the head of the weak person is naturally feeble: and indeed the first species of Cautery is safer and better, in my opinion, and I approve of it: therefore operate with it for health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Head 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head: and it is prolonged in the weak person, and he uses hieric, and cochials, and head-purging, and oils, and emplasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and nothing among those things is of benefit to him: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the weak person is strong by natural creation, and it is not feeble, and it finds a violent cold: then cauterize with another cautery under that a little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it above every horn of his head with a cautery, so that the skin does not perforate, and a quantity is disclosed from the bone, as we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And you should cauterize him with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place called "vas", and it is the place where a vein is located.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the weak patient finds relief from that severe pain, and it differs from the pain of other head cauteries.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say that this cautery is in its place, and it is necessary that it be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and his back of the head is more subtly cauterized than the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cautery on the half of the head, both with dry remedies and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Head 4.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur on the part of the head, or when the pain extends to the eye, and it is evacuated with cleansing remedies for the head, and the remaining treatment is administered, which I mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and that does not help at all: then cautery on it is according to two methods: either cautery with a sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cautery with a sharp burning medicine is that you take one garlic tooth, and scrape it, and remove the extremities from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then divide the painful area at the time of bleeding with a broad phlebotomy, until a place is made under the skin, where the density is captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	So introduce it then under the skin, until it is hidden; then bind above it with a decent constriction poultice, and leave it for fifteen hours; then remove it, and extract the garlic, and leave it for two days or three. Afterwards, put on top of it a submersed cotum in butter, until the place makes pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to do that with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on burning medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	But cauterization of it is with iron, and it is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Fire cauterization, whose form this is.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is named Clavulus; because the form of its head is like the form of a nail, in which there is a certain curvature, and in its middle there is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot, and hold your hand firm; and you rotate the iron slowly with velocity: and let the quantity that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, as its middle.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand, so that the artery, which is underneath, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a cloth in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then place the cloth with butter: afterwards treat with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicania with the second cauterization of the razor's edge.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting into the artery in this hemicania, not in the usual way.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in ancient hemicania.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat hemicania, with what we said from previous cures, and what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and the cure does not work: and you see from the illness that it is not sufficient for what we said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then it is necessary to ignite the razor-like cauterium, until it becomes white after placing a sign on the spot of pain with a line, whose length is the middle of the finger, or almost so: and put your hand in place of one, and hold it firmly until you reach the artery, and pass through to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jawbone, which moves during mastication, lest the lateral or neural nerve that moves it be injured, whence a spasm may occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this is above the cut, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery, which has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in the cutting of it there is fear, and especially for one who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent, nor experienced: and he leaves the operation with that at the beginning.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will describe with remembrance of the regulation of the flow of blood that occurs from the artery according to its own method, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	What if you see from the weakness, that this cauterization does not suffice for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, heal the wound, until it is healthy.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cauterization that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cauterizer having two cauteries.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterizing in the case of a gold-colored (or golden) ulcer.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When a golden ulcer occurs from cold, and it is treated with solutives, and the remaining cures which we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not disappear, then apply the cauterization: and it is that which is called a Punctum, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then apply the punctures with it after its ignition all around the circle of the ear, as it revolves: or around both circles, if there is pain simultaneously in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And extend yourself with the cauterizer from the root of the ear for a short time, after you have marked the places with an encaustic: and let the quantity of the cauterization be ten punctures on each ear, and as it is.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places that are ailing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cauterizing in the torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	A torture that is treated with cauterization is not except for those species which occur from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And there is a need for cauterization of the species that occurs from desiccation and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with hiera, and caputpurgation, and gargarism, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the affected part with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little below its own timpore, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And apply your cauterization to the opposite part of the affected area.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Since softening does not occur unless on a part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is, to apply the cautery directly to the upper extremity of the ear under the crown of the head a little; and another on the timpore, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until a moderate amount of thickness of the skin is burned away.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type from the scalpel, whose form has been described above: truly it is not more subtle than that, as you see; and it is necessary for the scalpel to be somewhat rough on the surface.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the places with what has preceded, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in ancient Apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When Apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on all the horns of his head, and a cautery in the middle of his head, as we have said, and a cautery at the back of his head, according to what has preceded: and the method of the cautery should be according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	They also cauterize with a branding iron on the stomach bone, and it is almost the last resort.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then they are cured, as if what had preceded did not exist.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Concerning the method of branding in obliquity.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is fitting that they should be given a drink first to the greatly infirm hysteria patients, and purging pills that cleanse the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then scrape the whole head of the patient, and apply to his occiput a plaster made from synapic descriptions in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This indeed is the method of branding; and do that second thing in order, which I mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore they are healed through that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make for him three brandings on the back of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and apply a thickness of a finger between each branding.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then heal the branding, as if what had preceded did not exist.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however there is an additional use, and the patient is tolerant of that: then make for him a branding in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	Which if there is an additional use: then brand him on the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then heal him, until he is cured: and let the branding be repeated according to the method which was previously mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Concerning the method of branding in paralysis and softening.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is fitting to proceed with cleansing the head along with hysteria, and with what we have mentioned.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then scrape the head of the patient; afterwards brand him with a branding iron in the middle of the head, and with a branding iron on each horn of the head, and with a branding iron on his back, and three on the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you find the patient in a state of softening of the body with many illnesses and he is weakened by tolerating them, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery until it burns most of his skin, and lift your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then treat him, until he is healed: and thus you will make the cautery of Olive oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	On the method of cauterizing in Epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Head 11.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	One should not cauterize an epileptic, unless he is one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	It is necessary therefore to cleanse his brain first with yawning, and with the rest of the treatment that we mentioned earlier: when he is greatly weakened or is tolerant of the reception of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If however he is a boy who does not tolerate medicines, then give him gargles and cleansing mastications of the brain, for many days beforehand with improvement of his food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery on the middle of his head, according to what was previously mentioned in the method: and with another cautery on the back of his head, and on all the horn-like projections of his head with a cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	What if he was strongly weakened and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I mentioned as having a paralyzed part, and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and back: and let the Olive oil cautery be according to the method that preceded.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	If however he is a weakened boy, then apply a subtle cautery, according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	On the method of cauterizing in Melancholy.
Caput XII.	Head 12.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I mentioned as having a paralyzed part.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excessive flow to the brain, and it is a humid body that is weakened, then give him in drink what purifies his brain, according to what was mentioned earlier in the division: next, shave the head of the weakened person, and afterwards make a compress made from linen, just like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then put it in the middle of the head: and let the weakened person sitting squarely hold it on all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply the plaster.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is better to use old butter or ancient oil.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And warm it over a tempered fire, a heat that the finger can bear, when it is inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate it in the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do that to the weakened person every week once, along with the rest of his good regime, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize him by making many small points, except what you hold in your hand with the cautery: namely, let it be fragrant.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this type of cautery humidifies the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then put on top a cloth soaked in butter, or the fat of a hen.

Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the principle of water in the eye is declared to you through signs, which I mentioned earlier in the division, then begin and give drink to the weakened person, with what purifies his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him away from all humidities, and make him sit in a bath, on fasting days for some time.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize himself in the middle of his own head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him on two temples with two cauteries, if there is a descent of water in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if there is a descent of water in one eye: and cut away with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in width on the temples: and beware of a flux of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see something coming out of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I commend the wisdom that is in the extraction of arteries, and in the cutting off of them, and in caution against a flow of blood.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And when it is cauterized on the vertebra, under two bones, with two ultimate cauters produced by the two bones.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in old wounds of the Lacrimal.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old and frequent, and they are above the veins and arteries which are manifestly on the outside of the head, it is believed that it is due to superfluous cold and phlegmatic humors; then cauterize with a cauter that I described in the chapter on descending waters, with a cauter in the middle of the head, and with two cauters above the temples, and with two cauters on the vertebra under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need additional treatment, then cauterize it on every side of the eye, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cauter.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the fetid Nose.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with what we said earlier in the division, and the treatment does not help; then prepare a potion of three nights for the weak-bodied ones; afterwards shave their head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized cauter, together with an oily cauter.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a hammer-shaped cauter, with two cauters above the eyebrows under the hair a little.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And be cautious of the artery, lest you wound it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the shape of the hammer-shaped cauter.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the softening of the Eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye becomes soft from sickness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cauter, together with this lunar-shaped cauter.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every part; and they will be elongated from the two temples; and let the length of the entire cauterization be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not extend your hand with the cauterization, but rather according to the quantity that is sufficient for the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of the cauterization according to this method of lunar cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing the eyelids when hairs are inserted, pricking painfully the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cauterization is in it according to two methods: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medication.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In cauterization with fire, however, beware of the weak one beforehand, so that he may let go his hairs, if they are among those who cleanse them, until they grow long and become equal.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, they prick him at the corner of his eye: then bind his eyes with a cloth, so that they are not moved, until they heal.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they have healed and become equal, then place the head of the weak one on your lap: next, mark above the eyelids of his eyes with encaustic, a mark that is according to the shape of the myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a cotton soaked in white egg; or in a mixture of psyllium on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then make a fire-cautery, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize above the shape that you marked gradually in many places, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of the myrtle leaf, appearing entirely proper.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the healthiness of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contracted, and hairs lifted up at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Raise your hand then, and leave it thus for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then put a cotton dressing with butter on it, until the scab is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If something returns from the pills after an hour, and the eyelid becomes softer: then apply a cautery to that place, just as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If the pills are on the lower eyelid: then cauterize it, until it returns to its natural place: and adjust it so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in this same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is necessary to prescribe for the patient that they let the hairs grow, until they are long and adjusted.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape from a piece of paper in the form of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from a known soap, and from a lime which has not absorbed moisture, one ounce or nearly that amount: then mix them together with good friction, and do it quickly, so that it does not cool down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread from the mixture upon the paper which you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it upon one eyelid or two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a cotton soaked in white egg; and let the patient's head be on your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And put your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a short time.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you move it as often as the patient feels the biting of the medicine: because he finds its biting like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore it perseveres, that is, the patient finds the biting, then leave the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid being elevated, just as it is elevated with a contraction or with an incision, it is good: and if not, then apply medicine on top of it to the place where the medicine does not penetrate, and is not rejected, until your operation is equalized, and the eye is constricted.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then put on top of it a poultice with butter, until the skin's burning heat is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a diaphenic ointment, or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you to take care during the operation, so that you keep the last dressing, lest something from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	Since if the eyelid becomes soft after a few days, and something fights from the hair in the eye, then apply medicine to that place which becomes soft from the eyelid itself, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore your consideration should be according to that: and do not hide the way of rectitude from him who has a zeal for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the method of cauterizing in a tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, with what we said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not succeed: then it is necessary to cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and let your assistant hold their head with their hands in such a way that it is not moved or agitated with their own head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put a poultice infused with egg white or a mucilage of fleabane on their eye: then apply the cauterizing iron, whose form is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Here is the translation:
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concavity is better suited for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract the sanies from it, and cleanse it. And if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then put a cauterium on it, which should be ignited strongly.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand there for a short time near the cauterium, away from the eye, so that your hand does not stray or disturb the weakened person: and you should place the cauterium on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you thus penetrate to the beginning of your cauterization up to the bone, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization once or twice, if it is necessary for that: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then put a dressing on with butter, and treat it with a cleansing ointment, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If it should surpass forty days and does not heal: then put a sharp corrosive medicine on it, until the bone is exposed: and scrape it according to what is written in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some first authorities have spoken about.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct yourself to the place of the fistula, and find it: then put a subtle cannula into the fissure, that is, a subtle canal, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of drachma from liquefied lead, and hold your hand with good cannula retention, and do not move the weakened person at all, so that it does not flow or penetrate to the eye with the liquefied lead.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary to put on the eye of the weakened person a dressing infused with egg white, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For the lead indeed burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	That which heals a fistula, together with what we have said concerning cauterization and treatment, is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nasal passage and to reduce the fistula to its own proper course, according to what will come into its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	On the method of cauterizing in labial fissures.

Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Many times there occur in the labial fissures, which are called Pili, and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you treat these fissures, with what we have said in the division of diseases, and treatment does not help, then apply a small cautery iron, according to this method.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let it be concave according to the subtlety of the cautery iron.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place the ignited iron quickly in those fissures, until it reaches the deep part of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a poultice, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	On the method of cauterizing in oral fistulas.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and bursts forth; afterwards it becomes chronic and flows with pus, and a fistula forms: then you treat it, and if treatment does not help in this case, then it is necessary to apply a cautery iron according to its size, which will encompass the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the ignited iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand there until the ignited iron reaches the deep part of it and its end; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterwards, with what we have said about treatment, until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the unhealthy part is cut off and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what appears on its surface.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	On the method of cauterizing in Gums and softening teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gums are softened due to moisture and the teeth move, and you have treated it with medicines and it does not improve, then put the head of the invalid on your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then prepare a cautery of fire, whose form will be described later, so that you place a small tube over the tooth; and insert the ignited cautery quickly; and hold your hand there for a short time, until the patient feels the heat of the fire having penetrated to the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to what is needed.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then the patient should fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for one hour; and then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the loose tooth is stabilized, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	On the method of cauterizing for pain in the teeth.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to coldness, or there is coldness in it, or worms, and treatment with medicines does not help, then cauterization on it is according to two methods: either cauterization with butter, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cauterization with butter is done thus: you take clarified butter, and boil it in a copper or iron spoon.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take the cloth, and wrap it around the extremity of the tooth.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then submerge it in the boiled butter; and place it quickly on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools down; then repeat it several times, until the strength of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, submerge the lance, or a piece of butter in cold water, and place it on the aching tooth; and place fiery iron on top of it, until the fire penetrates to the depth of the tooth's concavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	However, cauterization with fire is, so that you may direct it through a copper tube, or an iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of thickness in his body, so that the keenness of the fire does not penetrate to the weak mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then make a fiery cauterization, whose form will be thus; and place it on the tooth; and hold your hand, until the cauterization is cooled.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do that several times, for pain is relieved, either on the same day, or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary to apply pressure with that cauterization, so that the weak mouth is filled with good butter, and hold it for one hour; then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the Cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whatever extremity you wish, according to what is possible; and this is the form of the Tube.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Scabs.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When Scabs are from phlegm, and from cold humidities, and do not obey digestion through medicines, and you wish to hasten their digestion: then make a fiery cauterization, whose form is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Have two open extremities, so that smoke may exit from the cauterization through the other extremity: and place it ignited on the aposteme once, and a second time, if it is necessary, until it penetrates to the depth of the aposteme.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the aposteme is small: then place the cauterization according to the size of the aposteme.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place on it a piece of cloth soaked in butter, until what the fire has burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with a toothpaste, until the form of a cannula is healthy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	You should cauterize in a circular motion on the ulcer, and constrict the anus.
Caput XXV.	Head 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When humidity settles above the pulmonary canal, and especially when it is with a cold complexion, then it is necessary that the weak person be evacuated first with dissolved medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it in the nocturnal region at the root of the throat in a depressed place: and take care, lest you penetrate too deeply with the cautery to the throat, nor in the skin, unless some part of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck in its last vertebra, and let the cautery be a small nail according to the method that has gone before.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what has gone before, until it is healthy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	You should cauterize in a way of relieving the difficulties of the Lungs, and Cough.
Caput XXVI.	Head 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When Cough and difficulty of the Lungs are from cold humidities, and the weak person does not have fever, nor phthisis, and the difficulty is old: then cauterize it with two cauteries above the furcula in depressed, gentle, and empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be a cannula according to the form that has gone before.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish to cauterize with a point, puncturing with the cautery, which is called a Point, whose form has gone before in the punctuation of ear pain: and let the points be from thirty points almost to others.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what has gone before, until it is healthy.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Because it is alleviated with that cautery, when you make one of three Cauteries with it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	About the method of cauterizing in the shoulder joint, in the dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the arm bone is dislocated due to humid causes and does not return to its place in the hour of its reduction from the dislocation, unless it becomes accustomed to its return, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, therefore it is necessary to reduce the dislocation at first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the weak (patient) should be placed on his back or on his healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then elevate the skin which is on the inside of the shoulder joint upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then hold a cautery iron having two points.
Cuius forma est haec.	Its form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and there will be a figure of cauterization with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And when the cauterization is done with a cautery having three points, there will be a figure of cauterization then of six cauteries: and they are points according to the subtlety of the tension.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of the cautery having three points.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And when one is added in this way, there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place porous pomegranate seeds burnt with salt on the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then have the patient adhere to stillness, so that the limb is not moved for some time, until it becomes comfortable.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upwards, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it on the humerus with a cautery of multiple points, or with many punctures.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	About the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When there is cold and much humidity in the stomach, so that they extract it from its composition, and multiply the fluxes to it, and frequent methods of treatment do not help: then it is necessary for the patient to lie on his back, and stretch out his legs, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the nipple of the chest in the amount of one finger, and two cauteries below from the two sides of one cautery, until a triangular shape of the cauteries is formed.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And stretch out between both, so that they do not touch each other, when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be a quantity of two thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery that makes this cautery be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it with points that are terrified by this cautery: and it is, as you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you wish with encaustro: then cauterize it with the cautery of the point: then cure it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When there is pain in the liver from cold and humidity, or from thick flatulence, so that it departs from its natural composition and excessive superfluity, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and does not benefit from it: then it is necessary for the patient to lie on his couch, and be marked with encaustro three cauteries according to this figure, and in the same quantity below the liver from the hypochondries, where the elbow of a man reaches: and let there be space between each cautery according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the straight body: and do not press your hand too much with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the amount of it that is affected by the thickness of the skin be moderate, not added to its middle; and let it stand weakly on its feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If it is not standing, then let it be lying down, which has already stretched out its legs and lifted up its arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of a cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is certainly possible for you to cauterize with this cautery and a knife cautery, when there is subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And beware, lest you proceed too far in the cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is affected, because the entire body is affected, and it reaches the internal organs: for the skin there is subtle, so know that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of cauterizing apostemes of the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When there is an ulceration, and you wish to know if the aposteme is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, it induces a dull pain and heaviness without sharpness: and if it is in the membrane of the liver, it is accompanied by sharp and intense pain: and you see already that it has wearied out the physicians with its treatment.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary therefore that the weak person rests on his pillow.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then apply a figure to the place of the aposteme with an enamel: then ignite a cautery that is similar to a radius.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with that one cautery until the entire skin is burned, and it reaches the siphac, until all the sanies are evacuated: then take care to cure the ulcerations, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not fitting that this type of cautery be used, unless one's study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hand these diseases converge with experience many times: then indeed he dares to undertake an operation of this kind.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	And I do not want to abandon it, for in my opinion it is better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in the Lungs.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients have said that a cautery with the roots of Aristolochia is to be applied to a cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you should take from the dry roots of Aristolochia a root, one longer, which is found in them, and it should be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then submerge it in oil, and set it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery at the point which is between the junction of the shoulder-blade and the neck, and with two small cauteries under the guiding ridges on the lower part, which is beneath the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also at the point which is between the fifth and sixth ribs sloping backward, and with one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries on the back: one at the point which is between the two shoulder-blades, and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, the lower cautery being between the two shoulder-blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to press your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be on the open skin, emitting a fragrance.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And already some of the ancients have said that there are those who use a cautery made from iron like a file: and they set it on fire, and insert it between the ribs, until they reach with it to the aposteme itself, and the sanies flow out: as we described in the case of Epatis' aposteme.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cautery, there is fear that either the weak patient will die immediately, or a fistula will occur in that place, which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the method of cauterizing the Spleen Chapter 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat an illness of the spleen, with what we have said about the treatment of illnesses in the division on illnesses, and your treatment does not succeed, then cauterization is secondary according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of them is that you make three or four linear cauterizations along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, whose figure precedes.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every cauterization an amount of thickness equal to a finger's width, or a little more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cauterization be the one we mentioned in the cauterization of the liver, equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cauterization; and let the patient lie down on his back, relaxed.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: to have a cautery iron with two olive-shaped ends, which we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and elevate the skin that is directly over the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches; and let your elevation be such that you elevate the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce the two olive-shaped heated ends, until they penetrate the skin on the other side; then withdraw the cautery iron: thus four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you want to cauterize with a cautery iron having three olive-shaped ends.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care to apply the cautery iron after you have released it, to allow pus to flow out for many days; for it is more beneficial than all the other things that have preceded in the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in cases of dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	A cautery iron does not fall on a case of dropsy, unless the asclites are properly prepared.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a case of dropsy with the methods of treatment that we mentioned in the division, and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another above the liver, and one above the spleen, and two behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then apply a open cautery, so that it may emit pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not evacuate the weak patient from the treatment after the cautery with it, because it is necessary that two intentions are added to him; and he will be restored to health with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be circular: according to the form it precedes; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped according to the form it precedes.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are affected with hydrops and filled with citrine water: it is necessary to cauterize on the upper part of the foot at night, which is between the ankle-bone and the ring-finger; and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then lift your hand, and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the citrine water flows back, and the cautery should be according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be with the extremity of the knife-like cautery; and let the cautery be according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another lower than it, around the middle of the leg; and above each hip two cauteries; and apply an open cautery without treatment for a long time: so that some water may flow out from it; then treat it with the remaining things which we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in cases of abdominal abscesses.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is an abscess of the belly due to cold and humidity, until it debilitates the retentive and digestive virtues, which are in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with modes of treatment, but not healed; and you see a weak patient tolerant of a cautery of overflowing virtue, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his belly, according to what precedes in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle clave-like cautery; and a cautery above the abdomen above the groin, or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moistness and the patient tolerates it badly, then cauterize it with a cautery on the pubic region, and cauterize every limb; and perhaps apply two small cauteries to the stomach near the navel.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	It is indeed a profitable treatment, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from gross, cold, or corrupted humidities, and are treated with what we said in the division, but the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower vertebra of the back under the anklebone for a short time triangularly, and cauterize under the navel almost two fingers' breadth.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face to be affected, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has been said before: and cauterize on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a cautery of the vein: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing ulcers after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise an ulcer, then apply a cautery that is similar to a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the ignited cautery into the excised ulcer: and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein, from which the blood flows: do it once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many ulcers, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what is beneficial to them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on the shoulder blade, it is more useful in the healing process.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the treatment and operation that we have described in its proper place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he may be healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula occurs to someone, and it becomes chronic, pus flows out of it, and the corrupted moisture is drained.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is more worthy therefore that which ought to be done, so that you may probe it with a subtle probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the quantity of its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply a cautery, which is similar to a red-hot iron.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce the ignited cautery itself into the fistula and the quantity where the nail went in.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat over it the cautery, until all the corrupted bodies are burned away, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity of your necessary treatment.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And beware of adhesion to the nerve, if it is there, or large veins; or if the fistula reaches to the bladder body, or to the intestinal body, then beware of all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do that, unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and think that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed off, and the materials are cut off from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then know that it is now fully healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the materials do not cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupted opening deep within it, or something similar to those things: whose reminder will come in its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing Kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or gross flatulence, and it is diminished because of that weakened condition, then it is necessary to apply cautery on the loins over the kidneys, with a cautery iron over each kidney, whose previous mention should be recalled.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we should cauterize him again a second time in that same loin.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Because three lines are drawn.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more effective in the treatment.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness occurs in the bladder due to cold and humidity, so that the weak person does not retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the back above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic area begin, and with a cautery iron on the right side of the back, and another on the left side: and let the length of that cautery mark be according to the size of the knuckle of the thumb; and cauterize it with a lower dorsal cautery iron, or with two cautery irons if it is necessary: and let it be according to what was previously mentioned about the clavicular cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and humidity occur in the womb, and it is prevented from conceiving through that, and its menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs to her at the time of their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery iron on the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the clavicular cautery be applied.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing a dislocated limb.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When moisture is poured out onto the mucous membrane of the limb, and they are the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other when compared to each other; and the location of the dislocation is found empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	It is necessary therefore that you cauterize the weak area above the anchae with a similar circle of cautery to its own anchor; after you have marked it out with encaustic in the circumference of the anchae, as it revolves: and so that the very anchae falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of a shape that precedes in the cauteration of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	What if this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Concerning the method of cautering for sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the anchae and its causes are cold and humidity: and the weak area is treated with what we mentioned earlier, but the treatment does not help and it worsens: then it is necessary to free the weak area from gross humors with foul-smelling pills or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cautery in this is according to two modes: either cautery with medicines that adhere, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is to cauterize above the anchae itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between all the cauteries be of the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, the cautery is made in the middle above the head of the anchae itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Because there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose shape precedes in the cauteration of the dislocation of the anchae, one: so that it is a circle containing the entire anchae.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the hip itself and does not extend as far as the thigh.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends as far as the hip and thigh, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, above the place where the pain has settled, in which there is pain, and apply your cautery four finger-widths towards the Sylvan part for a short time: and let the cautery be gentle.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	What if the pain settles where it extends almost to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where it settles with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if the pain settles beneath the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize it there with a single gentle cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauteries that you do not ultimately burn with the cautery to the point of destroying a nerve or a large artery, and attract through it above the afflicted bad and harmful contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I have already seen one or another among those who have cauterized above the thigh and ultimately destroyed it in the cautery, and the thigh became inflamed, until a tumor followed to the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted: then there occurred a loosening of the intestine, and death afterwards.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	What if the pain is in both parts at the same time, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men have said that in the cautery of the hip, whose mode is this cautery.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar iron instrument whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its orifice according to the thickness of the core of the finger, or a little less: and within that instrument let there be a third instrument.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be a space that is between the entire forearm by the quantity of the node of the thumb; and let the bones be open from two parts; and let their height be like a node, or two nodes; and make for them a handle from iron, fitted to the bones with precision.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is heated in the fire until it becomes red-hot and shoots out sparks; then it should be placed on a pillow or cushion, resting on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Cauterize him therefore with three rounded cauteries at once in one vein.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it alone for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply a plaster with butter; and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis said, "We have used this type of cautery, the son of, only a little, because of the terror of its appearance; and therefore, we found few who would dare to rely on it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is one of the good cauteries for those who endure it, and finds a place with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cautery, however, is with medicinally attracting properties, so that you make two bones having a perforated armlet, in which descends the hinge of its gate from copper or iron, with a length equal to the wall: whose height should be two nodes, or as if they were themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be a space that is between the quantities of the thickness of the finger, and let them be open above and below; and let it be what contains itself together, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on a pillow or cushion, resting on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly on the pillow or cushion.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of hot water, which has been warmed with fire for a short time, and hold it for the quantity of an hour's duration: and let the patient tolerate its biting sensation and his own burning, for he finds the biting sensation as if from fire, until the biting subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then cleanse your hand with a instrument and wash off the warm water from the entire arm along with sweet water; then wait for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on it, until the blackness of the burn is removed; and wait for a few days, and clean out the pus from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the last stage in the healing process.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make him a bath of water in which he can sit, just as you did for the arm, equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of warm water; and I have already written about it in the treatise on medical rectifications.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkaline and non-extinguished lime, one part of each; grind both, and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which has a small hole perforated according to the quantity that will receive the radius; and place another pot underneath, empty and clean: and pour over the alkaline and lime sweet water, which submerges both by a finger's width: after which you compress it with your hand, using good pressure: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the clean pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water, and pour it over another lime; and strain, until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And they are among the medicines, with which arms are cauterized, also like thesis, and honey of ana cardium, and chalk with soap, so that both may be thoroughly mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed related that a certain man from ancient times was cured of his sciatica pain and arm pain; and he magnified its effectiveness as very strong.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that there is no need for another treatment, and that he was healed from one ulcer, since he had returned, because perhaps he himself had even delayed taking a bath, and he got out of it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, that a green plaster should be applied from galena: and if there is no green, let it be dried, fresh; and let it be ground into many small particles with some fat, and placed on the affected area, where there is pain, or in the leg, or in the hip: and let it be tied, and left for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels relief from the burning of the inflammation.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him to a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes porous, introduce him to the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not fitting to use any cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who said that the dung of goats, when with it a sciatic vein is cauterized, helps him; and a cautery is made according to this method.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let a piece of wool be dried, and soaked in old oil, and placed on the deep spot, which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle, and is closer to the ankle.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and set it on fire, until it becomes a charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool, and leave it, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease to do that, until the sensation reaches from the middle of the ankle, and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called Cautery of Goat's Dung.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	On the cauterization of pain in the back.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 43.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or a blow, or an excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and humid matter: and indeed cautery does not fail, unless in this one species alone, which is made from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after evacuating the patient with foul suppurations and similar things, so that three lines are made along the width of the affected area, where the pain is, on the back, afterwards marking with a cautery on each line five burn points, or more according to the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the patient's virtue; and let the cauterization be done with cauterized points.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three cauterizations or four, with a medial cautery of the spine, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of cauterizing on the curvature of gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This affliction often happens to small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its curvature in children is that it happens to them with a constriction in the breathing at the time of elevation, and movement; and you find it in the last vertebra of the back and its nodes, which are already beginning to curve over the remaining vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you see that and want to do it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is a circle according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery take hold equally over every part of the vertebrae; and if you want to cauterize around the vertebrae with a point-cautery two lines, or three; and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you administer the cautery on the gibbosity, which becomes a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing for Gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the joint pains are from cold humidities that flow to whatever member of the body, then when the pains occur in the feet, it is customary for doctors to call that Gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Since therefore a cold gout is treated with modes of treatment and pains do not recede, then burning away removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, that he should be burned with many burns around the joints of the foot after evacuation, and let the burning be with olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you notice points on the surface of the foot, then make them with a burning point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	What if pains ascend to the knees or remaining joints, and it often happens that, then burn them above every knee with three burns, or four from every part, with the same burning iron of Clauili.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If however more are needed for you with this burning iron, then burn it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the burning iron, but rather let it be around the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we said about burning iron in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	What if pains are only in the hands, then make points around the joints of the fingers, as two lines revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If however there remains pain in the fingers, then make points on them, above every node a point, and above the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then burn both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the weak from good regimen, from reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is made, and the phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God through this burning iron.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the method of burning in Hernias.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a hernia occurs in the groin, and the intestine descends, or a cyst to the testicle, and it is beginning to approach nearby: then it is necessary to advise the weak to dismiss congestion on its own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let it be touched gently, so that pus may descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then sit between your hands on his back: and order him to hold his breath, until it goes out, or a bubbling noise appears, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark it with a hot iron under the rupture over the bone of the chest, with a mark whose extremity is similar to the middle of a circle at the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply a cautery, whose shape is this, until it produces white (matter), and throws out small particles.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or the bubbling noise to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then the assistant should place his hand on the spot, so that the intestine does not protrude: and you have now opened between the thighs of the patient, and placed a cushion under him, and one servant is above his thighs, and another above his chest who holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then apply the cautery to that spot, with your hand standing upright straight with the cautery.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it, until you join the bone: or try with it another time, if you have not succeeded with it at first until reaching the bone.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And wisely observe from the exit of the intestine at the time of your cautery, lest you burn it, and it happens to the patient through that, or death, or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not succeed with the cautery in reaching the bone, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery be subtle and fine, according to their measurement.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the remaining ointments, until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to put his nourishment in proportion to the length of time of his cure, which soothes his belly: so that the intestine does not protrude during effort and straining.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when you wish to operate after forty days, then administer a ligature made in the center, and hold it for forty more days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should be relieved from labor, and replenished with food and drink, and avoided from vehement voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, then he will be healed with a complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will describe the treatment of hernias with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When however hernias occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and it seems as if they do not increase, then cauterize that hernia with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let that which is touched from then on be like a third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat him, as we have said: and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And already some of the first ones have said: that the hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with an encaustic, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the hernia, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a cautery in the shape of a nail.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain members from a fall or blow, and the pain persists for a long time, and is not helped by medical treatment: then it is necessary to cauterize with a puncturing cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be of each member a cautery according to its magnitude, and its own smallness, and weakness, and its own virtue, and the location of the twisting, and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore he is healed by the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then apply a cautery to it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Since it is customary to transfer these pains from the member to that which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore, it is necessary to treat them with a cautery until the injured part is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But leprosy patients are sometimes helped by a cautery with the greatest benefit.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy; therefore, one should carefully consider the use of cauterization for it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If the leprosy is incurable and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division, and it does not recede, nor does it stand still; and meanwhile the disease comprehends a corruption over the entire complexion of the patient: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one on the crown of the head, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on both horns, and one behind on the nucha of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally, apply your hand with the cautery for a short time, until it makes a small impression on the mouth, and the cortices are dislocated from it: so that the exhalation of gross vapors is alleviated from it, and cauterize also with the cautery over the spleen, according to what has been mentioned beforehand.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears manifestly, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries, which we mentioned on the head, and with a cautery on the extremity of the nose, and with two cauteries on both jaws, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the lumbar region near the end of the spine, and one above it, in that same place: and with two on the thighs; namely, one on each thigh, and with two on the knees, one on each knee, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the wrists, and with two on the tenderness of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers and toes, and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and on the palms of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And be careful not to cut the nerves that are above the heel bone, so as not to injure them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when you cauterize with a caustic on the bone of the pubes, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add caustic, it is a greater harm, and less beneficial.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the weak person does not find pain in the caustic, as the healthy ones do: therefore, because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the caustics be of a size, and smallness, according to the members and joints: according to what precedes from the types of iron instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the caustic with a powder made from the herb with honey, and other treatments, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the method of cauterizing on the stupefaction.
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a member is numb and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize the numb member with caustics, according to what the size of the member deserves, or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your caustic penetrate to a moderate depth into the skin's thickness.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when cauterization is done for a certain numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that member: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	However, it does not succeed except for one who is knowledgeable in the anatomy of members and the exit of moving nerves of the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterizing on Ulcers.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When an ulcer is ancient and does not benefit from any ingenuity of medicine: then cauterize over it with a deep caustic, according to the quantity of skin thickness, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the meal of the herb, and gentle with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and blood of pigeon, and blood of hyrundine: let each be a single part: mix all these together, and apply them to a cloth, and adhere to the place until it heals.

Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is beginning and you want to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The wise men have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But it does not seem so to me, for I fear that it would ulcerate; and I have already seen that many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said; or with multiple cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterizing in Anchylosis.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Anchylosis and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excessive superfluous matter causing it, or because of the weakness of old age, when there is a scarcity of blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten its maturation, then cauterize around its circumference with many small points of multiple cauteries.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten its maturation itself.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If you want to make a perforation in it with a cautery, then ignite the cautery, whose shape is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Anchylosis, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows, so that the flow of pure humors may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the method of cauterizing in corroding ulcer.
Caput LIIII.	Head 54.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Gangrene is not except a corruption in a walking limb, and it consumes the same: just as fire devours dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see gangrene in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then apply multiple small and large cauteries with fire, according to what is convenient for the place where the gangrene is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and none of it remains deeply.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized place sulfur rubbed with oil, until all scabs are eradicated, and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And gangrene is treated occasionally with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	That very thing [gangrene] surges up at the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is a very swift remedy; and I have already said that cautery of it [gangrene] with sharp medicine is in the division; therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cautery for wounds and abscesses.
Caput LV.	Head 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	It often happens that this disease occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filthy discharge that hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed, cautery for them is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for the cautery with fire, it is like a hollow cauterizing iron similar to a bird's feather, which is made from iron, according to the quantity that holds the nail on every side; and let its edge be subtle.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then put it ignited upon the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then revolve the hand with a cautery in a circle around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it there for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply a poultice made with bad willow twigs, mixed with salt: and leave the poultice on it overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It itself will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with a salve that generates flesh, until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	What if they are not converted, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer to them a cautery with hot water: and it is, that you should receive a tube made from copper, or iron, or from a vulture's quill: and put it upon the nail, or the joint.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour into the tube a small amount of hot water: hold your hand, and you revolve it with pressure from your hand for a short time, so that the mark of the tube is impressed on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and wait for a short while above the biting of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it, for the nail is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do thus with each one after another, until you come to all those that are on the body because of them.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them afterwards when they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in cases of trembling.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When trembling occurs to someone from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or from something else: then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries, or five on the vertebrae of his back, and between each vertebra a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and above his stomach a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremors are quieted with a warm cautery, and a healthy recovery is hastened from a cold disease.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterizing by Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When foul things are expelled from the body by Albathir's method, that is, pustules, which are caused by rotten and corrupted materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is necessary, therefore, first of all, when they appear, to cauterize on the whole head with a subtle cautery made of myrtle wood, whose extremity has been set on fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized to the point of their own expulsion, at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase: and the excess is dispersed, making them healthy, and they are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that it be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a vein.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery, which has been cut near the vein, which occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or a cautery of a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When it happens to someone in this way, then hasten with your hand to the orifice of the artery, and place your index finger on it: and press it firmly, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing comes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place small olivary cauteries on the fire, and many more in great number: and blow on them until they are well-ignited.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, or a small one, or a large one, according to the vein and place where the artery is disrupted, and apply the cautery to that vein, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	What if it is expelled with elevated fingers from the orifice of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery, one that has been prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore, do not stop doing it with one after the other, until the blood is staunched.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and another malicious disease is added to the injured place.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to staunch it, especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, the extremities of the artery contract, and the blood is staunched.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it may be tied with a strong ligature thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medications of special property are applied to it, which staunch the blood, and are bound with a decent poultice constricting tightly.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever administers the staunching of it with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or application of burning things, and similar things, does not benefit him thoroughly, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to someone in that way, and there is no present doctor, nor medicine: then let him begin with the application of his index finger on the orifice of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and constriction of it strongly, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not removed, but rather it remains on it with very cold water of extreme cold, until the blood congeals, and thickens, and is staunched.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, let him consider in that, what he needs from a cautery, or from medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	¶ End of the First Part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Perforation, and Bloodletting for Wounds, and Similar Things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	I will discuss in the First Chapter all the kinds of illnesses for which it is suitable to use fire cautery and burning medicine, and their applications, their causes, and their instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed chapters from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter by the same method, so that it may be alleviated from the questioning inquiry about it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, my sons, what is in this chapter, because it arises from the fear of that which is in the first chapter about cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, it is necessary to be more cautious, since in the operation which is in this chapter, often there is a collapse with bleeding, when life stands at the opening of a vein, or an incision over an abscess, or an opening of an exit, or a curing of a wound, or an extraction of an arrow, or an incision over a stone, and similar things; from all of which tremble, fear, and death occur in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest it falls upon you that which is hesitation, for when they fall to you in this art of men with modes of infirmity.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there is one who becomes angry with his own illness, and death is light for him: because of the violence of that which he finds from his infirmity and the length of his evil.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness there is fear because it signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And there is one who gives his own treatment, and says to you with it, hoping for health, but his illness is pernicious.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it is not necessary to consent to him who comes to you from those whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let our caution be greater than our desire and our own grasping avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And let us not presume upon anything from that, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for us that thing to which a praiseworthy success has arrived.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And let us use prognosis and indication in the treatment of all our patients, for that which is most conducive to their health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For it is a helper to you for the acquisition of fame and glory, and of memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with His intellect, and may He not withhold from you direction and inspiration; for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed arranged this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter of Cauterii, from the head to the feet: so that you may be relieved of what you wish to ask about, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the treatment of water that accumulates on the heads of children.
Caput I.	Head 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this illness often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightly grasps the child's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And it also happens sometimes due to a hidden cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have indeed not seen this disease in others than in children: and to all whom I saw it was a hastening of death: therefore, for that reason, it seemed best to me to abandon the operation on them.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have indeed seen one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was greatly enlarged every day, until he could not sit up by himself, due to the greatness of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed either accumulates between the skin and bone: or it accumulates beneath the bone on the surface.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in this case, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head in a transverse direction: and let the length of the incision be about two knots, until the moisture flows out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a scalpel.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is greatly increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head opened from every side; and the water is pressed out when you compress it with your hand towards the interior, and it does not hide from you: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then close the incisions with bandages and poultices.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then apply a compress of wine and oil above it until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then remove the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not forget to bind the head with equal pressure.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And give the patient food that is dry and of little humidity, until the member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the greatness of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Since sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, ascend with the incision where you see the abscess and collection of water: and divide it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And take care not to cut an artery, and a flow of blood may occur, and the patient may die from that flow with evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When there occurs a flow of humor to the eyes or to the chest, and it becomes chronic, and medical treatments do not help, then the last resort is surgery, namely the cutting of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore, when you want to make an incision, that the weak head should be shaved.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries may appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the weak-necked one tighten his neck with any cloth of his own.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulses.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places on both sides are those that are depressed behind the ears; and they are rarely hidden, unless in certain men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a hot iron on both sides; and make an incision on both sides with a three-edged scalpel, making the incision reach to the bone: and let it be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it from above with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating discharge, which leaps inward with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If, however, the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers' width.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with a hot iron, and make an incision up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what is necessary to emit from the blood is six ounces, or perhaps more or less will be emitted from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of that according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the weak man and the fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the ulcer.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if something remains on the bone from the suppuration, then cut that out, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the ulcer with a linen bandage.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Head 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old hemicrania affects a person, or acute catarrh due to acidic and salty humidities, and heat in the temples, or old soda, it is vehement and similar to those; and it is treated with the methods of medical curation, but it does not help: then we have resorted to extracting arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operating in extracting them is to shave off the weak hairs that are in the temples, and to direct it towards the apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It is itself shown to you from its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few people, or due to the weakness of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then let him bind his weak head with any cloth of his; afterwards, rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or warm the place with hot water, until it appears to you in a clear manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the scalpel, which I formed a little while before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape off the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it, and draw it out upwards, until you have drawn it out of the skin, and make it emerge from the tunics that are beneath it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is subtle: then enfold it with the extremity of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it a part according to the quantity by which its extremities are lengthened and contracted, so that there is no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not separated, the blood does not ascend deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate the blood from six to three ounces.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large, then it is necessary to ligate it in two places with double thread, strongly, from silk or from Alhohod's cord, so that putrefaction does not occur before the consolidation of the wound and the flux of blood occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then incise the superfluity which is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do it at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery iron up to the bone, with a cautery iron shaped like a knife: until the extremities of it are incised and it is stable in its place in the same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better work, unless the patient has a fever, or is of a hot and dry temperament.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Since cautery iron is one of those things that help to dispel humidity.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries to fill the place with old cotton: and that soft poultices made with art should be applied over it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the surgical treatment is finished with dry medicines that promote the growth of flesh, and with bandages, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If during the operation a flux of blood occurs from the artery, then hasten to stop it with a cautery iron, or to fill the place with zegi: and bind your hand tightly, until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of these is available to you at present, then put your finger on the place, until the blood congeals.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And bathe the place with water of vehement coldness, until the acuteness subsides, and bind it according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from what is lighter and easier for the extraction of the artery, it is to cauterize the vein with this cautery iron having two blades: and let the acuteness be similar to that of two blades, like Almagdat's.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much smaller and less sharp than two scalpels.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like the two scalpels, they would cause both cold and injury to the flesh with swiftness.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Since therefore there is a certain amount of thickness in them, heat from the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is separated quickly; thus this method is better than any other operation, and easier, and more convenient.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be a space that is the thickness of a finger between the two scalpels, after you have marked two places with ink; and apply both ignited (scalpels) strongly, until they reach the bone, and make an incision in the two places: so that what is between the extremities may be elongated.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not consolidate deeply with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of acute and chronic tears flowing from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are chronic tears and the flow of them is from the veins which are on the outer surface of the skull; and no medical treatment with medicines is effective for them, and you see the face of the patient already red, and they feel a sensation of walking in their forehead, as if it were an army of ants: and their eyes are sunken, moist, so that the eyelashes have already been corroded by the corrosion; and their eyelids are hot from the acuteness of the tears: then the ancient (doctors) needed help for the treatment of these with this operation, and they called it "Ense" treatment.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is that you should warn the patient to shave the hairs that are on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equal distant incisions on the forehead along its length: and let the length of each incision be about two fingers, and one incision be equidistant from the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little above the movement of the eyebrows, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand at the continuation of the two jawbones, and let there be a space of three fingers' width for the entire incision: and have ready a piece of dry sponge or many layers of dry cloth, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a spatula of two acute extremities, whose following shape is sequential.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is on the temporal part, up to the second incision: and excavate with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, together with the sifa, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, having one side blunt, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its blunt side towards the bone: and push it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut away with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except what is contained in the incision up to what appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do the same in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a equal amount of blood has flowed out, press on the place with pieces of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put a linen cloth into every fissure, soaked in old wine, and put over them small cotton pads soaked in wine or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that there does not occur a hot aposteme.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the ligature, and administer a plentiful infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with royal ointment, and the remaining remedies by which wounds are treated: until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs in the eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	Head 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute catarrhs occur, bitter, persistent: and you see the eyes of that person exhausted, small, and already their sight is weakened: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and in the depths of the head there is sharp pain, annoying, and a consequent sneezing: then take from these accidents, that those materials and catarrhs do not come, unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, as you should carefully shave the patient's forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to one side along the width, and start from a point on the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be up to the bone: and extend your hand from the temples that move during mastication: until the bone is exposed: and dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with a bandage of old cloth, or with a linen thread.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then sprinkle on top with powders: and moisten the powders with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not form.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve it, and you see that a hot abscess is already forming: then it is necessary to rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes flesh growth: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of rose oil, and prepare an ointment from them, and apply it to the birthplace of the flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Of the treatment of that which falls into the Golden (Ointment).
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the Golden (Ointment) is of one of four species: either a mineral stone, or similar to a stone, such as iron and copper; or it is from a plant, such as chickpea and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water, vinegar, and their likes; or it is something animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls into the Golden (Ointment), or a type of stone from those that do not combine with it, nor grow in the Golden, expose the Golden to the sun: if therefore you see a stone, then distill something into the Golden from violet oil or siuminum.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction, and make a sternutary with condiments, and apply soft linings at the approach of the sternutation, after you place a wrapping of cloth or wool around the ear, and extend the ear to the top.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For it often happens that he walks out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If however he does not walk out, then administer the extraction of it with gestures, that is, with subtle manipulations: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore he walks out with gestures, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a subtle hook of little curvature.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore he does not walk out through that, then make a cannula from copper, and introduce the extremity of the cannula into the ear hole as much as possible, and apply what is around the cannula with soft wool softened with oil, so that there may be no passage except through the cannula: then extract with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For it often happens that he walks out with what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If however he does not walk out in this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from uisco, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and put it at the extremity of the radius after you have wrapped around it a well-placed cot; then introduce it into the ear hole with ease, after you have removed the ear from humidity.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore he does not walk out with all that we have described, then hasten to dissect, before a hot abscess or spasms occur.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of incision is, to make a small cut in the head at first, and then extract from him blood according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear to the top, and find a small incision at the root of the ear near its fatty part in the depressed place itself: and let the incision be a lunar shape, until you reach the bone: then remove it with what is possible for you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then you should make an incision with your knife quickly and treat it, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	What if the thing that falls into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and become inflamed: then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey you at the outlet, then take a thin, subtle, and secondary spatula according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it an excision of that species from the grains that fall into the ear, and do not do that when you think that the grain has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you place many rough things: then extract them with hooks, or with subtle gestures, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of those alleviates.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water that flows into the ear, it is necessary to use a gentle irrigation with condensation at first: and now fill your own ear with some old cotton: and it lies above the ear in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If then it flows out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of the finger, thin, smooth, and warm them with fire for a short time, and gently insert one of them into the ear canal: and let it slip out beneath its foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Do not cease to do that with stone and stone until all the water flows out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water flows out thus, that you take from a small paper or from one reed, and insert one end into the ear: and heat the other end with fire, until it burns most of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another reed, and do that many times, until all the water flows out: and extract it with a tube according to what has been previously mentioned about the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal entering into it, if it is a small body, such as a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I have described in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body, which appears to the senses: then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks: and its removal is easier than all those that are held in a grasp.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division, and in the treatment of dislocations, and your cure does not succeed: then it is necessary to examine the ear in solitude.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears there from the worms, then extract it with gestures or with subtle hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however something does not appear there, then take a cannula, whose form is this, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the subtle extremity into the ear according to the quantity that the weakened part can tolerate: then suck with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do it many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If however they do not obey you to come out, then smear the area around the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	What if they do not come out with what I have said: then administer the distillations that have been tried by the ancients in the infection of worms: and you will find it in the treatment of dislocations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring be with which you pour oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver or copper, narrow below, wide above, with a small hole, and a large opening.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it be so that the thing which is propelled into the concavity of the cannula, let it be made from copper, properly fashioned.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take the rod, and wrap a cotton thread around its extremity with decent wrapping: then pour oil or juice, or what you wish from those medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the rod with the cotton thread above, and express it by hand with tempered compression, until the oil is propelled into the concavity of the hearing, and the weakened part feels it inside: and what is poured into the ear should already be warmed up with a small fire: and beware lest there be a thing that is distilled in it coldly: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	About the treatment of an accidental wound of the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants are born from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has already happened that some men have had a perforation in the middle of their ear from a wound or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this perforation sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which does not impair vision; and sometimes it occurs at the outer part of the ear canal, and then it impairs vision.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which is not perceived by sight, is in many cases difficult to cure.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which impairs vision, you should place the ear of the patient in a sunny spot and gaze into it; then if you see an apparent perforation, open it with a subtle spatula whose shape is this: its extremity should have a small width, one part of which should be acute; and the rest of the spatula should be smooth on both sides, so as not to harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the perforation is from flesh born in the middle of the ear, then hold it with a subtle hook, and cut into it with gentle violence, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the perforation is deep within the ear, then take a subtle rod, smooth and warm it over a small flame; then insert it into the middle of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel the perforation with it, which the patient has found with difficulty of hearing, try to open it gently; and beware, lest you wound the nerve of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put into the ear a small amount of linen according to the size of the ear canal, which you had wrapped in Egyptian unguent; do this for several days, until you are secure about the consolidation of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take linen, and soak it in rose water, and sprinkle powdered zeolite over it, and use it thus.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the abscess has become apostemated, then it is necessary to extract the pus, and allow it to flow out with another licinium, which you have made with rose oil, until the warm apostema settles; then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if a flow of blood happens, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the abscess; and use the remaining treatment which separates the flow of blood, as described in the treatise on distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelids with Althel.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the Althel that occur on the eyelids when they are moist and become dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to hold them with tweezers or with a hook, and to cut them off from their roots with a spatula.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then apply powdered zegi on the places.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lentil-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of pustules on the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens on the eyelids that something occurs which resembles a pustule in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called a Grandum; and it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation for them is, therefore, to consider then, if it is a Grandum that proceeds from the eyelid, which appears on the eyelid and moves to every part, and its treatment is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Make a longitudinal incision above it along the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from every part as easily as possible, until you reach.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then lift it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If the cutting off of it is not prepared for you, unless after you have penetrated the eyelid with a short incision, then it will hurt the patient in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the wound is large: then bring it together with a suture: and care for it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it, and flesh grows over it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the perforation is sloping inward toward the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and lift the perforation with a hook: besides what you need for the incision, and press it from every part.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	For if the eyelid is lengthened through the incision, it will not hurt in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the perforation with salty water: and care for the place with that which grows flesh, until the patient is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a thickening that forms on the upper eyelids: and it mostly happens to children: and it weighs down their eyes, and they have morning discharge, and they cannot gaze at the light of the sun, because tears flow to them, and because of this they are seen to lie with their faces always bent downwards, and they sleep with their eyelids beneath their humid eyebrows, which have already been infected by inflammation: and indeed Axirnath appears obvious to the eye, and when you press on the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath among them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on it is that the patient puts his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare on it the threads, and make from that thread a second circle according to the quantity contained by the instrument from every part.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it upon it, and press with your fingers on every part, so that the instrument is gathered together in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the midst of that humidity with a spatula incident on the fissures across the width, and let there not be a greater fissure than that which is made in deep phlebotomy.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary to make a complete incision, until you reach the instrument in many arrangements, for the instrument proceeds from the fissure according to the form of the white albuminous crust.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract it then with the cloth, which you had placed between your fingers to the exterior; and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and beware, lest you touch the fissure, so that you do not reach with the spatula to the eye, and harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however the instrument does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you should add a little to the fissure with ease, until the instrument proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with poultices.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are those who rub salt, and place it in the concavity of the fissure, so that it liquefies what remains from that humidity.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a warm aposteme occurs at the spot, then treat it with cooling plasters, until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the methods of Ataxmir for the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft and enervated, so that it becomes rough as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond their natural course under the natural lashes, and become entrenched: then they harm the eye, and bring about modes of illness, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and a white opacity, until it becomes a cause of destruction to the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir indeed cures the eye according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, according to what has been mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir cures by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by tubes, according to what I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you put the head of the patient on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn back the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is thus turned back, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce a needle into it, where the thread is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it back with a straight line.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner part of the eyelid, under the hairs that have grown, with a spatula inserted from the greater lacrimal to the lesser lacrimal.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread, and place under the eyelid a small poultice made of cotton or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with ink, which should be in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the figure be according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: because already it varies in humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are some who need to have a large quantity excised from the eyelid, according to the quantity that is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, when you find the spatula resting on two lines which you have marked, and begin at the larger lacrimal duct up to the smaller one, and let there be a single fissure near the natural hairs, just like the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce a hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then excise the entire thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together with a suture the two lips, with sharp needle and fine thread of wool: and cleanse the blood, and make adhere what is superfluous from the threads above the eyebrows, with certain things that are not visible, if you want to do it: and if not, do not worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads until three days, or four: afterwards take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and take care of it with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated at the sign of the wound and its aggregation: but the future is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancient ones taught this method of healing, attributed to Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern about the weak patient, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is also from Ataxmir: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a shape, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then elevate the eyelid with three separate or aggregated hooks, according to this shape that follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small forceps, according to this shape, with equality of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not equal that: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the shape: and insert one thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and another thread near the smaller one: and bring together the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then elevate your hand in elevation equal to it: and elevate the skin above which is marked with a scar, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and take care of it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If indeed an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: but treat that abscess with a poultice, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when it happens to the eyelids as well, so that their hairs may be turned away.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary therefore that you use what we have said about the incision: but the suture of both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you turn away the eyelid, and sew up the fissure which is within, according to what I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two canes, or two subtle wooden rods: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of the spatula: and you have already made an incision at the extremities of both, from which you hold threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then bring together each one with subtlety above what is overflowing from the eyelid of the eye, and tie two canes from both parts with a strong binding, and leave it for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin will be tightly constricted, and will blacken, and will putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it is thus delayed, then cut it away with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it is thus consolidated, the eyelid is elevated: and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two canes, which you make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On elevating pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Head 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation is to take a subtle needle and insert into it a thread of fine silk, thin.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you should join the extremities together, and make knots on both sides with a subtle knot, and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then you should insert another subtle thread underneath in a short space, and tie together the extremities if it is necessary.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the patient should place his head on your lap, and it should be near a window so that the operation can be illuminated: because this is a subtle operation, or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then you should insert the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelash, and make it penetrate the eyelid firmly, until you extract it above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw out the hair up to the thread; and insert into the thread that hair: if it is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the thread in the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If, however, the thread is drawn and the hair does not emerge with it: draw the thread downwards, with the filament that you composed in it, until the thread emerges from the superior opening, and you will see it with the vision of the eye: then indeed draw the thread, and the filament: and extract both, and close the eye: and keep it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from the natural hairs, and elevate it with that: or leave it, until it elongates after a space, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the treatment of Al-xatrati which occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Head 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this occurs in the eye, it is called a cataract.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this cataract is either innate or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	The accidental one occurs therefore from the consolidation of a wound, or a cut, or a burn, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operating on it is that you make a consolidation, and separate its lips, and place between them a lint made of linen, and bind it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not suitable to use in the treatment of it things that dry and constrict; for if you do that, the cataract will return worse than it was. Instead, use in its treatment things that soften, such as fenugreek; and boil it in water in which there is marshmallow root, flaxseed: and anoint with a liquid unguent, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap with a lint, and take care of it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all ingenuity, so that it does not consolidate, according to the form it had at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And indeed this operation which we have described is not anything but a certain rectification of the cataract, so that the form of the place does not return to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	About the treatment of a cataract that occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 13.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This cataract that occurs below is truly called a cataract.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is innate, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or a crack, or a burn, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and pierce the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upwards with a hook and make an incision with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the shape of the eyelid returns according to what is fitting, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a rod, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and find two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from two angles of the incision, until they converge and form an angle: until when they are gathered together, this figure is formed, and it is a praised Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh in quantity, which is the sharp side below, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts: sew them together with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, with softening medications and bandages, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a fracture occurs from the incision and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary to make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that it runs into this operation, according to what is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is indeed of many diverse forms: and the skilled artisan prepares their ingenuity with whatever method is possible for them, so that they may restore the figure to its natural form, or near to it, and themselves infirm, according to what is fitting for them from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the eye with the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the whiteness of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you should introduce the extremity of the radius under the eyelid and elevate it upwards: or extend it with a hook. Then make an incision with a subtle spatula, which is not acute, but rather obtuse for a short distance: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and the eye is irritated by its acuteness. And let your incision be such that you cut away the adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salty water into the eye, with water washing it away: or distill into it a solution made from zinc oxide dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a thread of flax: and place on the eye a fleece soaked in egg whites: and after three days use a collyrium, and with consolidating remedies, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominent flesh of the tear-producing glands.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You should know that the nail is removed in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Either it is nerveless: and it is similar to a hard, subtle callus.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nerveless, similar to a frozen white humidity: which when touched with iron, or hooked with a hook, becomes detached, and the hook does not stick into it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types do not begin unless from the larger tear-producing gland, until it flows gradually, until it covers the sight, and prevents movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on it is: that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and elevate the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then grasp the nail with a hook of little duplication, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle and insert it into the pilum made of horse or cow hair, or goat hair: and let the thread be strong, and double the extremity of theacus somewhat, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with anacus, and tie it with a thread to the nail, and extend it upwards: and scrape away the pilum from the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were to sew it with a pilum right up to its posterior.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a subtle spatula or small forceps: and let the natural flesh of the tear duct remain, so that the flow of tears is not hindered by the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with a hook alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape away with a gentle spatula, whose shape is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the spatula touches the corneal tunic and causes a rupture there, and the pupil is perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, apply to the eye some crushed salt or a concoction made from zinc, and let it remain there until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is fitting until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	But if the nail is not nervy, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor fix a hook in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicines, and healed as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	But if you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the injured one, and take a subtle, gentle, weak and precise spatula, according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the nail from above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	But if you see that it is rarefied and roughened, and an impression is made on it by the razor, then distill at that hour into the eye a concoction made from zinc, or from red copper, or from tritulated salt: and cover the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then you should repeat the same operation, until everything is removed from it.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a contrary abscess in your eye, which is warm and inflamed: then indeed leave it, and treat the abscess, until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with scraping, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The prominence of the eyelid flesh, if it harms the eye with great annoyance, should be suspended with a hook, and a part of it should be cut away: and not the last incision, so that the flow of tears does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then apply a styptic to the eyelid if it is red, or made from zinc, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the incision of Al-Guardenzie, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	There is born sometimes in certain eyes of men a red fleshy growth, either composite or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns them outward: and it resembles a rose-like excrescence.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation for it is also such that he puts his weak head on your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh together with suitable hooks convenient to it: and hold it with one forceps, or carry it.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh at first, until everything is finished with an incision.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so that you do not harm it during the operation: and let your incision be such as you make it with a spatumili, which we have described in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which the asperity is collected, according to what form it takes after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your incision is complete, and the entire Al-Guardenzie is removed, then fill the eye with a contrary poultice of salt: or distill into it a red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines: and place over the eye a defensive cotton pad with albumen water: so that it may be secured from warm abscess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If something remains from the surgery and warm blood dominates you, and a warm abscess is forming: then leave the eye alone, and treat it with what soothes the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with the treatment, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with the flesh that has grown in the eye from this type.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary to avoid alienating the weak curative power of the whole eye from its natural or accidental way, by operating with iron: and do not introduce your hand in any of these operations, until you see that the member is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On collecting pus from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Pus is a red vein that forms on the eye and prevents the power of vision from operating, and it weakens the eye over time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary for you, therefore, to consider first whether the eye in which there is pus is strong and does not have any illness except the pus: then collect its pus.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is, that you should advise the weak one to place their head on your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be subtle and double-layered, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graduated on one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with subtle forceps those veins subtly, and absorb the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins being removed from the eye, and they resolve: and beware not to harm the eye with excessively sharp instruments.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be firm in your operation indeed: so that you do not touch anything except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have completed it, then distill into the eye a green or red [substance]: so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the pus.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If you are not able to gather that whole thing at that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye; and leave it there for several days, until the pain is calmed; and let it be secured from an apostemic heat: then apply again in the same way, until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of a scalpel.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the Reduction of a Fracture of the Nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The doctor calls a fracture of the nose a fistula, which he treats with cauterization or with acute medication that burns, according to what has preceded in his narration.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no cleverness in that; unless you place a poultice on the aposteme at its birthplace, and extract all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see in it corruption or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called a rasp of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made from iron, and let its head be round like a file, which is marked with the marking of a lime or the subtle marking of a scalpel; and put it on the corrupted place of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn it around between your fingers, and press your hand for a while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do it several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with dry, stimulating medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of blood is stopped: and it remains for forty days, and does not get worse, and does not become apostemic, and no accident happens to it: then you know that it has already healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no cleverness in it, unless you reduce the fistula to the nostril, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you detach from the bone with a second iron, or with an acute medicine; and when the bone is detected, then take a second trephine of this form, whether it is an iron extremity, triangular: and its wood should be a pyramid extended to the extremity, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear-drop; and extend your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the trephine, until it penetrates the bone, and let it feel the weakness; for when it finds an exit from there, it will come out, when you hold your hand over your nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with astringent medicines that dry, as I have instructed you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh grows, and the place hardens: then the matter that flowed out to the exterior returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter on the weakness.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the Reduction of a Prominence in the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its entirety, and no harm occurs in the sight, nor diminution: then it is necessary to loosen the weakness; afterwards, phlebotomize it; next, apply cups to the nape of the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye an ointment that is made from acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye above with a plaster containing many powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of powders is: that you take many soft cloths, and each cloth should be doubled over four; make many from them; then place one on top of another, according to the quantity which the eye needs; then bind over them with a hard cloth, tightly fastened.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And apply cups again with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then apply poultices, and release the constricted eye by day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If, however, the ligament is softened again, then it is necessary to constrict it much: then apply a poultice to the ligament by day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If, therefore, you see the eye already recovered to its own membrane, it is good: and if not, then try again a plaster, and poultices, and constrictions, and applications, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the incision of the conjunctiva.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a disruption occurs in the conjunctiva, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of conjunctiva, and it is deformed into a human-like shape because of that, and it is necessary to cut into it: then the operation on it is, according to what I relate: and it is, as you introduce a needle in the root of the conjunctiva from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle where there is a double thread on the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate: and release the first needle according to its own arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie it with the conjunctiva around the circumference of the needle: and constrict it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the needle, and place a soaked linen cloth over the white of the eye: and leave it there, until the thread falls away with the conjunctiva.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with what comforts it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the conjunctiva is constricted from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it should be perforated with a subtle spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the humidity of the white part is drained, and the eye subsides, and it enters immediately: then constrict it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	About the treatment of a wound on the head.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called Alcomnati is not, unless it be a flux, that gathers in the eye, like descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is to make the patient sit on a prepared or directed seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head with your two hands from both sides, and move it until you feel the flux coming down to the lower part of the eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is pressed, and does not flow down, and the light is freed; and the patient sees things as he saw them before; and if it does not flow down below, you will know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the flux of the discharge does not come down with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a subtle sponge, and apply it above the cornual pannicle near the junction with the corneal tunic, until the discharge comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it comes out, then pour warm water into the eye, in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the remaining treatment, until he is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	About the treatment of water that flows into the eye, or a cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	Now we have discussed the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for piercing, declaring and explaining it with a sermon, then take the same according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary to make the patient sit between your hands, squarely facing the light, near a window; and bind his healthy eye, and tie it tightly; then touch the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if it is the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand the cotton, if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the cotton near the crown through the thickness of the radius in the white part of the eye appearing as a small lachrymal lake; then push the cotton with force; and you will revolve with it your hand, until it penetrates into the whiteness of the eye: and you will feel that the cotton has now reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the path of the cotton be to the depth, a measure of space which is from the pupil up to the end of the blackness; and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see them in the same pupil of the vision of the eye, due to the clarity of the transparent corneal tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the cotton up to the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards with one finger after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the weak one sees that which appears above his sight immediately, and the cotton is in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then put it down for a second, except that the cotton should come out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the cotton with ease: and you will revolve your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something in water from a clear gem-like salt: and wash the eye within with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside the whole eye a gauze, or a wool cloth soaked with rose oil, and of the whiteness of the eye: and bind it with a healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, however, and those who are of our time, put on top of it a layer of triturated cumin with the whiteness of the eye.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the cotton does not obey you at the entrance into the eye due to its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Here is the translation:
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the scalpel, secondly as we have described.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your operation, prepare a comfortable bed for the weak patient, made in a dark room, where they can sleep on their back: and prohibit them from all movements, and from coughing: and give them food that soothes their nature: and let them not move their head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the dressing remain in place according to its own arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then remove it in that dark room, and test its strength: and make him see things clearly.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the dressing until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not suitable to do that at the time of cure, or immediately after the incision: on the contrary, it is necessary to delay it: because water ascends quickly through a violent aspect.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a hot aposteme occurs: then it is necessary to remove the dressing before the seventh day: and correct it with what soothes the aposteme, until it is soothed: then absolutely restore his sight, and place upon his face an oral application that regulates his sight under those days, while he remains in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him gradually go out of the room, and take exercise in his own quarters.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in this matter the student is not exempt from seeing many times: then indeed he will be confident about the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed it has come to us from some of those who are from Alayrach, who said that a perforated madan was made in Alayrach, which is pierced by water.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But truly I did not see anyone in your land who made it: nor did I read about it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it may be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are forms of species from madan, so that they stand upon those who ignore them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Be made from a proper copper: and let their extremities be with the same subtlety triangular-shaped, and the extremities acute.
Formae magda.	Be fashioned like a chamber.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the treatment of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Head 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When various flesh growths are born in the nose, among which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from them is cancerous flesh, stony, dark-colored; and from them is soft flesh, not dark-colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, among these fleshes that is soft, not deceitful, nor cancerous, you should make the weak sit between your hands, opposite to the ground, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into those fleshes: then draw them outward, and cut what you have comprehended from them with a subtle, acute instrument on one side, until you know that the entire flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If something remains of it, whose cutting away is not possible: then scrape that with one of the subtle instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs: then oppose it with what is necessary: or it is among the malignant abscesses, then prepare to cauterize it, until the blood is cut off and all the fleshes are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then let there be poured into the nose after the incision vinegar and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then know that he is now healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, indeed, the moisture does not penetrate, according to what is necessary, then know that within it is a flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, which did not come forth with the incision of the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then therefore it is necessary that you introduce a thread of linen with some thickness, and knot many knots on it; and place between each knot the quantity of a finger or less: and ingeniously make the weak one insert one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or as much as possible after he has made something similar to a crook; and pull out his mucus until it reaches the cavity and comes out above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times, indeed, boys in schools make a similar thing to this atom; and it is an easy thing for him who wants.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two extremities of a thread, one extremity which emerges above the nose, and another which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then take a ministering or serving of flesh with knots that are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do that until you know that the pieces of flesh are now with knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the thread; and put it in the nose after the blood has been purged away, with the licinium that you have imbibed in the Egyptian ointment; do that for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes away all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put a small tube of lead in the nose at the end of the thing, for some days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it needs a drying cure, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a head-cleansing device, with which oils are distilled and other medicines are administered into the nose, make it from silver or copper: something like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell-shaped instrument to be made for the head-cleansing device should be full and uncovered: which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil in it, or whatever you want from juices and flowing liquids.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Of the treatment for ulcers of the nose.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many times an ulcer originates at the extremity of the nose and grows and increases with days until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that, it is necessary to burn it out at the beginning of its appearance and eradicate all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place on the site, either a cautery, or a burning medicine which stands in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If the incision is slow to heal, until it becomes magnificent, then consider if it is stony, hard, of a dark colour, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous aposteme.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For many times I have seen one who has made an incision on a man's aposteme, and great evil has befallen him who possessed it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the aposteme is of a gentle touch, not of a dark colour, and you see that an incision is possible throughout its entirety, then evacuate the weak part, and make the incision without fear, without hesitation: and treat the site with what evacuates and constricts, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, it contributes little to the operation, unless in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore when something happens to someone from that, that you consider, if it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then join the edges of the wound with a suture: then treat it, until it is healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of continuity are already separated, and each part has become healthy: then it is necessary to excavate every part from its own apparent skin, until it becomes bloody.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join the two lips with a suture, and bind them together, and sprinkle above it the blood of dragon's, and powdered olibanum thrice: and place above the powder a layer of emplastri diafinicon, and one or other of the consolidating emplasters: and leave it bound for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it, and change the medicine: and leave it, until the threads separate by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is to make a continuous solution, or with a hook, as we have described in suturing the womb: or to make a solution with a thread, as I have made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of laborious knots.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people suffer from painful swellings in their own labors, like hard grain-like abscesses: and some of them are smaller, and larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to convert the lip, and to apply a poultice over every knot of it, and to suspend it with a hook, and to cut into it from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with old troty, until the blood is absorbed.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place should be treated with it, where there is suppuration, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the incision of flesh born over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	A flesh often grows over the gum, which the ancients call a bulb.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, it is necessary to suspend it with a hook: or to hold it with forceps, and cut into it at its root, and allow the serum to flow, or the blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put over the place old troty, or other dry, stiptic powders, of an evacuating nature.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If the flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut into it a second time, and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the scraping of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they accumulate on the surface of teeth from the inner and outer part, and between the rough, asperous, and citrine-colored cortices of the gum, until corruption spreads from that to the gum, and the teeth become foul through that.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Here is the translation:
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore something is removed from the beginning of the reasoning, it is good; and if not, then one should proceed with another reasoning on the second day, and the third, until one arrives at the ultimate study in that which is useful.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that a dense bone needs diverse forms of rasping and many shapes; according to what is prepared for your operation: therefore, the rasp with which the density is smoothed from the lower part is different from the rasp with which it is smoothed between the teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And let these forms of rasps be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the Extraction of Pain from Teeth.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you cure the tooth of its pain with all your ingenuity, and be slow in eradicating it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not that the vigor of the tooth is supplied when it is eradicated: because it is a sublime substance: until when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary to eradicate it when it is weakened, so that it may be strengthened and certified by you as a painful dense tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often the pain of a weakened tooth deceives, and it is thought to be in a healthy tooth, and it is eradicated: then the pain does not cease until the weakened dense tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the operation of bloodletting physicians.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the painful dense tooth itself is certified by you, then it is necessary to scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides: then move it with your fingers or with subtle forceps at first gradually, until it is shaken out.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps in a good position on it, and hold the head of the weakened tooth between your knees: what you have already held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight out, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not emerge, then take one of those instruments and insert it underneath from all sides with ease, and feel its movement as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If it is dense and perforated or corroded, then it is necessary to fill that hole with a pad, and bind it with a thin radius extension, so that it does not break during the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary to make a careful incision with scarification around the gum on all sides, much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And control your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and it returns to the weak place from that greater evil which is more painful than its first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do what ignorant bloodletting practitioners do in their haste, and the boldness of theirs beyond its eradication, contrary to what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often bring about great infirmities in men, whose difficulties are that they break them, and all their roots remain, or some of them; or that they extract it with certain bones of the jaw: as we have often testified to that.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it is washed out after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If a flow of blood happens from the places (for it often happens), then take something from a vessel, and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the vessel does not conduce to you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of delicate forceps which are moved densely at first, should be long in their extremities, short in their handles, thick, so that they do not double over when pressed with them on the tooth: they should be like you see of thick handles, until when you bind with them, they do not slip, nor double over: having a short extremity, and made from iron or forged from well-centered files, with straight extremities: and in their extremities there should be teeth, some of which are inserted into others, and bind with decent constriction, strongly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when they are made into extremities like the shape of a bird's beak, which is called a cicATRIX, and they are strong constrictions.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the eradication of teeth and the extraction of jawbone fragments.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains in the eradication of a tooth which is broken, then it is necessary to put on the place a cotym with butter for one day or two days, until the location is softened: afterwards introduce into it an instrument, or forceps: whose extremities are assimilated to the beak of a bird, which is called a cicatrix.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of this is a forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities are made like a file within: or like an Aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not obey you at the exit with these forceps, then it is necessary to hollow out above the root, and to detach the whole flesh, and to introduce an instrument which is called a small Palanca, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be a short extremity, somewhat thick: and let it not be soaked, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular extremity, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the triangular extremity, subtle.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And it is helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which have preceded in the filing of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	And it is a help with this instrument which is assimilated to a large hook, of this form, a triangular twisted extremity, in which there is a certain thickness, so that it does not break: and let it not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and the prudent craftsman, skilled in his art, finds for himself the instrument, according to what is suitable for him, operation and pains.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since they are from painful places and were not mentioned by ancient authorities as an instrument, because of the diversity of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if a bone is broken from the jaw or from other bones of the face, or becomes putrid: then probe deeply into its own place with what suits it from the instruments and forceps that I mentioned in extracting roots, and help it with gestures, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let something of thickness be placed in it gradually, so that it is tightened or held with the bone, and does not flee or slip away, until the bone emerges: and restore the place with suitable medicines for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small amount of decay in the bone, then scrape it clean of its decay, and take care of it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the serration of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Head 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When prominent teeth do not follow their natural course, a foul appearance is made through that form: and especially when it happens to women and girls, namely the venal ones.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore to consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born behind another tooth, and does not occupy its place, or is possible its serration, nor its polishing: then eradicate it: and if it is joined to another tooth, then cut it with that instrument, whose form is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small file, and is made from iron, with a sharp extremity indeed.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cutting be such that you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another is not disturbed among the teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is prominent and exposed to its polishing: then polish it with a file made of iron, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely made of iron, and its handle with many small points, as a file with which needles are made: with which one polishes the tooth gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed and falls out: then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	What if it is dense, from which a part is broken off and hurts the language: then it is necessary to smooth it out and also to remove the roughness of that fracture, and to make it even, and not to hurt the language, nor corrupt the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Concerning the extraction of teeth with golden threads.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth are subject to concussion and commotion from a blow or fall, and the weak one cannot hold on to what it chews so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines and the treatment did not help: then the clever solution is to tie them with a golden thread, because silver turns greenish and decays after a few days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the medium thread be of subtlety and thickness according to the quantity that it can grasp between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the retention is such that you take the thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth: then weave it with both extremities of the thread between the moving teeth, whether one or several, until you reach the web all the way to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving until you reach the part where you began: and tie your hand with subtlety and wisdom, so that it does not come loose: and let your constriction be where you tie the thread, at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the superfluous extremities of the thread with scissors: and gather both, and convert them into a knot: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth, so that they do not hurt the language: then let it be thus tightly fastened until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it becomes loose or is cut, tie them with another thread, and let it stand firm with it for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of the retention of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it happens that one or two dens return to their proper places after a urine case, and are retained as we have narrated, and remain: and it does not happen unless by an artisan skilled, prudent, and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when something is prepared from the bones of a suckling: and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in its position, where the tooth is strengthened and tightened, as we have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When the ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation for this is to open the mouth of the infirm person in your lap, and lift up their tongue: then cut that nerve ligament along its width, until the tongue is freed from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it has come from the consolidation of a wound: then insert the hook into that, and feel it along its width, until you cut the ligament, and the knot is freed.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, lest there be a fissure in the deep flesh, and you cut an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then it is cleansed at the site of the incision with rose water, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a swab of linen, which the patient should hold in place every night: so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply powdered zeolite to the spot.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If, indeed, the blood does not stop, then cauterize the spot with a gentle cautery, which is suitable for that: then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of a ranula that forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When an abscess occurs under the tongue, which is similar to a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function: and perhaps it becomes so magnificent, until it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation for this is to open the mouth of the weak patient alone: and examine the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If you see it is of a dark or black color, hard, which the weak patient does not feel sensation: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it has declined to whiteness, in which there is humidity, then apply a hook to it, and cut it with a subtle spatula, and free it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood flows out during your operation, then put powdered zingiber (ginger) on it, until the bleeding stops: then return to your operation, until you extract it with its completeness.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is washed out with vinegar and salt: and take care of the rest of the treatment conveniently suitable for that, until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of two abscesses of the tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When abscesses occur in the throat, that is, glands, which are similar to almonds, which occur before: and they are called two Tonsils: which when you treat with what we mentioned earlier, and do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If it is a hard abscess, of dark color, little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it also with iron, fearing a flow of blood, or rather leave it alone, until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will perforate it: or it will rupture by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is subtle: then it is necessary to cut into it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation is this, that you consider beforehand your own operation, if the patient's apostema is quiet and completely warm, or it is diminished by some diminution: then indeed make the weak person sit in front of a light, and their head should be in your lap: and open their mouth, and receive the saliva between your hands, and press their tongue downwards with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made from silver or copper, which should be subtle like a scalpel.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you press their tongue with it, and the apostema is shown to you, and your gaze falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the amigdala, and extract it as much as possible towards the outside, except that you draw out something from the tunics with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, whose shape is this which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is similar to forceps: indeed the extremities of these are curved, so that the opening of each one is directed towards the other's acute angle: therefore take care that it be made from iron or tempered and quenched.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose shape is this.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It is sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other according to the same type of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, gargle the weak person with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however a flow of blood occurs to them, gargle with water in which the bark of granatorum has been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar things from styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then take care of them, until they are healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when other apostemas are born in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut therefore those two equally according to what I said in the incision of the two equal membranes.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I indeed had treated a woman who had an abscess, which was born between her throat, which was pulling towards the dark color, little sensation, which had almost closed off her throat: and the woman was breathing with difficulty from the constricted passage, and already forbade her from eating, and drinking water: and already she was approaching death, if it had remained one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had only risen, which had sent out two branches, until they emerged through two openings of her nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I prepared therefore a rapid instrument, and fixed it into one of the hooks.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I drew it out, and a large portion was pulled out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off, where I had grasped it through the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did to her what proceeded from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: and afterwards I fixed the hook into the abscess: then I cut off a part of it, and hardly any blood flowed out: the throat of the woman was freed, and she began immediately to drink water, then took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not cease to cut into that abscess many times over a long period: and the abscess succeeded in its place what I was cutting, until it was prolonged excessively and with that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I resorted therefore, and cauterized the abscess in her throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood therefore from then on: then I walked away, and did not know what God did with it afterwards beyond me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the Incision of an Abscess of the Uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the uvula and becomes an abscess, and it is long: then it is called perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a uuva.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we have mentioned in the division, and treatment does not help, you see that a hot aposteme has moved away from it, and it is subtle: then it is necessary to cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is gathered from it is round, and it has no length, and it is bloody, or of a dark color, or black, and it has no sensation: then it is necessary to make a deep incision into it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in it there is fear above the weak place.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore when you see it according to the method which I mentioned, and its length, so that you make the weak place sit before the lamp: and press its tongue with an instrument, whose description has preceded: then fix a hook in the wound, and draw it downwards: and cut into it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned for incisions of two glands.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut into it, unless that which is added above the natural term without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut into it more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use what we have narrated about in the incision of two glands: and care for it, until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If, however, the weak place is terrified by the incision: then it is necessary to use artfulness in its cauterization without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in it is not, unless with sharp water: and it is, as you place the head of the weak place on your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press its tongue with the instrument which I mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterization, and mix with it a lime not extinguished, and put it not thick, nor subtle, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, whose shape is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	The extremities of the area where the medication is applied are concave, like the concavity of a spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with medication on the same ulcer: and let the patient sit sideways, so that the saliva flows out of his mouth from the inwardly applied medication, so that nothing descends from it into his throat, and hurts him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medication.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you apply it to the ulcer in a moderate quantity for a half hour, until you see it already blackened and soothed by the biting of the medication.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to receive the pus, and wrap it around the extremity of the radius, and pour the pus with medication, and insert the radius with the pus into a canal above, until it adheres to the pus on the ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you want from the cautery of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it alone: for it will dry up and fall off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to repeat the medication, repeat it: and after cauterization, clean around the ulcer with a butter-soaked cloth, and purify what is around it from the medication: and cool it down with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And let it be treated externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore, this type of treatment is safer than incision and farther from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when the ulcer is treated also with something that is more subtle than cautery and incision: it is treated indeed with fumigation, in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calament, and hyssop, and origan, and rue, and sseah, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar herbs to these: and gather all of them, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be coated with clay, and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, on which the concave instrument is placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made from silver or copper, and the extremity is introduced into the place where there is a granulation, into the mouth of the weak [area], until the vapor ascends to the ulcer above the canal, until the ulcer becomes greatly obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then it is turned over the same place many times, until it scars.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you make this treatment at the beginning of an abscess that has not yet come to a head.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For a poultice is added to the abscess, and it is not fitting to make that unless at the decline of the abscess's heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a reed, and apply the bark of it to the extremity, so that the weak area is not burned; because the bark of the reed prevents the vapor from burning the area: and this is good treatment with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Concerning the extraction of spinal roots and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times it adheres to a bone in the throat, or a fishbone, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore to extract what is apparent above what falls under the sight, after you press the tongue with an instrument at the root, and it is revealed to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the weak area vomit before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the weak person swallows a fragment of turnip, or the root of lettuce, or swallows a morsel of dry bread; or takes a fragment of dry marine sponge tied with a thread, and then swallows it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it reaches the place where the bones or fishbones are, and is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument made of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	The thick one is slightly shorter than the Radius, and its extremity is curved, which it easily inserts into its own throat with ease: and itself has its head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let it touch its own epiglottis, so that it does not cause a cough, and it propels with it the mouth or the spine, or the physician inserts it by hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	However, when the weak person inserts it, this is better: on account of their knowledge of the place adjacent to the thing; and they propel from below, or draw their hand with an instrument upwards, that whole thing according to the quantity that is prepared for them, until it emerges.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extraction of a blood-sucking insect (or leech).
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the leech is applied with what I said earlier in the division from the cure with medicines, and it does not work, then consider the throat of the weak person in front of the sun, or at the sun after you have pressed its tongue with the instrument that I described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If then your vision falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with gentle and precise gestures.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with these: then take a curved cannula, and insert it into the throat of the weak person up to the near part of the throat: then insert the iron ignited with fire into the curvature of the cannula.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times: and let the weak person abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a treated full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech falls away when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If however it does not emerge with what we have described, then fumigate the weak person with steam, or with a copper instrument that I described for fumigating the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do it many times, for that very thing will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in suffumigation is to receive a vessel, in which there are burning coals with fire: and let the vessel be covered with a covering, in the middle of which there is a hole: and let the extremity of the instrument be composed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then apply the suffumigation, and let the patient place his limb in the extremity of the cannula, and close his limb, so that the suffumigation does not escape, until you know that the suffumigation has already reached the blood vessel.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the blood vessel will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the suffumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the patient be hungry and eat salty things and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that it should exit with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the blood vessel is extracted from the guttur, when it falls upon the same vision.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is introduced into the guttur.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is roughness of lime: when it comprehends something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their section, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many species of abscesses, of many modes, according to the remembrance that comes from them, namely one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation and section, which is from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is of the species of abscess in itself, and that which comprehends from humidity.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is on account of the places, in which it happens through the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since an abscess occurring on the head is different from an abscess occurring on the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in a joint; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among the abscesses are those which should not be perforated unless after maturation of the pus in them, and their completion; and among them are those which should be perforated while they are raw and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like abscesses that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Since an abscess, when it occurs near a joint and prolongs its existence, until it putrefies what is around it, perhaps corrupting the ligaments or nerves of that joint; therefore it is the cause of a more pronounced contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a principal member: since if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either the limb itself or the principal member through that limb.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, so perforate it while it is still immature: and it is not fitting to perforate a raw abscess, not completely digested, unless it is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply and reach the interior of the anus, and a fistula forms, or it ends in what cannot be healed.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary to know the time of perforating an abscess, which has matured according to its completion: and it is at the subsiding of pain, the recession of fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess: and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary to make the perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and at the prominent elevation: and let the perforation be directed in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the tendons, and the cartilages, and the nerves, and the arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflexion.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those cases where reflections occur, a passage is made with a secondary perforation according to that membrane.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When an abscess is located in fleshy areas, it is better to delay the perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to the accompanying treatment.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you perforate it before that, the flow of pus from it is prolonged, and there is much foulness and filthiness, and perhaps its lips will harden, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body in case of necessity, or according to that which the membrane needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is fitting to administer a small perforation in small abscesses and a large perforation in large abscesses, or many sections according to the similarity of the magnitude of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses in which it is fitting to sew up the skin: and an incision should be made when it has already become like a pannus, and has formed at the terminus, which is now dead tissue: as happens in many cases, such as ulcers and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And among them are those that are cut with a triangular incision.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And among them is one which is incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf figure.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are those in which a round incision is administered, and a lunar incision: and similar ones according to the incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That one which has no head, such as are superficial abscesses, it is fitting to perforate it with a superficial perforation, or only with a flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is fitting, when the abscess is large and has already collected much matter, to perforate it so that you do not press out and extract all the pus at that hour; rather, you should extract a portion of it from itself.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then apply a poultice to the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something from the purulent matter.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do it many times according to the grade, until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old and decrepit person: for the animal spirit is often resolved with the egress of sanies; and perhaps the weak person will die, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Beware therefore in this chapter great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, by which you have made an opening into the abscess, it is necessary to cleanse the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or it is a flat section, then apply a linen bandage, or an old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and there are many openings of the perforation, then it is necessary to insert a linen bandage into every opening, until they reach the adjacent skin.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, or have concaved it around: then it is necessary to fill it with old cloth, or as when a fabric is woven, or lined with a woolen thread without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then put it aside, and take care of it with what is necessary from an ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked into the cloth: and place it many times over the site of the bleeding.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If however the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary to administer a regime and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places of this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If however it is in winter time, and the site of the abscess is very cold: then it is necessary to pour poultices with wine, and warm oil: and place them over the site.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it should be in summer, and the locations are fleshy: then it is necessary to apply poultices soaked in water, or wine and oil, and all that coldness.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary to dissolve the aposteme, and to cleanse it, and to administer in its treatment what is convenient for it, until it be healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of universal treatment of apostemes.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the method of distinction, I have already spoken about every type of aposteme, how it is a path to its specific and individualized treatment.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	About the excision of apostemes that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Head 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Apostemes that occur on the skin of the head are small and are of the type of Nodes, which are contained in pouches, which are like husks of hen's eggs.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many species of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are fatty; and some contain moisture similar to that of mud; and some contain moisture similar to that of frost and pus; and some are similar to these, and some are hard and stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the excision of all of them, and their removal is not feared, as long as during their excision it does not cause a counteraction of the artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their excision is, that you should try it with an instrument whose form comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains moisture, then dry it out in the excision according to the length of the superficial incision: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the incision from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then scrape out the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything deep within it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns if something remains from them.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then submerge the cotum in Egyptian unguent, if it is available; and if not, in water and salt; and fill a ulcer with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it corrodes what remains from the kisti.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply the Egyptian ointment to the cotum a second and third time, and if you desire it, until you are confident that nothing remains from the kisti; then treat the ulcer with an ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the aposteme contains a fatty node, then dry it according to this method, having the shape of a cross-section; and apply scarifications between the two labia of the section, and excoriate it from every part; and take care to extract the tunica that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, the artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly, act on the aposteme if it is stony, from the section and cure, in the same way as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section above a stony aposteme is easier, because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain apostemes of these that are on the head in some men, with which there is no hidden moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is to say: because I cut above an aposteme on the head of a old woman, and I found the aposteme like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if someone struck it with something projecting, it would wound him.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other cases of aposteme accidents on the head, besides these, namely the apostemes that occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the section of all of them should be a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of sanies is directed downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with what is suitable for their cure from treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Concerning the surgical procedure on the throat in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the arm-pits, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And those that occur on the neck are one and many; and they arise from inward causes; and every tumor on the neck is inside its own proper tunic, just as it is with knots and abscesses of the head, as we have described.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these tumors of the neck.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And among them are stone-like ones; and among them are those that contain fluids; and among them are malignant ones that do not respond to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, when you find one of them that is good and well-disposed to the touch, whose color is close to that of the skin, and it moves freely in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, nor is it deep: it is necessary to cut into it superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b. to line g., and to excise it from every side: and to extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks if needed, as we have said in the case of abscesses of the head, and to extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is with caution, so that a vein or nerve is not cut into.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the instrument be not too sharp, so that you do not apply your hand with the incision, or disturb the weak part, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you cut into a vein, or an artery, and it prevents you from operating, then apply to the wound a dry powder of zegi, or some powders that staunch blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acute pain of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens; or else it begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For when blood is poured out from the Tunica of Redi, therefore proceed to your operation, until it is complete.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inspect with your index finger, if anything remains from the small Strophuli; therefore cut them, and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	What if there is a large vein in the root of the Strophula: then it is necessary not to cut that Strophula at its root; rather it is necessary to ligate it with a double thread strongly, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the hollow of the old wound with Egyptian unguent, which you have already mixed in.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole Strophula is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the two lips of the wound: and they will settle immediately, after you see that there is no excess remaining.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that excess remains because of the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary to direct yourself to cutting its root, and extracting it: and administer the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what contains moisture from the Strophuli, pierce it with a superficial piercing: so that you may see the place of its maturity: and put the piercing from what follows below in the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the piercing a dressing with ointment, and similarly to them, so that it corrodes what remains from the corruption, until you see the wound is already clean: then take care of it with a generating ointment of flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Concerning the section on the Epiglottis, which has become inflamed inside the throat due to an abscess.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients spoke of this section on the Epiglottis, and I did not see anyone in our land who has performed it: and this is the writing of their discourse.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those having suffocation, it is necessary to make an incision of the Epiglottis, since there is no benefit through that; because all the veins and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those indeed who have a hot abscess in the mouth or throat or two tonsils, when there is no sickness in the canal, it is necessary to make an incision of the Epiglottis, to flee from the destruction which happens due to suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary therefore when we want to do that, to cut the Epiglottis under three circular rings of the Epiglottis, or four, with a small incision in width, in that which is between two circles in quantity, so that it is a section in the sifa, not in the cartilage: and this place is suitable for an incision, because it is deprived of flesh, and the blood vessels are far away from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the doctor is timid, then it is necessary to stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should probe the skin until he reaches the canal: he should avoid the blood vessels, if he sees anything from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the sifa as we have described: and it is indicated by a section of the canal from the phlegm that comes out of it, with what is discharged, and by the separation of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the wound remain open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the time arrives in which suffocation is feared, join the two lips of the wound together, and sew it itself alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medications that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Said Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this sermon which we have narrated is not an explanation, unless when they see that some of these apostems have already affected the weak throat: and the weak one was elevated above death, and wanted to interrupt his breathing: they hasten to cut the Epiglottis, so that the weak one may breathe again at the place of the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason they have ordered to leave the wound open, until the evil of the disease is consumed, and it is an evil of three days, and as if itself: then therefore they have ordered to sew the wound, and to take care of it, until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw through my own observation is that a young girl swallowed a knife, and it went into her throat, and pierced with it a portion of the pulmonary canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to her cure, and I found her groaning, as is the groaning of the dying.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I examined therefore the wound, and I found blood which had flowed out from the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was therefore confused, because she had not severed a vein, nor an artery: and air was escaping from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I treated it accordingly, and I sewed up the wound, and I cured it, until it was healthy: and nothing happened to the young girl except hoarseness of voice: and she returned after some days to a better state of her health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that in the cutting of the Epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the Cutting of Throat Hernias.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 43.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess called Throat Hernia is a large abscess, according to the color of the body, and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two modes: either it is natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one, certainly there is no ingenuity.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one, indeed, is according to two modes: of which one is similar to fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an abscess that occurs from the knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in that there is fear, and it is not fitting to make a premature assumption about it with an iron instrument, unless it is small: and you should prove it, and investigate it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty knot, and it is not suspended with any of the veins: then cut it off, just as knots are cut off: and remove it with what it contains from the sac, if it is in a sac: and if not, then thoroughly examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with what is necessary for the cure, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On the excision of nodules by species.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many species of nodules, and I have already described all their species in the division; and it is necessary for me to describe here the difference between a nodule and an excrescence, since there is confusion.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore that when there is an excrescence, there is heat and fever and violent pains, until the inflammation subsides and the putrefaction is complete; then indeed the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But with a nodule, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains a kistis sifachin, which is its own sac, and is according to the color of the body: and its containment is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a swelling, and it is greater or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two species: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of the moisture are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the cure of a nodule, it is necessary to examine it and inquire into it first with an instrument called an introgressor, according to what will be described in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiring into apostems and all nodules is that you take this instrument and introduce it into a humid place which you find in the apostem; and you revolve your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then finally, you measure your hand according to the size of the apostem.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then extract the introgressor and consider what comes out in its investigation.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore a flowing moisture comes out, whatever the color may be: then dry it with a superficial incision, according to what I said about other apostems.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not exit in the wound that has been opened, then you will know that it is fat: so make a section on it having the shape of a cross, according to this shape as I have shown you; and suspend it with hooks, and excise the skin from every part with ease; and keep it still if you can above it, so that you may extract the sound tissue with a knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the tissue is disintegrated during the operation and it is not possible to extract the sound tissue, for this often happens, then extract it fragment by fragment until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or much of it remains, the knot returns according to the greatest part.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Which if it defeats you and a little of it remains: then fill the wound at its completion with certain sharp corrosive powders; and bind the wound, and place above it a warm apostema sitting, and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore there is a large knot, then sew its two lips together, and treat it with that which incarnates.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however there is a contrary pulsating vein, or not pulsating: then prepare, and fill the place with a triple bandage, and leave it tightly bound for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies, and the ebullition of the blood subsides: then return to cutting what remained of the Knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning the forms of instruments for section and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	These are the forms of instruments that are thrust in, and they are of three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For there is a large one among them, and there is a medium one among them, and there is a small one among them.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	They are made of iron, with a square, extended extremity, so that they may be fixed in an apostema (compress).
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Experiments, that is, piercings: and one of them is called "baris", that is, a piercer: and they are of three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For there are large, medium, and small ones among them.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suitable for investigating through these affected areas, and ulcers, and fistulas, and abscesses that come from the bones among them.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, tight, smooth, like large needles which have an edge underneath, namely from citrus wood, or from copper, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones among them are those that are made from citrus wood.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And they make Experiments also from black lead, which are suitable for experimenting on fistulas, whose concavities are reflections, so that they reflect with their smoothness together with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because there are long ones among them, medium ones, and short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and its stricture.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of probes, and they are of many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because there are simple ones, namely those with a single curvature: and they are of three species, as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And among them are obtuse probes: and they are of three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And among them are probes having two curvatures, and they are of three species: and among them are probes having three curvatures, and they are of three species: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of Scalpels, with which they cut and scrape away Knots and affected areas: and they are of three species: because among them there is large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which they make a section are acute, other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed thus, unless so that there may be help in scraping away Knots with fear of incision into the vein or nerve: and so that it may be healed through them, and find tranquility for a short time after the inflammation which it finds at the scraping away of the affected area.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the Mada, and they are a species of three.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of copper, and they resemble a file, with which one makes alcohol; and at the end of the broad spatula there is a hidden point: and it runs inward and outward when desired, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The forms of the spatulae that are hidden between the fingers at the site of the affected perforation; and they do not perceive these things in weakness; and there are three species, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of the vessels with which the flow of blood is stopped; and there are three species, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of copper or brass, rounded, slightly longer in length, as you see; and they should be subtle.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that you have these species of vessels, large and small; so that you may stop the blood flow through them with speed when there is a need, and then when medical help is not present for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you should not use them in stopping blood flow at every location of the body, and you should only use them in fleshy areas: such as the muscles of the thigh, and hip, and muscles of the arms, and breasts, and abdomen, and groin, and similar fleshy areas.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are made into small instruments similar to those with a circular form, according to their shape: with which blood is stopped when it flows from the location of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery; and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Concerning the treatment of breasts in men that resemble those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men become inflated during the complement of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in their sleep), until they resemble those of women; and they remain shameful apostemes.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Who then abhors that, it is necessary to make an incision above the nipple in a lunar shape, following this form from line a to line b, and then to excavate the entire fatty tissue.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards, fill up the wound with a medicinal poultice of incarnation.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and take care of it, until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the nipple declines downwards, and becomes soft due to its size, as it happens with women: then it is necessary to make two similar lunar-shaped incisions on both sides, each of which is connected to the other at the edges, so that a larger line contains a smaller one, following this form from line a to line b, g. Afterwards, excavate the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fatty tissue, and administer what we have said about sutures and poultices, which is necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If however you do not complete the incision as it is necessary to make, due to the anxiety of the patient, or due to a flow of blood: then it is necessary to fill up the wound with a submerging corrosive ointment, and leave it, until it corrodes away what remains of the fatty tissue.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the perforation of an abscess that occurs beneath the arm-pits.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur beneath the arm-pits are of the species of hard Strophuli, which contain cysts, and among them are those that contain humidity.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those therefore which are among them that contain humidity, it is necessary to make an incision with a lunar-shaped section, following this form, from line b to line g, so that all that is in the abscess is evacuated from the pus, then fill it up with old cloth, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the wound should be opened and treated with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	What if the abscess was of the type of nodular swellings, then scrape above it, as we described in the section on nodular swellings, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the wound extends to this point so as to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we have said previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the section of an abscess that occurs because of the Artery and Vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is broken and the skin that is above it becomes consolidated, then often an abscess occurs there; and similarly it happens with the veins as well, so that an abscess and inflammation occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is recognized that an abscess and inflammation are due to the artery and vein are: when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long and collected deep in the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a grating or scratching sensation.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to the vein is round and visible on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And surgery above this abscess is a mistake, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is a great danger indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to avoid its treatment with an iron instrument, and since it also exists in the extremities or in the head, it is necessary to avoid it.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, on that which exists due to the inflammation of the artery's opening, make an incision in the skin in a longitudinal direction.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with forceps, afterwards the artery; and free it from its coverings until it is visible.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a hook underneath it, and make it penetrate until the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread at two places, according to what I taught you in the removal of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place that is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood that is in it comes out and the abscess dissolves.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment that produces pus, until the ligaments fall away; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If there is an abscess because of a cut in the vein, then it is necessary to hold with your hand what you can from the abscess along with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread, until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie it with a good ligature to the abscess; as I told you about the ligature of the veins, from two parts with two extremities of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however the time comes to extract the thread, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision of theacus: press, and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then drain the abscess in its middle, until what is in it comes out; then incise the excess of skin, and release what was tied up from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on top of it a poultice which you had soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment with bandages and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning the abscess that occurs from twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As an abscess occurs in the Artery and Vein, similarly an abscess occurs in the Nerves; which occurs from blows, or from excessive labor, and similar things; and it most often happens to them in the places of joints, such as the ankle, and in every place where the joints move; and it is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to that of the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain; and when it is pressed with vehemence, one feels in it a weakness similar to numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an aggregated abscess deep within the body, but rather it is beneath the skin, and it moves towards every part, and does not pass to the anterior, nor ahead, nor back to the posterior.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Since that is so, it is not necessary to make an incision with an iron instrument.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps a contraction will occur afterwards.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that case, since it is on the head or on the forehead, make an incision with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and excavate it: then remove it, and bring the wound together with a suture: and treat it, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the excision of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	It happens to certain men often in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, ulcers which are called Fungalia, on account of their resemblance to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is subtle, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned inwards.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is small among them: and it is magnificent among them indeed.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have seen a man, and in his belly there were two ulcers, which were more similar to mushrooms than anything else: there was no difference between them, white, with minute roots, and their lips were turned inwards, and they were covered, and moisture flowed from them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I cut into them, and I found that one weighed almost 10 ounces and the other almost 8 ounces. And the operation of cutting into them is, as you consider then, if the patient is humid, and the color of the ulcer is white, humid, with a subtle root: then cut into it with a broad spatula, and have your cauterizing irons ready in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often indeed a great deal of blood is expelled at that incision: therefore if you are overcome by the blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see a weak and timid patient falter from the incision with the iron, then take a thread made from lead in a decentering way, and tie it with an athel; this is the method we have described, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the stricture of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not cease to tie the lead, as often as it impresses on the wound, until it be cut off, and falls away by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the wound was thick-rooted, then there is something of fear and trembling in its incision: especially because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Truly, it is possible to cut into half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware of presuming to cut into a wound that is of a dark color, little sensation, foul appearance: for it is a cancerous aposteme: and I warn you with remembrance of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of umbilical eminences.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Umbilical eminences occur from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or they come from fissures of the peritoneum, which is above the belly: and there issues from it a fluid or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or they come from blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or they come from flatulence constricted in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If, however, it is due to a fissure of the peritoneum and an issue of thin fluid: then it has a color similar to that of the body, and is soft, without pain: and appears in diverse places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is because of a protrusion of the intestine, then that is its location, with what we have narrated, of a more severe diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a noise with it; and it is greatly magnified at the entrance of the bath, and a laborious pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is because of moisture, it is slack, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor is it added to.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	What if it is because of blood, then with these signs an abscess appears turning black from the cliave.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If it is because of born flesh: then it is a grave abscess, thick, hard, and is shaped according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is because of windiness, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, that you should consider then, if the prominence of the navel is because of blood of the Artery, or Vein, or windiness: then it is necessary to refrain from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and awe, as I instructed you in the chapter, where I said that abscesses are because of the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	What if the prominence of the navel is because of the intestine or a scirrhous tumor: then it is necessary to prescribe for the weak, so that it may hold its breath, and stand upright extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then apply signs with an encaustic around the entire circumference of the navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards, instruct him to take a deep breath between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a broad compress around the circumference of the navel over the place which you signed with an encaustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess upwards, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind it around with a strong thread or with a cord of silk by a firm ligature: and let the knot of the ligature be hidden.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the swollen apostema above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you find it already captured by the ligament: then extract the congealed matter, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly: and if you find a circle, then take it with a hook, and cut above its superfluity.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, an artery or vein is opposite to you: then surround it greatly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two hooks, and insert them into the two strong threads: and insert two hooks around the circle you made around the apostema in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the apostema in four places above the hooks: and if it is useful, remove the hooks, and leave the place until the extended rotten flesh falls off by itself: or cut it when it is separated and rotted.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is suitable from ointments, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	What if there is a prominence of the navel from the raw flesh in it, or from moisture: then it is necessary to concave the apostema, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	On the treatment of CANCER.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of Cancer, and how it is a way to its cure with medicines: and beware of it with its cure through iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and we have spoken of Cancer generated in the matrix, and caution from its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that when Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: such as Cancer which is in the breasts, or in the hip, and similar ones, located in limbs to be entirely removed: especially when it is a small beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When a wound is old and large, it does not need one to approach it closely.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I was not able to heal anyone from it: nor did I see another before me who had persevered in that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to open and release the weak part from black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then a blood-letting instrument should be applied if you find it full with manifest overabundance.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weak part by preparation, in which it is located with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then apply to the ulcerous sores that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	After that, clean it from every side with a knife, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but press out the place, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or as much as possible there with instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the flow of thick blood makes a contrary action against you from the incision of the artery or vein: then cauterize the vein, until the blood is staunched.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the Treatment of Hydrophobia.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we will describe the division of the species of Hydrophobia, and how the gathering of water occurs: and the signs of each species, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is not only a single species of ascites: and it does not approach the species of tympanic diseases with iron: nor the deeply hidden species of hypochondria: for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of Hydrophobia, tympanic with medicines, and your medication has not been successful: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient has already been weakened by debility, or is afflicted with another disease besides Hydrophobia: such as if it is accompanied by coughing, or dissolution of the stomach, and similar things: then beware of medicating him with iron: for that is fearful.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If you see a patient with an excessive abundance of virtues, and there is no illness present except for hydropsy alone: and he is neither a boy nor an old man: then the method of operation in this case is that you stand behind him, placing your hands on his sides, and your assistant presses his abdomen with his hand, forcing water towards the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spinal spatula, of this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It is a tool with two pointed parts, long, with a pointed extremity, like a Spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, there should be something of shortness in it, so that you do not penetrate too far with it during the operation up to the intestine, and harm it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of hydropsy is from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend with a section from the navel by a measure of three fingers, downwards directly above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the generation of hydropsy is due to an illness of the liver: then let your section be on the left from the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is due to the spleen, then let the section be on the right side: and it is not necessary also that there should be a section above where the patient wants to lie down, so that excesses do not flow back to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument through the entire skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into that section, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and make a separation, as if you were excavating it: and let the amount that is excavated be the amount of a nail, or around that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce in a separating manner until the spatula reaches the empty space: and it is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and introduce into the opening an instrument, which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made from silver, or copper, or gold alloy, smooth, polished: which has a small hole in its lower part, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side and one on the other; and its end is cut obliquely, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: and at its upper end is a little arm.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately over the instrument, and thus evacuates from the water at that time a moderate quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate from it more than is opportune, perhaps the weak patient may die at that time by a resolution of his vital spirit: or a syncope which approaches death may occur to him.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the pulses of the patient signify to you about his disposition, and from his goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it is retained immediately on account of the skin which retains the hole that is above the sifac: about which I spoke, so that you may perform it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on another day, if you see the patient can tolerate that: and withdraw also from the water a small quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that on several days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there remains only a little from the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you operate on the patient, and let out a large amount from the water: then treat him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in the bath and sun, and wait upon his condition: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I narrated previously.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the treatment of infants who are born with unperforated urinary places.
Caput LV.	Head 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When some infant is born from its mother's womb and the head of the mole is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is therefore necessary to assist with the perforation immediately after birth with a very fine spatula, according to this method.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put a small lead key in the opening and tie it: and hold it thus for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore it wants to pass urine, it is removed, and the flow is established.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put in the lead, it is now possible that the urine which accumulates above the location does not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He, however, whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those, however, in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are lamented.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because in those who are born, the opening is at the end of the head of the mole: therefore it cannot flow to the front, until it raises the mole with its hand to the upper parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is it generation for them, because the sperm cannot reach the womb according to rectitude: and it is a foul and very loathsome disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation for that is to rest the weak person on their back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the mole with your left hand, exerting strong force, and cut the head of the mole from its proper place with a needle or a fine pointed spatula: as it is an incision like a reed, or as you scrape something, so that the middle part comes out similar to the head of the mole: and so that the opening falls in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware lest there be a flow of blood during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For indeed it often happens that thing.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Resist therefore with him what cuts off the blood, and cure the wound, until he is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning the ulcers that occur on the glans penis and head of the foreskin, and the corruption, blackening, and adherences.
Caput LVI.	Head 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These ulcers often occur on the penis, and it is a prominence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And of them, some are malignant, and some are not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	You should therefore treat the non-malignant one by suspending it with a subtle hook, and cutting it off, until you cleanse the entire thing.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on top of it a covered compress soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound itself afterwards with dyaphenic ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the ulcer is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after the incision and removal of its roots.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and part of the ulcer is within the foreskin and part of it is outside, then you should remove the ulcer that is inside first, until when it consolidates, then treat the outer one; because if you treat them both at once, the foreskin will not be secure unless it is prefabricated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now they also occur on the testicles, and there is blackening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	It is necessary, therefore, to excise all that has already become blackened and what wants to corrupt or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply on top of it afterwards a liniment made with honey that has been mixed with flour of roasted granators and powder of triturated herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If a flow of blood occurs, then apply a lunar cautery with the cautery in this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	The cauterization is a helpful remedy for two conditions at the same time, namely for a flow of blood and a wound when it becomes corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the ulcerated head of the vein is corroded, and everything is destroyed within an hour; then it is necessary to introduce into the mouth a small cannula made of lead, so that the weakened patient may urinate upon it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the vein, and this adhesion does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy and does not require circumcision: and when an adhesion occurs due to a wound or aposteme; it is necessary therefore to excoriate it with a blunt Spatumili until the ligament is loosened and the head of the vein is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern those things precisely, then it is necessary to excoriate something from the head of the vein and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	Because the foreskin, when it is subtle, is perhaps perforated on account of its own subtlety, quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin from the head of the vein with a subtle linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated with a tightening wine, until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that occur in their accidents.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution for continuity, like other wounds: however, since it arises from our operation, our will, and its use is especially in children, it is necessary that we mark out a better operation and a lighter way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: because they did not use it in their laws and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Here is the translation:
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have indeed already tested all these methods, and I did not find a better purification with cauterization, and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in purification with a branding iron, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin has two layers: therefore perhaps the outer skin is cut and the inner layer is touched; thus it is driven to make an incision in order to cut the other, and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when purification is done by touching with the fingers, that is, digitally, which surgeons use, they do not worry about an external incision of a vital member; because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in purification with a scalpel, perhaps the iron will putrefy and corrupt your operation; and indeed the skin of a child is brief by nature, and often they are born in such a way that they do not need purification; and I have seen that already.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	Purification with cauterization and binding with thread has revealed a good experiment to me; because the branding irons are proportionate to the incision: therefore, what is above is like what is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When therefore you press your hand, the two edges are proportionate, and they meet according to one operation at one time; and there is a compression of similar figure, containing the skin of the limb from every part, with which no error falls entirely.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of operation is to make it seem external, especially with a child, if he is one of those who understands for a short time, that you do not do anything unless you bind the thread on his limb only; and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way possible to you, because he receives his own understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be sitting; and hide the branding irons in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into its scrotum and support it on the skin, and draw it upwards, until the head of the scrotum emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from what has accumulated in it filthily.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, bind below it a second ligature, somewhat lower.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger, and with your thumb retain the place of the lower ligature in good retention, and make an incision between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and extract the head of the scrotum.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better), and put powder on top; and above the powder a cloth in which the yolk of an egg cooked in rose water has been spread out, mixed with fresh rose oil that is good: and leave it on until another day: and take care of it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	This is the formula for a cleansing ointment.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two extremities be numb and let them be inclined, so that no branch of a nail emerges from them, and let the length of the two be equal, as the length of two wrists is equal.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	There is an error, indeed, in the cleansing, for perhaps the entire inner skin has escaped, or part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you stretch it out from your hour with your finger before the suppuration of the place, and make an incision according to its equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you are not able to hold it with your finger, then extract it with a hook, and make an incision.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days have passed and the swelling under the scrotum remains inflamed, a suppuration: then leave it until the warm suppuration settles, and scrape it off with ease, and make an incision according to what is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the scrotum.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, treat it with what consolidates the wound from powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders; and if it is incised above a measure from the skin, and evacuates upwards, it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it with what we have said, until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of a retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction made by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or born flesh, and similar things from those which we have mentioned in the modes of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine does not flow, and you see that its retention is due to a stone, which is now in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for him to be bent over on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he should stretch out his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and the patient should strain his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, pressure is applied to the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone towards the back: whereupon the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not released with what we have said, and the situation is severe for the patient: then it is necessary to administer the extraction of it with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose shape is this: made of silver, subtle, smooth, concave like a cannula of a bird's feather in subtlety of radius, long in likeness of one and a half palms; having a subtle cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of urine exit through it is this: that you receive a double thread, and tie at its extremity a wool or a plug, with a good ligature; and you introduce the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe; and incise with forceps if something overflows from the wool, but truly introduce into the cannula with violence, like an eaglet.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then apply a poultice with oil or butter, and to the affected area: and make the patient sit on a seat, and anoint the affected limb, and apply the poultice with moist olive oil, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the poultice into the affected limb with ease, until it reaches the root of the affected area.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then apply a double layer of it above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the poultice into it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has already reached the empty area: and this does not happen according to this order, unless the passage, through which it passes, is one where there is twisting.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend a thread with a piece of wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the wool will follow the thread.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it, and make the thread flow through the passage of urine: and repeat the poultice, and do not stop doing that until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Regarding the quality of the bladder's cleansing with a Clyster.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is confined in it, and there is a need to distill waters and medications into it: then it should be done with an instrument called a Clyster, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which is what pushes it, should be according to the quantity that it needs without addition, until when something is drawn out with it, it attracts from the humidities: and when it is pushed, it expels to a distance: according to what the Clyster does, through which naphta, that is, Greek fire, is projected in the praetorian martis.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you wish to inject moisture into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the Clyster into the moisture, and draw with it what propels towards the above, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the Clyster.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its extremity into the rod, according to what we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push the moisture with what pushes it, for the moisture quickly reaches the bladder, so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of the Clyster is subtle, by which the bladder is clystered.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or gold alloy: its head should be slightly higher, like a small hook, and underneath it a curve where the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a goat, and put moisture in it, so that you may clyster the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two curves of a strong ligature with double thread: and warm that moisture slightly above the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the Clyster into the rod, afterwards grasp your hand over the bladder with the moisture, with a suitable compression, until the patient feels it, because that moisture has now reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if a bladder is not present to you, then take a piece of parchment, and make from it a circle, and pierce it throughout its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into those perforations, as they are turned around.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle together, as it is gathered into an alsufra: afterwards you put in it what you wish from the moistures, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder from expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	Of the Extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	I have described in the division of species of stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have described the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys, and in the bladder, and its signs in the whole body; and I have described the stone on which the operation falls with hand and section; and it is a stone generated in the bladder properly; and he who is struck by the rod; and I am narrating that with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that a stone generated in the bladder, most often happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is that the urine emerges from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety; and it appears with white sediment, and the weak rod is rubbed, and it labors with it, and often hangs.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it erects itself, and emerges with it to the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is an easy healing for boys, from the fact that they are up to fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In the young, however, it is moderate, in that which is between those: and whose stone is larger, the treatment is easier; and if small, its care is conversely.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we arrive at the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the weak area with clysters, which extracts all the feces that are in its intestines; for it prevents the detection of the stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the weak area is taken with its feet, and it is shaken, and moved downwards; so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or jumps down from a high place many times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands are under his hips, so that the whole bladder is inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then press on him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then at once with haste take a section above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	What if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger with oil of your left hand, if it is a weak boy: or the middle finger if he is a complete youth: and insert it into his anus, and feel for the stone until it stands under your finger: and turn him around slowly to the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger, and push it towards the outside against the place of its section: and order the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and order another assistant to stretch out the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand, to remove the skin which is beneath the testicles in the part where the section is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert a spatula, whose shape is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left side of the hip: and let the section be above the stone, and your finger should be in the anus: and let the section be transverse, so that the outer section is wide and the inner one is strict, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to come out from there without being larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed the finger compresses, which is in the anus, the stone at the section, and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that the stone has angles and edges, wherefore its exit is difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And it is smooth, similar to a gland, and rounded: and its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore add to the fissure for those which have angles and edges.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	What if it does not come out thus, then it is necessary to contrive over it: or to bind around it with a gesture of decent art, whose extremity is like the Moon, which binds around the stone and does not leave it: or to insert beneath it an instrument of subtle curvature.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot operate above with it, then enlarge the opening a little further.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	What if something flows from the blood, cut it off with a scalpel.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there is more than one stone, then push the largest first into the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Next, push a small one after that; and do similarly if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	What if it is very large, then ignorance is to cut above it with a large section.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because it happens to the weak one of two things, either that he dies or that he suffers from a continuous dripping of urine; therefore, because the place is not consolidated at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But truly administer its expulsion, until it comes out; or use your ingenuity in breaking it with forceps, until you extract it bit by bit.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with turpentine, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and sprinkle it, and put on it a cloth infused with oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water; so that a warm apostemum may be induced.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then prop up the weak person on their neck, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, bathe the place with water, and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with dyaphinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however a warm apostemum is added to the wound, and it corrodes, and similar things; as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prohibited from it; and that is recognized by the emission of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore introduce your finger into the wound, and extract the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes the corrosion of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then apply a poultice made with vinegar, water, and salt; and oppose it to every type of wound that is suitable for its cure, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the hours of treatment to bind two hip bones together, and to assemble, for a cause of medicinal remedies that are placed on the spot.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	What if the stone is small and is located in the middle of the urinary tract, and it is fixed there, and prohibits the exit of urine: then cure it with what is narrowed before you arrive at the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times indeed you will excuse yourself from the section through this treatment, now indeed I have proven that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, to receive a Perforator made of iron alloy, whose shape is this, a triangular pointed extremity, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and bind it with the hip bone under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the perforating iron into the hip bone with ease, until it reaches the stone: and turn the Perforator by hand in that very stone little by little: and endeavor to make a perforation of it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine is indeed released immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the hip bone.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It indeed breaks apart, and comes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prohibits it from that: then bind a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on that very hip bone between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards release the binding, and clean the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to bind the thread under the stone, unless so that it does not return to the bladder: and another binding above, unless when the thread is released after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and closes the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to do that when you bind the thread above, to elevate the skin upwards, so that it returns to its complement, and closes the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the Extraction of Stones in Women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is rarely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if it happens to any of them that a stone forms, then the treatment is difficult and is prohibited because of many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	The cause of theirs is: because the woman perhaps is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second reason is that you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a doctor, when she is chaste, or among those having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third reason is that you do not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with her hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth reason is the remoteness of the location of the stone: because it requires a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	Because if necessity leads to that, then it is necessary to take a woman doctor, well-informed: and she is hardly found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you truly desire those things, then seek a chaste doctor, subtle and well-informed, and present a midwife experienced in women's affairs, or a woman who has acquired part of the art: make her present, and especially entrust it to her, so that she may do all that you prescribe to her from the inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, it is necessary to examine if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary to introduce a finger into her anus, and to seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore he finds it, he should grasp it under his finger, and then instruct the midwife to introduce her finger into the womb of the weak woman, and to inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand on the bladder, and presses it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore he finds the stone, then it is necessary to gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all his might, until he reaches it at the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then let him be seated on the opposite side of the middle of the vulva at the root of the hip, from whichever part it is prepared for him, and he feels the stone in that part; and his finger does not move away from the stone, constricted beneath it; and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then insert a rod upon that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he feels the stone, then let him add to the second incision a quantity proportionate to that which the stone emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among them is the small one, and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long, and the round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its kind, that it may be signified to you through this on account of what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood overflows you, then add to the affected place a triple bandage, and hold it for one hour, until the bleeding is stanched.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone emerges: and make sure you have prepared yourself with the instruments I mentioned for extracting stones from the bladder, so that you may be assisted by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with a decent ligature of poultices: and do not move it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood settles down after days, and the place putrefies, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	About the incision above the watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The watery hernia is not anything except an aggregation of humidity in the white vein, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg, and it is called a siphac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in its own little cloth, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the ovum, until it is putrefied: because it is another thing, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white albumen, as we have said: and it does not happen unless rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this ramification is from the debility that occurs in the testicles: because this material is poured out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it happens from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this humidity has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For it is either a pale yellowish color, or it is blood-red, or faecal, black, or it is watery-white, and it is that which is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white albumen that we mentioned, then the abscess is round in length for a short time, like the figure of an ovum: and the testicle does not appear, because the humidity surrounds it on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the humidity is in its own little cloth, then the abscess is round with a part of the ovum, and on account of this a man thinks that it is another ovum.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white albumen, then it falls under perception.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you seek the cognition of the color of the humidity, then you experience the color of the humidity in the abscess with an introjected square, whose form has preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that which proceeds from the investigation of the Introjected, judge concerning that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the cure with iron, then it is necessary that you precipitate on the weak part, so that it may be phlebotomized if possible, and you see its body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should lean back on his back on a high place a little, and put many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on his left side, and order the assistant to sit on his right side, who should stretch out his rod to one of the two lateral skin flaps of the buttocks, and to a portion of the stomach's membrane.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and dissect the skin flap from the middle along its length, up to the perineum: and make the incision straight and equidistant from the line that divides the skin flaps, until you reach the white membrane surrounding it: and excavate it and observe, or be cautious about this, so that you do not injure it: and let your excavation be on the part that is suspended with the ovum plus: and carefully examine with the excavation according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the membrane full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two labia of the section with hooks, and extend the membrane upwards, and do not touch the skin flap that surrounds it: and incise the membrane as much as possible for you to incise it, either in its entirety or partially, especially the subtle part beneath.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there will be no security in the incision, lest the water returns.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the ovum proceeds to come out of its skin during your operation hour: then when you have completed the section of the membrane, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two skin flaps of the buttocks with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as you would other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	But if you find the ovum corrupted by blackness or other things, then it is necessary to tie up the veins that are its suspenders, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the buttock with its suspender, and extract the ovum: afterwards treat it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if water has accumulated in the two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore dissect the other part equally according to what you did in the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that it may be one operation, then do this: afterwards abstain from blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce a woolen thread soaked in oil or rose oil: and put before it another thread which you had soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and strengthen the belly: and put above it doubled cloths, and they are poultices: and tie them above with a ligature, which has six threads according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are applied, and they are soaked, and they fill with a non-carmine lotion, according to this similarity: and they make extremities which are pressed from a pouch, or damp wool: and they are gathered with a strapping in the lumbar region of the arms: and one extremity receives above the hip up to the back, and the second receives towards the part of the chest: and two extremities above the two hips below, and two other extremities above the two groin areas, and the whole strapping is gathered in the lumbar region of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when these extremities are artificially medicated with a cautery at the place of the incision with iron: and it is, that you receive a subtle cautery knife, and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according to what we have narrated: until when it is detected, a white album containing water: then receive the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	They are assimilated to Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that album, and it is ignited, until all moisture departs.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch out the album with hooks, and scrape it with a subtly ignited cautery, and cut into it according to what is possible for you, until you eradicate all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware lest you touch it with fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is more saving, and farther from the flow of blood, and better than an operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If indeed an opposing condition makes itself known to you at the time of surgical incision, or at the time of cauterization, or a warm aposteme, or a flux of blood, or something else: then it is necessary that you should cure what makes the opposing condition, along with the treatment that is suitable for it, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if the patient is faint-hearted and does not expect to survive this operation, due to its horror: then administer the perforation according to what I describe, and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you through what we have said about the signs, that the humors are watery: then it is necessary that you should make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then make a perforation into the lower part of the abscess with a broad spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let there be a wide opening, until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put a compress on the affected place, and bind it, and let it stay until the remaining water flows out: then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is an obstruction to the flow of water at the time when you make a perforation: and it does not happen for any other reason, because the white membrane causes an opposing condition at the orifice of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which to extract the hydropic waters, whose form has been described previously: or add it in the operation of the wound for a short time.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or around that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it has accumulated, then it is necessary to puncture it again in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Concerning the treatment of a fleshy abscess.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the incision above this abscess, it is due to a pervasive fear of causing harm in many dispositional arrangements.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal is to be saved from those things.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am mindful of the operation in it, and the species of abscesses.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in bodies, from which lumps are composed: and it happens for many reasons.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from an acute surplus or sharpness, which is poured out into the lumps.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a grave abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone-like abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the knotting of arteries, and their inflammation: as I have already mentioned in its remembrance: or from the inflammation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Which therefore is from the inflammation of arteries, is recognized by the arrangement of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary to touch it directly.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which happens from the inflammation of veins, does not disappear at all with compression by the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section be made about this species, and about the remaining flesh: and it is, as if you were cutting into the skin of lumps.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the skin upwards, and extract it with a white sifach: and free the suspensory from the veins, and bind the veins: and incise the suspensory after you have freed it from all parts of the skin.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the skin is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary to draw back the skin, and incise it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between something from the siphacel, or in what is between the veins: then it is necessary to free the entire adhesion, and incise it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however there is a growth of flesh at the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to make an incision throughout all of it, and extract the tumor, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore the operation is complete, then apply a dressing soaked in rose oil and wine; afterwards treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the treatment of fractures, which is with Vite.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 63.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is a hidden abscess, similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles, and it makes movement and exercise difficult for the patient, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this disease, there is fear because of the previous memory of what preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	However, it is necessary that we describe the operation in this according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that it is necessary for you to make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then apply a poultice to the lower testicles.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with vessels that are near the veins; and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them with a vigorous stretching.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a broad, sharp scalpel, making a transverse section directly into the vessels, until they are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then remove everything from every side, as we have told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Next, place a thread in them where there is a double filament, and tie it first to the places where the Vites meet; and tie it again at their ends.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them off in a straight section in the middle, according to the length of the body, and extract what has accumulated from foul, corrupt humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which it is necessary to generate a healthy humor, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not an evil through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If, however, it happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary that they be extracted on account of this: so that the eye may not be deprived of its nourishment, because of the incision, and become dry, or wither away, and there may not be a remedy with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the treatment of an intestinal rupture.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The cause of this rupture is from a blow, which occurs in an extended area above the navel on the part of the groin from a stroke of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Because the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from a blow or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a fall, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy thing, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the symptom is when it is from an extension of a blow.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is what occurs gradually over a long period of time and does not occur suddenly: and it is an equal abscess towards the deep part: therefore, because the blow compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the symptom of it when it is from a blow, because it causes sudden severe pain from the beginning: and it is a diverse abscess, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the external area of the blow.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it goes out with the intestine a little piece: and this is called intestinal rupture, and hernia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes feces runs into the intestine and is retained there: and it is with that a very harmful affliction: because it causes severe pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this type of illness with an iron instrument, there is fear: because it is necessary to beware of accidents in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is to press gently on the affected area, so that he may reduce the intestine with his hand to its internal concavities.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it will be placed back onto its neck between your hands: and you will lift up its legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch out the skin that follows the skin to the upper areas, and cut the entire length of the testicles along their longitude.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then place the two labia of the perineal section, according to what is necessary to open up the section with them: and let the section be according to the quantity that is possible, so that it may emerge from it an egg.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape away the sipnach, and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until when the white album is detected, hard on every side: then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, in what is between the white sipnach, which is beneath the skin of the egg, and between the sipnach according to, and completely separate it from the adhesion that is in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the interior of the skin of the testicles: and with this stretch the white sipnach upwards, with your left hand: and lift the egg with the sipnach to the part of the section: and instruct the assistant, that he should stretch out the egg upwards: and you release the adhesion, which is behind a complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And examine with your fingers, that there should be nothing there from the intestine wrapped up in the hard white sipnach.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find something there: then push it down into the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a thread, on which is a thick string, made into a licinium from ten threads: and insert it at the posterior sipnach, that is, the tunic, which is beneath the skin of the testicles following the section: then cut the extremities that emerge from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them above others in a cross-shaped pattern, and tie with alsifach, which we mentioned earlier, because it is under the skin's tender ligament, so that nothing from the ulcer can seep out to nourish them, lest a warm apostema develop.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put the second ligature outside the first ligature, at a distance of less than two fingers from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, release from the alsifach, which is under the skin's tender ligament, an amount the size of a finger: and cut out the entire remainder according to its roundness, and extract the humor.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut below the skin of the testicles, where the blood and serum flow, as we have described in what has been mentioned before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply a woolen dressing soaked in oil, and put it on the wound: and apply the ligature that we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the alsifach is cauterized with the white substance we mentioned, after the incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens that way.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, the case is delayed, then it should be fomented with warm water: and put on it what we mentioned, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	On the Treatment of Varicose Veins.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this varicose vein, I have not seen anyone who has dared to attempt its treatment with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first ones certainly said that it would be as we described in the case of varicose veins with vitiligo.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is to tie the vessels below the section with facility: then cut in the middle, and treat afterwards with what opens them, until the vessels fall off: and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	On the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and a place protrudes, but nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it does descend, it is small, and returns at all hours. But if it is prolonged over time, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this occurs from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Because it is extended: then it becomes soft and putrid, and the place swells and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as was previously mentioned in its description.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with an iron, according to this method: and it is, that the patient lies weakly on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the ruptured and swollen area, applying pressure across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then bind the alsifak and what is beneath the skin, until when the white sifach is detected, which is beneath the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a scalpel and place it on the prominent place of the sifach, and press it deeply into the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then make two prominent places on the end of the radius from the sifach, and connect one of them with the other by a suture; then extract the end of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the alsifak at all, nor stretch a vein, nor anything else, as I have made you aware of in the treatment of an intestinal rupture.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have made an incision, clean it, and restore the wound, until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the sifach is constricted, and the prominence of the Rupture does not increase.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cautery is better in this place, since it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in certain men, because the flesh that is between them becomes soft and their appearance is disfigured.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who is seeking a cure for this condition to make the weak area rest on his back, and to incise the entire skin that has become soft over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he should bring together the two lips with a suture: and if it is necessary, he should first remove the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and make a firm suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then he should incise between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then he should take care of the remaining wounds with a treatment, until they heal, and the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that Castration is forbidden by our law: and because of this, it would be lawful for me not to mention it in my book: and there is no need to mention it, except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when he is questioned about it: and so that he knows the treatment for one who has suffered it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other method is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our own benefit through it, such as goats, hyraxes, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that Castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by fissure and section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is this: we make the animal sit in warm water, until its testicles become soft and relaxed, and hang down; then we rub them with our hand, until they resolve and do not appear to the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration, it is necessary to hold the animal firmly and to press on the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensor, and cut above each testicle in one section, until two testicles proceed: then incise these after you have removed both, and do not leave anything above them except a subtle sifa, which is above the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something in the testicles, and therefore the animal desires coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On the treatment of Hermaphrodites in two modes.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	The Hermaphrodite is treated from the urine in two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	The sign of theirs is, because it appears in what follows, either in the skin of the testicles, or in the region between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine runs out from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In females, however, there is one form, and it is a woman's vulva above the perineum like small men's testicles entirely, protruding to the outside: of which one is like a man's priapus, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three species, two from men and one from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the excess flesh, until their impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them for the remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine flows out, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the incision of the Twitching [or Hernia], and of the protruding flesh in women's vulvae.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Perhaps the fat is added to the natural thing, until it becomes foul and its appearance becomes repulsive; and sometimes it is even magnified in certain women, until it expands like in men, and reaches up to the groin.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	You should therefore hold back the excess of the fat with your hand or with a hook, and cut into it: and do not delay in the incision, especially at the deep root: so that there is no flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care to cure the wound itself, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But there is also a type of flesh that grows in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it: and perhaps it emerges to the outside according to the likeness of a tail: and because of this, some people first call it a "tail-like" disease.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, we should cut into it as we cut into the fat, and take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Concerning the treatment of a prolapsed womb that is not perforated.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	A prolapsed womb is when it is a womb of a woman not perforated, or if it has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	The accidental one is from a preceding illness: and it indeed occurs either from flesh that has grown added, or from thinness, or from tension: and it occurs either in the depths of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or lower part: and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the recognition of it is made by the obstetrician's examination, if the obstruction is apparently close at hand.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then you should examine it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the obstruction is from thinness and is close to the two labia: then push gently and break it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as you place above two swollen lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place the tips of your two hands there, and let the woman sit on her back with her knees extended.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the subtle suture is disrupted, and the opacity is opened up.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a linen cloth, and soak it in oil, and place it on the location: and let the woman do this every day, so that the place is not consolidated with another ulcer.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the suture is thick and dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a broad spatula-like leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the opacity is born from native flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and incise it: and have with you medicines that calm the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus aggregated with white albumen.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a tube of ample lead, so that the wound is not consolidated quickly, hold it for some days: and administer a dressing of dry linen, then let the rest be cured with usual treatment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when there are born in the womb carnal nativities of other flesh: therefore it is necessary to incise according to this method: since it is not a cancerous aposteme, for an aposteme of cancer that is in the womb does not contradict with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athelil, and red ulcers on the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed the opening of venous orifices, so that much blood flows out from them constantly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	Since therefore hemorrhoids are ancient, they become habitual: and I have already spoken in the division of their species, and their signs: and I will say here which ones receive a cure from them, and which ones do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the matrix, and do not appear to the senses; then it is not suitable for him to be treated with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those of them which are in the opening of the matrix on which the sense falls, are those that can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then stretch out the uterus with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them out from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over them at the flux of blood from one powder of incisions without causing pain: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, put her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and quince cortex, and gall, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is cut off with it, it is good: and if not, make them adhere to the back with ventoses, and breasts, without scratching.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and soak it in the juice of tarathita, or the juice of agnoglossa, or the juice of willow branches, that is, of aglantine, of Pontic wine, and make them adhere to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the aposteme has quieted down, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The Albarth indeed is a red substance similar to the heads of alhaasse, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut away what appears from it, according to what I said in the lil equally: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	On the Perforation of the Rectum which occurs in the Matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of tumors occur in the matrix, such as cancer and stone-like tumors, and ulcers, and putrid matters, and lividities, that is, herpes, a kind of ulceration, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot tumors.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already described all these diseases and their species, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary to discuss in this treatise the hot tumor which occurs in the matrix, when it is one of the tumors that collect bad blood, and it is useful to know how its opening is made with an iron instrument.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is therefore necessary to consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the tumor in its inception is acute with percussion and inflammation, and fever: and you see it red: if sense falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and cure it with that which aids its maturation, until when the acute accidents quiet down.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a seat that has two footrests, and recline, or support herself on her back, and bring her feet together to the lower part of the belly: and let her hips be expanded, and place her arms under her thighs, and bind them with a convenient ligament to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the matrix is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	The shape of which comes into those that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you administer this instrument, to direct it with the radius of the deep matrix of the woman: so that it may not be that which enters further from the instrument than the depth of the matrix, and harms the weak woman.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary to place pillows on the upper surface of the deep matrix: so that the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the matrix may be prevented: and it is necessary to place a twist, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and to hold the instrument, and to turn the minister's twist, until the depth of the matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the wound appears and is touched by the hand, and it is gentle and soft: then it is fitting to separate it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the blood is evacuated, then it is fitting to put a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and put the cloth, and extract the suppuration from the depths of the wound.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put a clean woolen cloth soaked in water, in which there are boilings of mallows, over the wound and over the area around it.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment that is suitable for that, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the wound and ulcer are washed out, so that it is cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the ulcer has been hidden inside the wound, then it is fitting to refrain from curing it with iron, rather cure it with what we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The doctrine of obstetrics, how they medicate living embryos that have emerged into a form not according to nature.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to recognize first the natural form of the fetus.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From these signs it is evident, when you see a woman striving to press down below, and longing to smell the air, and alleviated above what is above her from the fetus, and hastening the exit of the embryo: then know that this fetus is according to natural form, and its exit is above its head, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, then it is fitting to press down her womb, so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	When it descends upon its head, a second thing descends with it, and it is cleansed of those excessive impurities by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever is beyond this boundary is unnatural, unworthy of praise.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Because when the fetus emerges on its feet, and the body emerges before its head, and one of its feet, or one of its hands: or its head emerges and its hand: or its belly emerges: and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar things from those unnatural shapes.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary therefore for the Obstetrician to be prudent and subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how the intelligence is in it, and it is signified by that, and it stands upon that.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges with its natural headfirst presentation, and it is oppressive to the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see that her strength is already debilitated: then make her sit on a seat, or let the women hold her: and apply warm vapors to her womb with a decoction of fenugreek, and with humid oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Obstetrician inserts a small spatula between her fingers, and finds with it the secondine, and cuts it with her nail, until she feels what is in it from the humidity: and presses the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be clistized with a suppository of fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then advise her to compress herself after the suppository, and make her sniff with a condition, and hold her mouth and nostrils for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will emerge immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus emerge first, then it is necessary to reduce them with gentle facilitation little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If she does not deliver at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat and elevate her feet upwards; afterwards strike the seat against the ground; and the woman should hold on, so that she does not fall during the concussion.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not come out, and the fetus is dead: then cut them, and extract the remainder of the fetus: and bind her hand with a cloth, and extract it with equality: for itself will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The delivery of the embryo on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out onto its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; afterwards, convert the fetus slowly; then balance it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and extend it slowly.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out as far as the hips, then command her to push, so that it is compressed, and make her sneeze with effort: for it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have described, then reduce the fetus slowly, until you place it according to its natural figure.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For itself will come out then with an easy delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	What if it is prohibited with all that we have described: then take from the mucilage of the altaea, and oil of sesame, and dissolved gum: and strike everything in a mortar with good percussion: afterwards mix it with the woman's vulva, and beneath her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water, until she gets a hypochondriac condition.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that the lower parts of hers are already warm, then make her a drink of myrrh: and support it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she holds the drink for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and constrict its mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	The abscess should be opened at once.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The fetus exits over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it emerges in this manner, then one should insert their hands gradually while introducing them little by little.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lean back on her neck, and let her feet hang down below: and she herself should sit on a couch, and clasp her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gently on her abdomen little by little.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then take out what is beneath her feet from the cushions, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take hold of her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the pubic area gently, until the fetus ascends to the top.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert your hands, and gently adjust the fetus: and instruct the woman to press, until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus emerges, hanging widthwise from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	It is introduced into the reduction by her hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however it cannot be reduced, then lift up the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If indeed she is unable to walk, then make her lie on a couch: and strike her thighs with a vigorous concussion.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment that you prepared from poultices.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If it receives the birth, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in the reduction with your hands, and adjust the fetus according to its natural figure: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to press herself, until it emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus emerges over its neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary for the midwife to hold the hand of the fetus, then turn it around little by little, and adjust it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equalized, then place on his wound what we have prepared from olive oil and mucus-like substances.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then advise him to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then have him sit on a seat, and advise him to incline towards his right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then advise him to compress it, and have him sniff with a consonant.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared fetus is turned towards the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then separate the afterbirth with your fingernail, until it is evacuated from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it off from the navel: so that it may not be retained and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inward, until you place it as needed: and advise the woman to compress herself frequently: for it will then come out with an easy delivery.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The delivery of twins, or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is unusual, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five is indeed a thing beyond nature, and they do not live deeply: and they are contained by one afterbirth, even if they are multiple; and they are separated through the navel, distinguishing between them with a tie in the navel of each.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out just like a single fetus comes out naturally, easily: and they come out with an excellent delivery, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	But if some of them are difficult at birth, and they come to what we said about unnatural shapes, then treat them as we described: and let there be a subtle and skilled hand, and it will do what it does with facility and delay, and it will be adapted according to every shape with what is prepared for it from the leading ingenuity towards health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	The reminder of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has been verified by me that a woman aborting gave birth to seven, and another to fifteen, all fully formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was done is the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all this ought to be in the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will happen similarly to that one: therefore, it should be opposed to it with what is fitting.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the division from medicine, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use manual operation, then it is necessary to consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If the woman is of sane virtue and not with any of the accidents from which loss is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be placed on a bed, on her back, and her head be inclined downward, and her thighs be elevated: and the assistant should hold her by both parts, or tie her to the bed, so that her body does not extricate itself during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the womb's mouth with humid oils of musk and linseed, and fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife mixes her hand with these oils and mucilages: then she inserts it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she feels with her hand the place where the cotyledons of the fetus are attached, and finds a suitable location for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend onto its head: then it attaches cotyledons on its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under its beard, or in its armpits, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If it has descended onto his feet, then on the soles and the middle of his ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary to hold the hook with his right hand; and he should place its curvature between the fingers of his left hand; and he should insert it with his hand with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places that we have mentioned, until it reaches a vacant space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he should insert another hook opposite it, or a third if necessary, so that the contraction is equal and does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with an equal extension, and not only straightened according to its original direction, but moved to every part, so that the outcome is alleviated: just as it is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in that which is between them, that the extension is made soft.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part of it is retained, then it is necessary to anoint the obstetrix with some fingers and oil, and insert them from that side, so that it revolves with what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks are changed to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If a hand emerges before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its contraction: then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until the whole emerges, and cut it off either at the joint of the arm or at the elbow; and thus it is necessary to do the same with the other hand and with both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the head of the fetus is large, or if it encounters contraction at the exit, or if water has accumulated in its head: then it is necessary to insert a perforated spatula between the fingers, and to find the head with it, and to extract the water; or to dislodge it with an instrument called Almisdac: whose shape comes with the shapes of other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise, if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary to make an incision with a sudden jerk; or extract it with a misdirected push, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then grasp the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	What if the head emerges and is stuck at the furcula (pubic bone): then it is to be cut until the humidity that is in the chest is poured out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it does not progress and does not obey at the exit: then cut the head a little, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	What if the lower part of the womb is affected with a gathering (abscess), or there is dropsy in it: then it is necessary to perforate it, until the humidity flows out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If indeed the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is stuck at the womb or chest: then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and cut the womb or chest until what is in them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If however the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns: then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb and search for the head with it, and grasp it with her fingers up to the mouth of the womb: then she should insert one hook or two hooks, and grasp it with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	What if the mouth of the womb is stuck, because of a hot abscess that has happened to it: then it is not proper to struggle over it, rather it is proper to administer an effusion of humid and greasy things, and apply a plaster: and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	What if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to straighten it: then administer what we have said about the living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	What if it is not possible, then it should be cut away a little and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything behind from the secondary wound entirely.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said in hot applications that occur in the matrices.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	What if there is a flow of blood, then it should be stopped with aqueous styptics, and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have indeed already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was; then she was impregnated on top of it with another vice, afterwards another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	So a abscess occurred to her after a long time in her navel, and it became swollen, until it opened up: and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called in for her treatment, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I applied therefore on top of it certain strong attractant plasters: and the bone came out from its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed by, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was amazed therefore at that time, since there is no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought therefore that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I examined the wound therefore, and extracted many bones, while the woman was in her better dispositions: and now she lived for a long time, and discharged a little pus from its place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not confirm this strange thing here, unless there is science in it, and aid to that which the skilled physician administers with his hand from treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Concerning the forms of necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is described the form of a Speculum, which is equal to books, having two equal arms at the extremities of two wooden pieces.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this vertigo requires that it be more subtle, and so that it happens, either from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each wood is almost two fingers; and the edge of each of them is almost one finger, and their length is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two woods there are two additions from the same kind of wood, which have already been attached to both, whose length is a half palm plus a little more; and the width of each is almost two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the maternal bone, so that they may be opened with them when you revolve the two Vertigos.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The shape of the Vertigo which is opened by a matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another shape similar to that, more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made from ebony wood or boxwood, according to the similarity of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition from them is almost a palm; and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you want to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a couch, her feet hanging down, with what is between her thighs opened.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two additions joined together into the matrix; and you, holding the end of the instrument below between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity that you want from the opening of the maternal orifice, until the Obstetrix does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The shape of another Vertigo which the ancients called the Form of an Impeller by which the fetus is propelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The shape of Almisdac, with which a large head is treated; and it is similar to forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is made oblong, like a forceps according to this shape, as you see, which has teeth like saw teeth, where it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdac where the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of a hook having a single spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of a hook having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps which has saw teeth, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of a spatula having two extremities for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two broad spatulas also.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are exercised, and the more their species are multiplied, and they are prepared by the craftsman, the more swiftly they perform their operation, and the greater they are esteemed by men, on account of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Do not therefore despise any of these instruments, as long as it is prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For the necessity of them is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Of the extraction of the Afterbirth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Afterbirth is retained in the womb, then it is necessary to precipitate the weak parts, so that it retains its own breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sniff with a concoction; and press your hand on her vulva, and her nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and perforate it in the closed aperture: and put in it herbs opening the womb, such as calamine, rue, and anetum, and chamomile, and sseham, and ligneam cassia, and centaurea: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a pessary of papyrus over the aperture of the pot, and another extremity into the womb: and hold it until the vapour reaches the concavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make it firm, as we have directed.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the second one should come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then order the Midwife to immerse her hand in warm oil of sesame, or in a thick mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert into the womb and feel for it with the Secundina.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore he has found it, then take hold of it, and pull it out slowly.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it was attached deep in the womb, then insert the hand, as we have narrated, until when he has found the Secundina, and pulls it out slowly according to rectitude, so that the womb does not collapse from violent attraction: indeed it is necessary, that it be turned with ease to the right and left sides: then add to the quantity of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It itself will obey then, and will be freed, and will be separated from the adhesions.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	What if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already narrated: treat it with firmness, and from medications of oils with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If however it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then beware lest you fatigue yourself over it in the repetition of the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is truly necessary, that what comes out to the mouth of the womb from it, be tied to the hip of the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then clysterize her with an ointment of tetrapharmacum.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	It itself will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it putrefies, a bad smell rises from it to the stomach and head, and troubles that weak woman.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary therefore that suitable fumigations be administered to her.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancient experienced ones have tried the fumigation of nasturtium and dry figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of the instrument with which a woman is assisted during the retention of the secondines and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from a small copper vessel or from zinc: and let the wide extremity be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be put in place of the pubic area: hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their anuses are not perforated, which have already been obstructed by a subtle skin.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary, therefore, that the midwife should perforate that skin with her finger: and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp spatula: and let her beware of the tenderness, lest she touches it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put on top of it a woolen cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If, however, the time arrives when it becomes obstructed, then put a lead tube in the anus for many days, and let it be removed when the boy wants to evacuate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now it happens that an obstruction of the anus occurs also from the consolidation of a wound or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary, therefore, that the consolidation be cut away, then treated with what we have said about treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The fistulas that occur in the lower part are a swelling and a hardness that occurs near the anus or in one of its parts: and it is one fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When, therefore, that swelling becomes old, it opens up, and a watery fluid, white or subtle pus, flows out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes they are penetrating fistulas from these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, the penetrating ones are recognized by what comes out from the evacuation and flatulence, when the weak person makes an effort to evacuate: and perhaps worms come out from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are those fistulas when they penetrate into a space up to the bladder and up to the end of the virga.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are those penetrating up to the joint of the hip, and up to the node of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that place, however, it is recognized that the penetrating fistula reaches up to the anus, and also from the non-penetrating one, it is thus: you insert your finger into the anus, and you insert a subtle probe into the fistula through the air or iron, when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is twisting in it, then you insert into it a subtle probe made of lead, or a pin from the pins of the horsemen, until you feel the probe or the pin on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it deeply, nor does anything proceed from the orifice through evacuation, nor wind, nor worm as I said: then you should know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladder or to the end of the urine: then its significance is the flow of urine from it, and its prevention by this so that the location may be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If indeed it is penetrating up to the joint of the hip or to the opening of the hip: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting up to the opening: and the discovery of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus always flows out from it: and that medicine does not prevail in it, nor is it consolidated with an ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure: and the treatment of them is labor and vanity to him, from foolish doctors, on whom it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that one, however, which is not penetrating and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a serum: according to what I narrate to you, and I have already tried: and it is thus, that the invalid lies between your hands on his back: and lift up his legs above his hips, and let his hips be inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then they should insert a lead probe, or one of copper, if there is twisted tortuosity in the fistula, until they know where it turns.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If however you feel it is weak around the nail, then it is necessary to insert your finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If you feel the probe having penetrated through the ulcer detected by itself, beyond what you feel between your finger and the anus or flesh; then you know certainly that it is penetrating: do not struggle with it, since there is no healing of this sort, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They have said that it can be healed in some men by flesh, and from the medication by which they hope for a remedy, it is to apply subtle cauterization according to the width of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and insert the ignited (cauterized) part into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that two or three times, until you know that all those added and filtered fleshy growths, which are like a bird's feather quill, are already burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with linen wraps soaked in butter, until those burned fleshy growths are discharged: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is thus healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it is never healed by another cure.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe emerges and has not reached as far as your finger, which is in the anus, and there is a thick, fleshy or membranous barrier between it and the probe: and you see the fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut away the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will be separating with the probe that is in the fistula, until the separation reaches where the probe's extremity has reached, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those fleshy filaments that resemble the quill pen of a bird, so that nothing remains in them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however the blood overcomes you, and separates between you and your operation, so that it divides those fleshy parts: then it is better to do what is fitting, and to hasten the healing, to cauterize it with fire, or with acute medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because the cautery with fire adds good habits, to the scorching of those fleshy parts that are added, and to the separation of blood, and to the drying of moistures.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with a wrapping of linen soaked in butter, or with tritated poultices, until the place emits pus, and those scorched fleshy parts go out into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, generating hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there are astringents and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then already they are healed: and you do not fear relapse.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has already penetrated to the deep part of the anus, and is prolonged from the surplus of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and explore with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a tension, and between you and it there is a thin membrane of sifa or flesh, and it is near to penetration: then there is no operation on that, unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because one of the three modes is administered to it: either you cauterize it, as we said: or you divide it, until you arrive at its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert a linen and a cure from near.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cutting, lest you hurt the surrounding tissue of the anus, and cause a bad outcome of evacuation without control.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we said earlier.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: or you will lengthen it with a bandage, and cleanse it after you have cut it up to the bone, as we have described, or with a probe, or with another sharp instrument for the extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh wounds that are in the incision, until you can see through them with a thorough examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then consider the restoration of the whole wound with the incision, and the upper orifice where it is consolidated; and a remaining open fistula will be in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when it becomes a Fistula in this manner: and it is, when you insert the probe into the Fistula; and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take the perforated probe of the extremity, which is like a sharp point, that is, preparing the skin according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a twisted thread made from five threads, and encircle it with them.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the Fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it penetrates into the margin of the anus internally near, then draw out the thread from that orifice: so that you insert your finger into the anus and pull out the extremity of the thread, and join the two extremities together: and tie them both, and leave it for one day, or two days: and as the thread is more embedded in the flesh, tie it well, until those flesh wounds which are between the two extremities of the thread unite and close up: then treat the wound, until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the orifice of the Fistula does not penetrate: then make it penetrate by whatever means are prepared for you, unless it is deeply embedded.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	You should not try to force it, lest you push it further in and do not succeed in cutting it out.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	For a spiny fistula which is found in the spine, whose curvature is acute and strong, and the other part is not acute, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows out through the incision of them, and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two modes.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are inside the anus, similar to vesicles of charcoal, or pomegranates; or as if they were grains of wheat.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And among them are small ones and large ones; and blood always flows from them, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and on its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are mostly of little humidity, from which a watery discharge flows, or a little blood in a steady flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of those that are inside the anus is to press on the weak part so that it may be driven out; and it is pressed until the anus goes out, and the threadlike fibers appear.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, you should also suspend them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them off at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If however they are not held back by the hooks, due to their humidity and softness; then take them with a rough cloth or with a doubled lane cloth, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them off, and sprinkle hot powders over them after the incision, so that they may take the place of a cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	What if the anus does not obey the exit of the clyster, then a weak clyster should be inserted into it, where there is a small biting sensation, so that it may be loosened with what is in the anus, and it quickly obeys the exit, when the weak person excretes.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however the intestines are extrinsic from the anus, then their affair is light, easy: and it is as if you catch them with your finger, or catch them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And he who abhors an incision with iron, then it is necessary that you should administer their suture according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a twisted thread, and insert it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw out the intestines upwards, and make them penetrate with the thread at the root of it from the other side: and twist the two ends of the thread on the lower part of the point, and let them be crosswise: and constrict the intestines with a strong binding.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and pull out the point.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do that with all the intestines, and release one from them: nor let it be its own, so that it may flow out excess blood from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put on the anus a cloth infused with rose oil or cerate, and put it on the anus: and advise the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it alone, until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the intestines have fallen out, treat them with ointments and the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the Treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For it often happens from dryness of the feces and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they are antiquated and medicine does not avail in them, then it is necessary to scrape them with the points of a spatula, or with your finger, until they become humid, and the superior crust which prevents their consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them, until they consolidate according to what is suitable.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate: then treat them with a more vigorous treatment than before, until they bleed much and are evacuated; afterwards treat them until they are healthy.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inverted wounds, and not of inverted ones: and thus for lacerations, and for ulcers.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You know that Almirmar is nothing but a round node according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the entire body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and it causes pain while walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut what is around the nail, and to grasp it with forceps or with a hook, and to eradicate it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat that: and if you want to cauterize that according to what was mentioned in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From lacerations, however, one is a small, rough, fissured, rounded prominence on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is to stretch out the laceration, and to cut into it: or to bind it with a silk thread: or with a hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you want, cauterize it according to what was previously mentioned with fire, or with sharp medicine: and now the inverted lacerations are eradicated, and not the inverted ones with the instrument that I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A ulcer, however, is also a small, fissured, rough prominence on the surface of the body, eating deeply into the flesh: and when it finds cold, it is felt as if bitten by an ant, and it occurs throughout the entire body: and most of them occur on the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a tube from the feather of a goose or a strong vulture's feather: and place that tube over the ulcer, until it contains the circle of the tube with parts of it.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then revolve your hand with a cannula until you reach what is in the circumference of the abscess; and put it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the abscess from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do that with a cannula of copper or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Place the upper part of the cannula at the limit of the swollen and twisted area, so that it is lifted above the finger's grasp and its own rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the abscess according to what has been mentioned in the chapter on cauterization by Athelil.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Of the forms of instruments that are administered for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for solutions of the belly, and for colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When an enema is made of silver, or of gold alloy, or of fused copper, or of hammered (metal).
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when it is made small and large from these instruments, according to those for which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, what is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose anus is weak or painful, thus also their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The tube of it, that is, the upper head in which the ligature is tied, should be large according to this mode: and let there be a distinction so that the ligature is tied as you see, and the lower extremity which is inserted into the anus should be smooth, that is, not open, gentle, indeed, drawing to subtlety: and on one side of it there should be two small openings, and on the other side one opening.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the small openings be according to the thickness of the roots, and let it be slightly smaller, and let the ligature be in which medicines are placed from the bladder of an animal: or from papyrus, which is according to the form of a small asafoetida: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it is perforated with many holes as it revolves, and let there be a space that is between all the holes the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread made from raw thread, which should be of ten threads or around that, and tie it with a uterine ligature as in the manner of astringents.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore it is placed in the uterus, let it be tied at the head of the cluster between two distinct constrictions with a strong binding.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then clusterize with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of a circular uterus depicted here, and of its holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of clustering with it, however, is this: that you should fill the uterus, or a vesicle with medicine, which should be warmed according to the amount of tolerance of the patient: and beware lest it be too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should be placed on his back, and his legs should be elevated above: and place under it a mattress, that is, a leather cushion on which men lie, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the extremity of the cluster with oil, or with egg whites, or with a foam-like substance from fenugreek, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the assistant take hold of the uterus with both his hands at once, and press it out with force, until he evacuates everything that is in the cluster into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then extract the cluster, and raise the patient's legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine seems to be bringing him to an exit, then let him hold on as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all that night, it is more useful in the healing process.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If however you clusterize him in the solvents of the belly's ailments, and hasten the exit of his disease: then repeat the clustering, until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids in the anus or painful swellings, then a subtle and gentle ointment should be applied from those ointments with which children are anointed.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a subtle ointment above, on account of the skin being tightly stretched.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the healing of head wounds without fracture of bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head 83.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	Here I have said in the division of healing of wounds which was convenient for the book, and I will say here their healing with manual treatment, and with medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore that wounds are diversified according to the way they are made and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the things by which wounds are made many times are like a blow of a stone: or an incision with a sword, or a knife: or a percussion with a lance, or a wooden beam, or an arrow: and similar to these from many other things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	However, wounds that are made according to the locations of the body are such as a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver: and similar ones from these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am describing the healings of certain wounds, so that I may put in order and set a rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I begin with simple head wounds: because the composition of remedies will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture of bone: consider then if it is from a blow of a stone or similar things, and has already broken the skin only: and it is a large wound, and there are superincumbent apostemes of hot inflammation: then hasten and perform phlebotomy on the head at once: and do not delay it: and extract from him according to the quantity of his strength: if nothing prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood which flows out from the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let bloodletting be from the opposite part of the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	Let the weak person beware of replenishment, and wine, and coarse foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If something prohibits diminution, then it will be diminished by food, and does not approach the flesh, nor is it wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put on the wound if there happens to be a hot aposteme, a cotton pad soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is stiping.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are free from the hot aposteme, then put on the wound if it is recent with its own blood, and has not changed the air; powder which I will describe soon: and if it has already changed the air, then put on it some ointments until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large, or is from a cutting incision, and similar: and its lips do not gather together through small ulcers, then gather them with a suture, according to what I will describe concerning the wounds of the belly regarding their suture.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound has already been discovered to be from a bone, and it hangs, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspensory bandage: then incise it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medications, and restore to it hard flesh in place of skin, and especially instruct the weak person to take foods in which there is grossness, such as are heads and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulse: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	What if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then incise the whole putrefied area, and cast it out: then treat that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If there is an artery in these wounds, or a vein from which blood flows: and it cannot be stopped by medications, then tie above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not to be cut, then dry it with a Spatumili, or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if necessity calls when it does not concur with what we have said, then cauterize it, until the blood is separated.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If the wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, light: so that you powder them with this powder; because it consolidates them before they change into a worse condition.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of Incarnative Powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe one part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unextinguished lime: grind everything together much, and sift: and fill the wound with it, and constrict with good constriction, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then sprinkle it on top with powders, and leave it, without loosening it while it remains, so that it does not become infected.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not eradicated from it until it heals.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it happens that lime alone does the same thing, when you do not have olibanum and dragon's blood present, and also dragon's blood performs the same operation in many great wounds, when it is convenient to apply it to them and sprinkle, and they are recent wounds with their own blood, which has not changed into a worse condition.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	What if the wounds have already become worse through some alteration, especially when it is in the summer season, then this powder's intention is not in its position: therefore take care of it with what we have said, so that you apply certain digestive ointments to them: or apply poultices made from barley flour, mixed with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the remaining wounds with treatment, until they heal.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it happens that a fracture occurs with a wound on the bone, and it is small, then extract it with Gest: and I will now describe the treatment of fractures of the head in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference between it and a head wound when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If the nerve of the neck has been cut, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no ingenuity in it, unless treatment is given to it with what causes vehement stitching, such as zinc, and zei, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not apply anything cold to the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most sublime of the members; and it is thus that it is treated with gentle medicines, such as a soft poultice infused many times with sweet water, or with rose oil, and tutia, when washed also with sweet water; and the remaining mineral stones, according to this method, and humid unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then administer a suture: or bind its lips with poultices.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound has depth, or a sinus has formed in its lower part, where pus is already gathering, then puncture it in a more depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	What if an artery has been cut in the wound and its blood flow has followed: then separate or ligate it, and bind it: or cauterize it, if necessity demands it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If the vertebrae of the neck have been injured, or the whole, and the jugular veins are preserved: then bring together the lips of the skin with a suture over the cane of the neck, and do not touch the neck, but equalize it, and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments in which there is stitching and excision, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then probe it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them, or what you can from them: and what is not prepared, leave that, until the wound putrefies, and its passage is separated and evacuated.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	What if the wound is fresh, then powder it with the powder that I described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If it appears there is bone in the wound and it becomes a fistula, then treat it with that which I mentioned in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On wounds on the ribs.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a thrust of a lance or a dagger, and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore bad air emerges from the wound, when the patient is short of breath because of it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	What if it has not reached depth, and is fresh with its own blood: then do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it tightly, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the patient: but put an attractive ointment on it, and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If you do not have an ointment at hand, then put a clean cloth on the orifice of the wound, so that it absorbs what emerges from it due to humidity: and make the patient sleep on the wound, so that what accumulates in it flows out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed three days or more have already passed for the wound, and no spasm has occurred to the patient, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the remaining dispositions of it are good: then know that the wound is healthy.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Treat him therefore with bandages and the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing of it is excavated, and now it always opens, then you should know that a fistula has been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Treat it therefore from its source.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a thrusting incision, or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the breast, or back: then treat it with what has preceded from suture, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If, however, it has made an impression on the bone, and a fragment has broken off from it: then probe the wound, and prepare to extract that fragment, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If, however, they are not separated, then leave them, until the wound putsrefies, for extraction of them is alleviated.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment of other accidental wounds in other limbs regarding treatment is the same as what we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning wounds of the abdomen and the egress of the intestines and their treatment.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs in the abdomen is great, moderate, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great ones, it happens when the intestine emerges, or a portion of the intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore their introduction and their suture is more vehement and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also becomes difficult in another manner.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows therefore, that the reduction of them is more difficult, if you do not promptly restore them to their place at once: because they become inflated, open up, and enlarge: for this reason their entrance becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Because of this, therefore, a moderate disruption is better: since with these there is no difficult reduction of the intestine, as it is dissimilar in these two species.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You should know that the suture of the abdomen is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are suitable for a suture of the belly, and for a suture of other wounds of the body; and two other sutures properly communicate with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, there are more proper ones for a suture of the belly; and I will describe each one to you with an explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, because when the wound is small and something protrudes from it out of the intestine, and it becomes difficult to reduce it; then that is on account of one of two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said; or because there is inflammation in the intestine on account of the coldness of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is so, then it is necessary to warm it thus, that you may apply a sponge or a moist cloth in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you steep it in water with cyperus, and cardamom, and spica, and embrocations with that intestine, until the inflammation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When it makes a wine in which there is astringency; and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	Since you see that the inflammation is already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which has been decocted either marshmallow or mallow.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through that, its entrance is alleviated with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however it happens that its return is excavated after this cure, then find a small opening in the disruption with an instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than cutting: and there is no need to cut after necessity and deficiency of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	There is one part of it which is twisted, acute, and another part not acute, and the extremity subtle is not with the subtlety of a spatula, indeed it should be more obtuse for a time; and that is the one which resembles a reed, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the wound is enlarged and the intestine is ingested, then it is necessary to reduce it according to its natural form in its own proper place, if possible, because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the disruption is large in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary to make the weak person lie on their back, and place their knees higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly, if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then direct your attention and consideration to this, so that the part where the wound is may be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And it is necessary to administer it in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that the pious minister who holds the entire disruption in his hand is present between your hands, and join the lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then take away from it what follows after the suture, something after something, and this is the common method of a single suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you should receive the needle, or the number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's amplitude.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then measure from the edge of the disruption the quantity of a ring finger, that is, of a doctor; and fix a needle beyond what you introduce into the thread in the two ends of the skin, with the two ends of the suture beneath the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from another part, and now you have joined two ends of the skin, and two ends of the suture: and four orders are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then bind with a double thread around the needle several times from both parts together, until the two lips of the wound are joined together by a decent union.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then release the thickness of the finger and also fix a needle in them: afterwards return it with a thread, just as you did with the first thread.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease to do that with the instrument which you have chosen from the needles, until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the medium-sized needles be between thickness and fineness: because subtle needles very quickly pierce the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin: on account of this it is necessary that they be medium-sized in fineness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not fitting that the needle be inserted into two adjacent extremities of the skin to a great extent: so that the flesh may not be quickly pierced, and the wound may not be opened before its consolidation, and they may not be stretched out even with the suture, so that the wound may not be prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the end of the thread, so that it may not harm the weak part during its sleep: and put little pads made from cloths on every side, which hold the ends of the thread: and leave them until you know that the wound has already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of suture with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because a single needle suffices for their suture, or two, or around them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second common suture is to gather with the suture four extremities: two skin extremities and two superficial extremities in one place, with a needle in which there is an equally wound thread in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, return the needle to the part from which you started, so that the thread returns to the superior part of the wound: so that it may be a suture, just as the suture of cloth which is stitched together, and place amidst the entire suture the quantity of thickness of the smaller finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	These men know how to suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And when I treated a wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and there was a major disruption of the wound the size of one palm; and about two palms of intestine had come out from the middle of the intestines, and there was a disruption in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I then reduced it after the intestine had stood outside the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was then consolidated in a period of about 15 days: and I treated it, and he was healed: and he lived for many years after that, enjoying his own faculties.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle, because I did not treat him with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where no ointment was found, nor anything from medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore applied an old cloth over the wound twice a day, and continually cleansed it with honey water, until he was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now describe two proper species of suture according to the narrative of my speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you begin with an acute suture: and you introduce a needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle has penetrated into the flesh, and into the connecting wound along the length and width of the whole body: release the extremity of the thread on the side where you introduced the needle, and make it penetrate from the inner part to the outer part in the other extremity of the thread.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extremity of the thread from the outer part to the inner: and release the extremity of the thread, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the other extremity from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration, by which you make it penetrate into the extremity of the thread, which is in that part, until it penetrates into the whole.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then cut also from this same side, and with it the extremity that is from the skin on the other side, and extract the point that has penetrated the skin.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce it to the skin, and with this extremity of the skin that is on the other side, with this extremity mirach; and extract it from the skin which is from its part, and make it one vein, and another: and make it one vein after the vein, until you have extracted the whole extremity according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that you sew the skin of those who have split skins: so that you make one vein from one part of one extremity of the skin: and so that you release another vein from another part, until it is complete.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of proper suture, which Galen described.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech of his is narrated, so that you sew it according to similarity, as some physicians sew them, so that they gather all the parts together to compare their natural fitting: and apply the extremity of the skin to its other extremity, and the extremity mirach to its other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I narrate to you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary to fix the point in the extremity of the mirach close to you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner part alone: and release the two extremities of the skin.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn back the point, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner part in the two extremities of the skin, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn back both, and also make them penetrate both from the inner to the outer, in the two extremities of the mirach as well, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is a suture that precedes the remembrance.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the treatise of Galen also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some have said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The stitching of the wound is reinforced with two hooks.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, so that you introduce into them a single thread: and begin with the introduction of the hook, from what is at hand, and make it penetrate up to the other side, according to the stitching of those who sew equal leathers.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is a disruption in the middle of the belly, then its stitching is more difficult than that of other places of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the medicine for wounds is the judgment of the remaining wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you treat a fresh wound with its own blood, before it changes into air: and you reduce the inflammation, and soothe it, and adapt it: then put on a powder of incarnate.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already changed the wound: then put on it some ointments which are present to you, until they make pus: and the threads fall out, and the skin is consoled, and marvel.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as it is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If you do not have the medicines present, then put on it immediately, from which it begins to discharge pus, an old compress: and change it twice a day, as I instructed you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medications in many arrangements, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if the wound communicates with the principal members in the lesion, then it is necessary to dip a soft wool in oil of tempered warmth, or in rose oil: and put it around the circumference of the places that are between the groin, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If it feels pain, or pruritus, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens) then give it an enema with astringent wine, black, and warm: especially if the putrefaction has already penetrated into the intestine, and a penetrating flux has been made up to the concavity of it.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you should know that what is from a thick intestine is of easier healing, and what is from those is from a subtle one, of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine, however, which is called "fasting", does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from veins, and the greatness of those, and because of the subtlety of its body, and proximity to the natural nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, what proceeds from the wound is pus, and you follow it freshly: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, indeed, a space has opened up to it, and it has already become green or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with a thread above the place which has been denigrated by it, so that there does not occur a flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in pus there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two hanging ends of a thread from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that there may be alleviated above you the attraction of it, and the extraction of it in case of pus, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A reminder of the wound that occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When disruption occurs in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it can be restored in certain men: for I have seen someone who was wounded in his belly with a thrust of a lance, and there was a wound on the right side of the stomach, and an old wound: and it became a fistula, and excrement came out from it, and windiness.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I therefore applied treatment, until I was not confident in its healing: nor did I cease to handle it subtly, until it was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place was already consolidated, I feared for the weak man, that a bad thing would happen to him in his belly: and it did not happen to him from that bad occurrence.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in his better arrangements, eating and drinking, and being bathed, and having taken a warm bath, and exercising in his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is necessary to bind it up according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, as you receive the forms of large headed wounds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and put one formica (ant) from those that have their mouth open on top of the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it thus takes hold upon them, and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then put another formica near the first, and do not cease to make that with a formica after a formica according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and sew up the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is nourished, and healed, and does not receive a chronic painful harm.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible to bind the intestine also with a subtle thread: which has been cleansed from the intestine of an animal, and attached to it after being introduced into the wound.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, as you receive the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and much is extracted.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then bind on its extremity a subtle flaxen thread wrapped around.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the wound, and sew up the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it to a scar.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is not but according to the way of confidence and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that a wound which is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines: then there is no ingenuity unless subtle treatment, nor is its healing complete.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	On the treatment of hernias and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound or aposteme, when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and always discharges pus, and is not separated: then it is universally called a fistula in whatever member it may be; and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And indeed a fistula is a hardened, white, filtered nodulation, without pain, which is surrounded by the wing of a bird; and because of this some people call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is sometimes moist, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is separated at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes it is scanty; and it is thick, and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already stated in the division, then when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor is flesh born in it, is not that except on account of one of the nine new causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of which is either because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or its malignity; or because there is hard flesh between it and its lips, preventing the growth of new flesh; or because it is full of much filth and corruption; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the material that is applied to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is inconvenient for its cure; or because a pestilential decay falls upon the region, or through the properties of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta; where digestion of diseases is difficult, and healing of apostemes is slow by nature; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and signs of them, and their treatments with medicines in the division; and it is fitting here that I make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuchemen, which is done by surgical operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You should know that a fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or skin; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs; or to some of the dorsal vertebrae, or to some of the composite joints; such as the hand and foot: and there are those that approach the proximity of a principal member and its similars.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Those therefore among these fistulas which are of this kind, are from chronic diseases that are difficult to heal, and do not receive treatment, and their occupation with them is laborious and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from fistulas that some of whose profundity does not reach to these places which I mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and wish to penetrate to the knowledge of it, then take a probe made of copper or iron, if the fistula tends according to straightness, and probe it with the same.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a leaden probe of subtle quality.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, with the softness of its body, is bent and curved around the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to investigate it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, cleanse one of its openings from its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture that you cleanse it with, flows towards other openings, and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then, inquire carefully according to what method is possible for you: so that you may know what is there, whether it is a bone, or a nerve, and whether the fistula is concave and remote, or near; or whether it is one fistula with many openings, and stands over the whole of it, with the greatest strength of yours; with your questioning, in which you question the weak, and with the invention of pain at compression with your hand on the place, and similar signs and causes of accidental accidents.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you stand over all those true stations, then proceed to the secondary cure with confidence; and it is thus, as you consider at that time, if there is a nearby fistula appearing, or in a healthy place far from the joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places that I will tell you: then cut the fistula according to what has been described in my narrative, and remove what is in it through filtration, and corrupted flesh, which is born in its opening from the flesh, or pus, and similar things; and cure it, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If the fistula is of great depth and is according to the straightness; then it is necessary that you cut it as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer wrapped licinia in acute medicines; and introduce it until you reach the concavity of the fistula that you comprehended with the iron: do this several times, until the acute medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal through that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If the cause of the fistula is a bone, and it is certified by you in that place: then investigate it, and cut it according to what I have narrated to you: if nothing prohibits you from the vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If a bone is detected by you and it has something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until the entire corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which incarnates it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	What if it does not heal, and emits pus as it was doing before: then know that you did not achieve total eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	So examine it thoroughly at that second point, and make a precise judgment about it, and cleanse it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it becomes healthy, that is good; and if not, then you will know that the corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	There is no ingenuity for you in this, unless you leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, extract it with subtle forceps that are suitable for that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then make a precise extraction of all of them, and do not leave anything behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If indeed something is opposed to you from the moistures, and there is no fear of incision among them, or error: then cut into those moistures and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed you do not have the preparation to remove the bones at that hour, then place on the wound what will rot it: and leave it, until it rots what is around those bones from the flesh and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And keep watch over the wound so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the section be constricted which you have cut out in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Put on it, if you can, a burnt copper with triturated sulfur and oil: or a burnt copper in Egyptian ointment, or some other green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures rot, and the bones are separated from them, the evacuation of them is alleviated, and their extraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If there is one large bone, such as the thigh bone or hip bone, and similar to those, and what is corrupted from it is a great part: then scrape it with a final rasping, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If indeed what is in it is greatly corrupted, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it all the way up to the place where the corruption reaches; then treat it until it becomes consolidated.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I relate to you a case that happened to a man with his own wound, so that you may put it as an example and aid to your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of around thirty years old, who had pain in his thigh, caused by a moving thing inside his body, that is, from the interior, until the materials reached the thigh, and it became an abscess with a large swelling: and there was no external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	It was extended therefore over time with his error of doctors, until the abscess opened, and many materials gathered with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was postponed, until the thigh became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus and bodily discharges.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Many doctors treated him for almost two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of healing, until I was called, and I saw his thigh, and the materials that were flowing out of those openings in a great stream: also, the whole body of the man was already weakened, and its color was citrine.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I then introduced a probe into one of the openings, and it reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I thoroughly examined all the openings: and I found that they were coming from a single source, extending from all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I proceeded therefore, and I cut around one of those openings, until I laid bare a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already decayed, and blackened, and rotten, and perforated, so that it had penetrated all the way to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore remove what is apparent to me and prepared from a rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I put aside what was not in the bone except that corruption which I cut away, and I removed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And now I have eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied a restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines over a long period of time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed and examined above the bone a second time above the first detection, and I found a continuous corruption with the bone; and I removed what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I therefore examined it again, and did not cease to cut into the bone in parts, and to try to restore it: and it was not restored, until I cut out about a handful from the bone, and extracted that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and this repetition would not have been necessary in the operation, and section of it, except for the weakness and frailty of the patient, and the scarcity of his tolerance, and my fear for him of death: because there was a constant risk to him at all times from the abundance of bad evacuations.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore completely healed: and flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he was restored to his own dispositions: and it did not cause him any harmful opposition in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the prominent bone in the body is already broken, then it is necessary to saw it, according to this method: and it is done thus: that you take a ligament, and tie it around the extremity of the prominent bone: and order someone, who stretches it upwards: and put another ligament made of thick wool on top of the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it on the flesh that is above the bone; and stretch out the limb, so that you draw the flesh towards the lower parts. And you shall touch the flesh over the place where you wish to make an incision, so that the incision does not harm the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a splint or board beneath the bone below; because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting through the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the incision be above the corrupted place for a short time, so that there is no concavity of the bone's corruption; and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and it is forced to make an incision in another place.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and does not protrude, but rather continues with its part; and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in that very part: then remove the flesh from all parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place a splint below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Next, make an incision from the first part where the corruption is, until the incision continues from the other part; and let the incision be according to the length, a little away from the corruption, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut through the corrupted joint, and make an incision into the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no ingenuity in it except scraping away.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If indeed the corruption is in the web of the hand or in the web of the foot, then the matter is very difficult indeed.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is truly necessary that you investigate the corruption as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it away, and cleanse it according to whatever disposition is possible for you, and with whatever ingenuity you may rectify it for yourself; when it does not cause a contradiction in the Vein or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that the incisions and sawings to be made on these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety, and size, and smallness, and hardness, and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for every species of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you the type of instrument which you need, when there is a prolonged study with you.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is a testament to the methods of healing: for then you will already have discovered through yourself that which is suitable for every infirmity from the instruments.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am setting out for you at the end of this chapter a list of instruments, which you will set as examples on those which you cut, and a test by which you experience others.
Forma Serrae.	The form of a saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of a different saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of another kind of saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of a saw is depicted, it should be made with precision.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper curve be made, sharpened from iron: and let its handle be of boxwood, and let it be made in a precise pyramidal shape.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of a razor for suturing.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be according to the form of a star-shaped key: and let its points be according to the form of Elisch's lancets.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless the heads of the suturing instruments are rubbed against it when they become rusty, or the opening is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of a larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of a medium-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of a broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of a razor in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of another subtle razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of a razor with a curved extremity.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of a small razor, subtly held.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of a razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The form also of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a file, and it is an instrument like a saw; it is demonstrated in many places for the division of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of a rasp which is suitable for scraping what is perforated through the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremity is triangular, and it is pointed at the extremities.
Fit ex Indi.	It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly it is necessary that all things which we have mentioned should be made from rasps, and incisors, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures and it does not respond to treatment: and you see the corruption spreading into the limb, which does not yield to anything: then it is necessary to cut off that limb up to where the corruption reaches, so that the patient may be freed from death or from the evil which is a greater defect of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of this is that the limb becomes blackened, until it becomes putrid: as if fire had consumed it, or it had rotted after becoming black; until the putrefaction is cut away up to where the healthy part of the limb follows, and spreads into the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore it is proper to make an incision of it, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous animals: such as the sea scorpion, and the viper, and the rattlesnake, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption or sting is in a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption to spread into the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the forearm, and do not leave space for the corruption to spread until it reaches the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it has penetrated there, then cut the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption has passed and you see it around the elbow: then in that case it is a mortal illness.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that from the treatment, is a quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when corruption has penetrated into a toe, then cut it off at one of its joints: and if it has reached the arch of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it has ascended to the knee, then cut off the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	What if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no ingenuity in it, unless abandonment and leaving the sick person to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting a limb, or sawing it off, is to tighten a ligature below, which you want to cut: and tighten another ligature above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And the assistant tightens one ligature below: and the assistant tightens another ligature above upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until the entire flesh is uncovered.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it should be cut, or sawed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to put a linen cloth on all parts, and not touch the saw to a healthy place: and there may be additional harm to the sick person, and a warm aposteme.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however there is a flow of blood internally while you operate, then cauterize the place quickly: or put some powder that stops the bleeding on it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medication, until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligature, and care for it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to the man with his foot, this same thing happening that I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What happens is that a blackening occurs on his foot, with a burning sensation similar to fire combustion; and that corruption first occurs on the toe, until it infects the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore, a man was preserved from his gangrene, after he saw the corruption falling upon his limb with its fury, which he found from the pain and burning sensation; and it happened to him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed for him, that same corruption happened to him again on the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I attempted to remove that excess with what I applied to his hand from medicines after cleansing his body: and the excess did not recede, but began to spread to another finger; until the corruption began on his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called upon me to cut into his hand; and I did not want that, hoping for a recoil from the excess; and I also feared death itself at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's strength was above the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he despaired of me, he returned to his own land; and he came back to me about it, because he was preserved, and his entire hand was cut open; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not add this narrative, unless it be an aid for that which falls from the kind of this disease; and to be a signification by which it may be signified, and according to what may be done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Of the treatment of sinews, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged, until it makes a collection of sanious matter: then it bursts or perforates, and what is in it exits through the sanious matter, and a vacant place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is above it is like a pannus that has already been emptied: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, nor does it impress on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be named Sinus: and it is not named Fistula: but if its space is prolonged until the corruption impresses on one of these members, then it is named Fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is to cut the entire skin as it rotates, especially when it has become thin and is made like a piece of cloth, and you should be confident because it does not adhere to the place due to its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you think that the skin adheres and does not follow from the last corruption, and if there is thickness on the skin from the flesh, then treat it with a clyster, and it is as if you should consider it according to the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine, which is made of vinegar, oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, mixed together in a vessel: and they are decocted over fire until the medicine is red-hot: and it is applied to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the sinus with it: and close its orifice, and administer the medicine to it for a quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression: do that for several days, until the sinus is cleansed and the foul smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when you clysterize with water of ashes, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is, as if you take the ash of vitis wood or the ash of ilex wood: and you cast it upon the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the sinus has now been cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	What if the patient is not tolerant of the Egyptian medicine, nor of the water of ashes, then clysterize it with water and honey, to which something from crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clysterize it with honey and wine mixed together, since it is a property of honey to cleanse and purify: and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an abundance of stickiness and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done that several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is now removed: then inject it with what makes flesh grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you should take from the plaster of dyafinion: and dissolve it with rose oil and wine of stipticon; or inject it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	What if the orifice of the sinus is constricted, where the cannula of the injection cannot enter: then enlarge it with an iron instrument for a short time: or put in it a wrapped-on license in Egyptian ointment, or in royal ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly, if the orifice is also wide, then bring its lips together with a suture: and allow from it a quantity in which it can be injected without excess.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly, if the orifice from which pus flows is elevated to the higher areas: then dry it in a depressed place that is in it, so that the pus may flow out of it downwards: for when pus is confined in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	What if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus around its lower part according to your intention: then try, that you prepare the limb by a preparation through which the pus may flow out with ease, according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try, that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take consolidating medicines which are applied to the wound, suitable for what you intend.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them out on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a quantity that it makes contact with the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps directly into the orifice of the sinus, making the opening of the sinus a little wider.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread from gentle ointments onto another cloth, according to the size of the opening: and place it over the position farthest from the orifice of the sinus, so that the flow of pus from it is alleviated: and do not remove the large cloth, unless after several days, one time.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	That one who is above the orifice of the abscess, is the one who removes it at every hour, so that what accumulates in it from pus may come out; and so you know whether what flows out from it is a lot, or a little: or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you repeat this, consider the location of the abscess itself, whether the master of its pain is felt in it, or if there is no pain in it, and whether there is an aposteme in it, or if there is no aposteme in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your medication is extended thus, and you see the matter that comes out above the orifice of the abscess, then you know that the abscess has already adhered, or is approximating to adherence: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the ulcer, then change the dressing with another, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If however a subtle virus comes out of the abscess after a long time, then do not despair about its adherence, for its healing is approaching, since there are people who slow down the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If however there comes out from the abscess after many days undigested pus, then you know that the abscess has not adhered.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adherence of the abscess is delayed, and its resolution is prolonged: then add to the desiccation of medicines, what true doctors do, so that the medicines may be in their humid substance and in their dry virtue: such as the dyaphenic ointment, when it is added to it with an excessive addition from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last utmost remedy by which it is cured, is to receive the dyaphenic ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and return it to the old equal wine in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now it does similarly to this action, when you do not have the present ointment of dyafinicon, honey, when you dissolve it, then it is absorbed, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and galbanum: grind all of it, and pulverize that over the honey while it is over the flame.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then apply a layer over the honey, and spread it over the wound: and apply with honey what you have dissolved, until it is absorbed: and sprinkle the powder over it, and put it on the bandage, and tie it up.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when it is administered in that aristolochia longa, and roots of celestial lily, and it is lily: and flour of herb, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them in simple forms, or combined, grind them, and sieve them: and pulverize over the honey what you have narrated, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	What if the wound is prolonged and not healed by this treatment: then know that there is deep-seated corruption: or now it makes an impression on the bones, or in the remaining hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the fistula cure, according to what has been previously mentioned.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the treatment of panaritium and worn away nails, and incision of added finger, and cutting.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritium is a type of abscess that grows under the nail of the thumb or foot, and perhaps it grows on the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore the matter of it is prolonged, and its treatment is neglected, and it becomes abscessed with a hot aposteme: or it becomes corrupted, and discharges pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the bone, until it has a foul smell: and the extremity of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary to cut away the entire surplus that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the ulcer after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cauterization is a very helpful remedy.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the excess flesh of the nail is now compressing the inner flesh, and begins to sting it, and hurts it: then it is necessary to place a subtle file under the angle of the nail that stings the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut away the flesh with ease, and apply what remains of the flesh from burning remedies, corrosives, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	But if the corruption has already spread to the bone, then it is necessary to cut away that bone, and extract it: for it will never be healed as long as the corrupted bone remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption advancing on the finger, then cut it off at one of the nodes, according to what has been previously mentioned about its removal.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	But if nail abrasion or contusion occurs: and there is severe pain in it, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut away the nail with a sharp Spatula-like instrument, making a transverse section from top to bottom.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful, lest the section reaches the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the patient, and it will be a cause of inflammation and suppuration at the site.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with what soothes the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	But an added finger that grows on some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail on it: and some of them grow from the root joint, or their growth is in certain nodes of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, one who is born with certain nodes on their fingers does not move; and one who is born at the joint of a finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, one who is fleshy from those is easy to section.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Because it is, as you cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But one whose growth is in the root of the joint, cure is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Desist therefore from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one who is born on the finger at the last node, then it is necessary to cut into the flesh first with a rounded incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw into the bone with one of those suitable saws for that purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then cure it, until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	But the consolidation that occurs in the fingers is often due to the natural disposition of man, that is, being born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is necessary therefore to dissect that consolidation, until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then put between them a linen bandage, or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not consolidate too quickly, and separate them: or put between them a thin lead plate, until the place is consolidated as needed.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if a consolidation occurs in certain fingers with the palm, then dissect that consolidation, according to how it is prepared and suits the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Concerning the Incision of Veins.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins are twisted, thick, full of superfluous melancholic humor which occurs in many parts of the body; and their most frequent occurrence is in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and labor, and carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to administer a strong purging of the body with black bile several times with forceful evacuation.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then, a bloodletting from the patient's arm into the basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of the ears with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	Their vein is, so that they may be cut, and black blood is extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another method is, to evacuate the vein, and to extract completely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The incision of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	One should soak the leg first with much warm water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the weak leg from the upper part of its hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then, cut the vein at one place, or two, or three, in a broad section.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then evacuate, that is, extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg, up to above, and it is necessary to bleed the weak patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail with a vein up to below: until there issues from the blood as much as you see is sufficient, and as much as the strength of the weak patient can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it: and instruct him to abstain from foods generating black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and that harms the weak patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The evacuation of it is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the weak leg, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then put it in a bath: or soak it in its leg with warm water, until it becomes red and the veins overflow: or exercise it with strong exercise, if there is no bath present, until the member becomes hot.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin directly along the vein's length: or at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and remove the vein from every part, until it appears to the senses: and it is upon its appearance that you see it turning from redness to blackness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it emerges from the skin, you see it white as if it were a tendon.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce beneath it a rod, until when it is elevated and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut a section close to that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then remove the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then elevate it with rods as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section, or more sections, if it is necessary for that.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate, and make an incision at the last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract it to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that, until you extract it from the section that is superior, or all the other sections, until when it emerges whole: then incise it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If however it does not obey you to extract and elevate: then introduce a strong double thread, and tie it, and extract it: or introduce beneath it a rod; and turn your hand to every part, until it emerges.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it be incised.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is incised, it will be difficult for you to elevate it strongly, and it will become inflamed above the weak part from that harm.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have extracted it whole: then put on the wound a compress soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil: and take care of it, until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	What if the vein is contracted, having a twisted condition where there is an involution to the parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary to find on it every part of its twisting, and the places of its involution.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then hang it with hooks, so that you elevate the entire thing; and beware at your operating site not to inflict a wound or lesions on yourself, for it will be difficult to raise it above you or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Be careful therefore and preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The shape of the wound is what heals the damage.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The shape of the hook is blind.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not curved like the other hooks, nor is it of acute extremity, so as not to wound; and it has a coarse flexibility, gentle: for if it were subtle, it would wound with its subtlety; rather it has a redundant coarseness, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the veins of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot and dry lands, such as those of Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in hot and dry lands with little tenderness, that is, in which neither herb nor tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation indeed is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as it happens within bodies of snakes and worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And a sign of the inception of this vein is that an inflammation occurs in the leg with intense heat.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is ulcerated.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from that ulcerated place, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary to apply a poultice of crushed lead, whose weight is one dirham and two nodules, and suspend the lead from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever something emerges from it to the outside, apply that to the lead, and nodulate it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	What if it is prolonged much, then cut off a part of it, and leave the rest untouched.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root before it has come out entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Because if you cut, it is constricted, and it grows into the flesh; and it causes an abscess to form, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Wherefore it is necessary to handle gently and extract gradually, until it comes out from its very end, and nothing of it remains in the body; and indeed this vein comes out in some men which is five palms long and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has reached me, because it has come out from a man who was twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If, however, it is cut during your hour of medication: then insert the scalpel into its opening, and perforate it with a long opening, along with the body, until everything that is in it is evacuated from the material; and administer putrefaction of the place with medicines for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat the apostema itself with a healing treatment.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And indeed this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Heal it therefore, as we have said in the division, and with what has been sent beforehand.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Concerning the cutting away of worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bouine disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is named Bouine disease in a certain land among us; because it often befalls oxen, and there is a small worm, which is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it wanders throughout the entire body, ascending and descending; and it is perceived by sensation during its movement from limb to limb, until it bursts forth wherever it bursts forth through the skin.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just like worms and serpents, that is, earthworms, and ascarids in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared on account of its evil nature.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it wanders in the body and rises to the head, and arrives at the location: then perhaps it appears in it, and emerges, and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure it, and extract it, then it does not happen unless through its movement, and the manifestation of its own sensation.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore, to bind what is above it, and what is below it with a strong constricting bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is deeply rooted in the flesh, and you do not find it: then place a cautery on the location with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater fear is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If you see that it has already arrived at the head near the eye, then bind underneath it a good tight bandage above the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary for the weak to use purification of their body, with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the section about the disease Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in certain members; then it moves from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I have indeed seen it myself, according to what I relate to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a weak woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And he stretched out his arm, and saw a small swelling in the vein of his arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after he remained for one hour, he saw a swelling increase with a warm poultice, as it increases like a worm, ascending to his shoulder more quickly than it could be; so that it might be like living silver, when it moves from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain then receded from that place, and was fixed in his shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then he sat for one hour, and it flowed into the rest of the body, until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that it had revolved throughout his whole body, according to what he saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed therefore at the swiftness of its transformation from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I, indeed, had not seen this disease before with my own eyes in such a manner according to this method.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	But I have seen many who find the pain changing from limb to limb: and I did not see it with my own eyes, as I saw it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it was anything else, except because the woman was one of those who are afflicted with dryness of the bodily veins, which are detected from the veins of the body; hence it appears to the sense that this changing windiness.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary, that they do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to your eye as we have said, then bind tightly above it, and below it quickly; and dry above it until the confined windiness goes out: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with exercise of the body, and with what expels windiness, and charm them away with foul-smelling pills, and pills made from serpentine, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the Extraction of Arrowheads.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 46.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrowheads are distinguished according to their own kinds and according to the places in which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is this: because among them there are those that have large points and small ones; and concave and straight.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them there are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them there are those that have flaps.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them there are those that have stars or star-shaped heads.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those, however, which are according to the limbs in which they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or indeed the limbs are from principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into one of these principal members, and death's signs appear to you, which I will narrate to you afterwards, then it is necessary that you hasten the extraction of that arrowhead from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrowhead is not hidden deep in the member, then extract it, and cure the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	From the signs of the brain when an arrowhead falls into it and penetrates to the bone, and there is a siphac that is above the brain, are: because there occur from it severe headaches, and darkness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood flows out from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And there flows out from the place of the wound a white humidity similar to pus.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there emerges from it something similar to the suppuration of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then desist from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the arrow when it falls on the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and one feels as if it were fixed in a hard substance, not in an empty space.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of a pulse; and black blood flows out from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And there follows that coldness of the extremities, and a chilly sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death is approaching without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the emission of frothy blood from the wound; and the veins that follow the neck become inflamed, and the color of the patient changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a great, high-pitched sigh; and he seeks to attract cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls on the diaphragm, which is in the chest; then it is near the small ribs; and there occurs a great anxiety with vehement pain, with sighing; and all the members of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls on the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food emerges from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls on the belly, and is fixed in it: there emerges from the wound something filthy, or faeces, or intestine which is already disrupted.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope in its cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls on the bladder, and urine emerges: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is more severe over the patient: then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blades, and arms, and dorsal vertebrae, and shoulders, and hips, and legs, and similar ones from the saving limbs are treated according to various conditions: when the arrow does not find an artery or nerve; and there is no poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I will tell you what I saw about this arrow wound, so that I may signify it to you through your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	What happened was that an arrow fell on the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore extracted it from the other side beneath the fat of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not reach it except for a small extremity of it, with which it adhered to its wooden shaft: and it was a large arrow from the Turkish bows, with smooth iron, on which there were no rusts.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabian arrow, and it is one that has rusts.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I therefore cut above it between two ligatures: and it had already become submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was therefore careful with it until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man who had been struck in his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed for him, and nothing had changed in his condition, I operated on the arrow: and I made an incision above it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no harm came to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man whose arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound had consolidated above it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman who had been struck by an arrow in her belly, and the wound had consolidated above it, and the arrow remained inside: and nothing had changed in her condition, and the woman did not experience any harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw a man who had an arrow fall on his face, and the wound was consolidated and remained there, not causing him much pain; and many similar things to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a prince of the King, which had fallen on him in the middle of his nose, and had already declined to the right side for a while; and the whole arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called therefore to his treatment after the accident of the arrow for up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found therefore a wound of the arrow strongly tightened.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I probed therefore with a subtle probe, and did not feel it; and he himself indeed felt a prickling sensation and pain under his right arm.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I suspected therefore that it was a point from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I applied a plaster to the place with an attracting and digestive plaster, confiding in myself that the place would apostemate and show me a sign of the arrow, so I could cut around it; and nothing happened in the affected place indicating that the arrow had not reached the spot.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I applied a plaster over it for many days; and nothing happened, and the wound was consolidated in the meantime; and he remained weak from the extraction of that space for several days, until he felt the arrow on a certain day within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I put therefore a sharp, corroding medicine on the wound for many days, until it was opened; and when I probed it with a probe, I felt the subtle tip of the arrow's end which was sticking to the bone.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly to us; and it took me around four months' time with him.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move them, and it did not obstruct the exit: then I did not cease to be clever and ingenious over it with various ingenious methods, until I took hold of it on a certain day with carefully made forceps, according to the form they would take at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And physicians certainly judge that a nose cartilage is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I restored it therefore, and the wound was consolidated, and the injured part was healed with complete integrity: nor did anything harm him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of extracting a certain arrow: so that you may put that rule and significance over what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood with narration: nor does this book comprehend it, and the prudent artisan compares a little with much: and with what is present, over what is absent: and he finds a new operation, and a new instrument, according to the descent into extraneous things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not come out from the limbs in which they are fixed, unless according to two methods.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place into which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or through the opposite part of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding into the fleshy place: and it is attracted, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	What if it does not obstruct the exit at the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it for some days, until the flesh that is around it putrefies: and its attraction is alleviated, and its egress.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in a bone, and does not obstruct the exit for you, then leave it also for some days: and try it with attraction and motion every day, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you at the outlet after a few days, then it is necessary to make perforations around the arrowhead in the bone itself from every side with a subtle drill, until the arrowheads are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the skull bone, and has already progressed into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those bad accidents which I mentioned appear: then abstain from attracting the arrow, and leave it, until it adjusts itself after a few days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sifac, then death will not be prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, but only in the body of the bone, and has not penetrated to the sifac: and he remains weak for several days, and none of those accidents happen to him: then use your ingenuity in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is deeply fixed and does not obey you at attraction: then administer the drill around the arrowhead, as I narrated to you: afterwards cure the place, until he is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow has already been concealed in the body and is hidden and concealed from sensation: then probe for it with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	But if you feel it, then attract it with certain instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you cannot get above it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein: then enlarge above it, until the wound is enlarged, and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	What if there are jagged edges which hold it fast, then free the fixed flesh from them on every side, with all the ingenuity you can, and use your skills, if it cannot be raised above the fracture of the auricles, and their contortion, until it is freed.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you, when you perform the extraction of an arrowhead, in whatever location it is, then use the contortion of your hand, with forceps, towards all parts, until you make it come out: and with utmost subtlety, so that the arrowhead does not break, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	What if you cannot get it out at that time, then leave it for some days, until the things that are around it putrefy.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try again: for if a flow of blood is caused by the contrariety to you, then administer what we have said about curation in its chapter: and preserve your virtue from incision of a vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer your ingenuity in every way possible to extract the arrowhead: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have narrated to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary, that when you pull out the arrowhead, it should be weakened according to its shape, according to what it was like at the time of the accident with the arrow.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If however it is not possible for you to do that, then administer what is possible for you according to the circumstances.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrowhead that emerges from the opposite part of the other side, or already proceeds to exteriorize something from it: or it makes a prominence on the extremity of the arrow through sensation from the upper part of the adjacent skin, and you see it standing out: therefore cut above it, and let the section be according to the quantity that the forceps can grasp in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it out: for it itself will be easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrowhead impresses itself into the bone, and becomes more firmly fixed: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave her for a few days; then return to her, until she begins to recover.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	What if the arrow's wood is in it, then push it out with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If the wood has fallen out, and you want to administer a push: then insert into her a concave instrument, so that it enters into the hollow of the arrow's tail; then push it out with that itself.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow is concave, then push it out with an instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is extracted through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	What if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary, to excavate the entire concave flesh, where the poison is; if that is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat her with what is suitable for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	What if the arrow is lodged in the breast, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side; and it is near what you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and be careful about the incision of the vein, or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew up the wound, if you see fit, and treat it, until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the method of forceps, with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	There are extremities similar to a bird's beak, which were made like scissors: when they grasp above the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And they are made from them in many species, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity of the arrow's magnitude, and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its constrictedness.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of a concave pusher.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of a straight pusher.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the form of a straight extremity like a rod, so that its entrance is extracted into the concave arrow, and it is pushed out with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This extremity of the pushing concavity is a concavity like a bird's wing, so that the entrance of the arrowhead may be directed into it and its impulse.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On the bloodletting of Veins.
Caput XCVII.	Head 47.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	Veins to be bloodletted, whose customary course is in the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Out of these, there are sixteen in the head: two pulsatile veins, which are behind the ears, called two Herbae; and two arteries, which are visible on both temples; and two veins that are in both tear ducts of the eyes, which are called Aspicientes; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the end of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Jugular veins, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins that are in the lower lip.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	On the phlebotomy of veins by Algeber.

Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Make the incision therefore on both sides with an oblique incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If however you are in doubt about them, and do not know which one is: then turn to the incision of the larger one, and make it more manifest.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	On the phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue, after the cephalic phlebotomy.

The phlebotomy of the two veins that are under the tongue is a remedy: because the cephalic phlebotomy is for the affections that are in the throat, and the weakness of the uvula, and the weaknesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Concerning the three veins at the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	There are three veins which are operated on in the elbow, and it is in these that the customary phlebotomy is performed on all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And the phlebotomy of those is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a broad, blunt phlebotomy instrument; or by oiling to achieve subtlety of inclination; or by cutting with a knife-shaped phlebotomy instrument, and it is Al-nesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Al-nesil is, which is suitable for the incision.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them there are broad and subtle species according to the amplitude of the veins and their constriction. The form of the phlebotomy instrument is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave, full, protruding, visible, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomy instrument is of lesser width, and more subtle at the extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for phlebotomy of subtle veins, which contain thin, clear blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the Basilica vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilica, however, which is one of those three veins of phlebotomy, is a help.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the diseased places which are beneath the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest and stomach; and it is suitable for the phlebotomist to perform phlebotomy with caution, lest there be fear of bleeding from the artery that lies beneath.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he has erred and added to the puncture of phlebotomy, he will cut into that artery and cause a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary not to perform phlebotomy with a pointed phlebotome; instead it should be cutting with Al-nesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	What if the basilic vein does not appear with a clear and manifest appearance, then it is necessary to transfer to another one, and to change to a different branch of it: or to use a phlebotome in place of the funis of the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is clear and should be cut with a phlebotome Al-nesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you want to perform phlebotomy on the same one, then it is necessary to constrict the arm beforehand, so that you touch the place until you recognize the site of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with a branding iron, afterwards constrict the arm, and cut the vein at an oblique section with a phlebotome Al-nesil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware lest the percussion falls through the space to the location of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you observe, as you constrict the ligament, an inflammation at the place which you marked with a branding iron, then that inflation is an arterial inflation: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	What if you see the blood at the phlebotomy jumping out, like the urine of a child, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from an arterial blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then press down, and put your finger on the space for a long time, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is stopped (for it is often stopped), then constrict the arm, and release it: and beware lest the weak one be moved by its motion: and let him be above his fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move him for some days, until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If however the bleeding does not stop, and it overcomes you: and there is no present remedy for you at that moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For the extremities are constricted, and the bleeding stops.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a fistula dressing, and bind it: take one half, and tie it above the place of the vein's constriction with a ligature and soft padding until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the bleeding stops, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with the treatment that preceded, remembering the place from which the powder of the bleeding stopped the flow of blood: and the stopping of its blood is not difficult in many circumstances, because of the small location of the wound, and the possibility of ligature from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On the Phlebotomy of the Dark Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The phlebotomy of the Dark Vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the superior part of the head and the inferior part of the body: therefore, since it is composed of the basilic branch and the cephalic branch, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it suits the phlebotomist to be above fear from his phlebotomy, for beneath it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, it happens that numbness occurs in it, and the healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it may not be fully healed.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If however it is hidden in certain men, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy where the phlebotomist makes an incision with Alnesil, and divides the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	Since if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the Veins of the Head.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The treatment of the Veins of the Head is phlebotomy, because it draws blood from the head and relieves the diseases of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary to perform phlebotomy properly on this vein, if you wish, by pricking with an olive-shaped phlebotome or a myrtle-shaped one: because it is the healthiest of all the veins, since there is no artery underneath, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is convenient for you to take care during phlebotomy, so that you should touch the head with the phlebotome only lightly, and seek a more tender spot: and it will not harm if you do not find it with the first strike, so that you may repeat it several times over the same spot.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps there may be a relapse in certain individuals when they are not phlebotomized on the first strike, but that relapse does not harm them in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of Phlebotomy and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of Phlebotomy, however, and its accidents arising from it, are things which you should consider in its proper performance.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, therefore, it is necessary that you know this: that phlebotomy should not be administered unless for the conservation of health, and its preservation, and caution against the onset of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that phlebotomy should be performed on one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Fusca, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of Spring, on an empty stomach, and in the spring season, and autumn, and winter after digestion, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let phlebotomy be performed on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Bloodletting that is administered to the sick does not have a predetermined hour; but when it provokes convenience and necessity at that time, whether at night, or during the day, and at every hour, and at every moment.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not suitable for bloodletting to be performed on children until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should pregnant women be bloodletted, unless from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should the elderly be bloodletted, who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When someone wants to be bloodletted for any reason whatsoever: it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines beforehand with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained feces in them; so that the veins do not attract noxious and putrid superfluities from the intestines during the bloodletting, which harm the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should the patient be full of toxins, that is, excessively nauseous; nor drunk, nor trembling from intoxication, until they are freed from these things.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor one who is weak with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And bloodletting should be avoided after a bout of colic passion, and vomiting, and flux of the stomach, and excessive coition, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and everything that dissolves the virtue from the bodily or animal corpus.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick from food and drinks, and medicines; if it is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him take a bath, if nothing prohibits it; or let him be exercised by some exercise, so that the blood is made more subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And let bloodletting be performed on him in the chest, around the third day, as we have said; and take care, so that his chest is freed from all bad animal accidents that day: such as anxiety, and anger, and fear; and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and superfluity, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And the surgeon should make present the things with which he is familiar through the use of aromatics, and perfumes, and trips to similar places, in accordance with the quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the phlebotomist should sit on a cushion, which should be higher than the cushion of the one being phlebotomized: afterwards he should extract his arm, and rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he should bind the ligament with a strap, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And the binding should be tempered, because when the binding is unequal, or excessive in the binding, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the binding, it is necessary to rub the hands of the one being phlebotomized simultaneously until the veins become swollen and declare themselves to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist should wipe away the phlebotomy with a little oil, in the ancient proper way.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his index finger of the left hand on the vein below the spot where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, gently: so that the vein does not flee and the percussion is felt.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because the vein is like a fleeing string during phlebotomy: and among them there is one that is full of windiness: and when you place the phlebotomy on it, it contracts beneath the phlebotomy, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is constricted: therefore it is necessary for this reason, that the phlebotomist be steady, and be solicitous in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should apply the phlebotomy instrument.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened with a single stroke, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then he should try another stroke in the same place gently, or above it with quickness: if the spot does not become inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	What if he faints, or the patient becomes weak, then let him rest for a day, or two days: and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed he has attracted a warm abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he take a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the bloodletting, if he loves it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	What if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly: and so that not too much quantity exits from the blood as desired: then repeat the phlebotomy at the same opening, according to correctness, and add a little to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do that with hastening, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place is, in many men, during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see that it has already become inflamed, then do not repeat it at all, for nothing excuses it in your regard.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put upon it something from the sediment of oil: because it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the sediment of oil in all your phlebotomies, where phlebotomists prohibit the flow of blood: and they make it a tyriacal preparation, and a sagzenic one, when it is put on the place from one of them.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is subtly thickened and resolved, when it is coarse.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	What if a great abscess occurs at the site of phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who is not experienced except on that occasion, or has a small opening of the vein, then apply and put upon the place a sponge infused in water and salt, warmed for a little while: and tighten it for one hour: because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary to do that after the blood has flowed out from that vein, with a supplement of itself, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If something black or greenish remains in the location after several days, it does not harm: and if you wish, apply to it some aloe solution, or myrrh, or something from the juice of mint, that is, calamen or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times indeed abscesses and swellings occur at the incision sites of bloodletting according to the method of Basil.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Put your hand therefore upon it, then if you find softness under the pressure of your hand upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Take heed therefore, so that you put on it something from what we have mentioned.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps a flow of blood from the artery may occur.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make an plaster for it with that in which there is sticking, so that the place may be bound together.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to extract from every man a certain quantity of blood according to the amount of his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the coloring of the wine on the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it flow out, until it becomes red: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it flow out, until it becomes subtle: and similarly if it is acute, until its acuteness is relieved.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs the extraction of blood twice, to amplify the phlebotomy of the veins, and let the phlebotomist be skilled: and in him who is weak, let it be contrary to that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract it in the veins, and that the opening be narrow: and what is better administered in phlebotomy of the veins is a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is healthy from the flow of blood, and from the incision of a nerve: and it is more praiseworthy and healthier than phlebotomy through width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to one who has become accustomed to bleeding through phlebotomy, it is necessary that they eat moderately sweet bread infused with pomegranate water: or if they are hot, let them take it out from the blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if they have a cold complexion, then let them take before phlebotomy bread infused with juice of mead, or with juice of honey aromatized with spices, or with aromatized and fragrant juice.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	What if it happens that they have a syncopic fit at the time of phlebotomy, and there is a cause for the abundant outflow of blood: then it is necessary to give them a drink of meat broth, and subtle fragrant syrup: and let them take aromatic things with galangal, and anoint their chest with it: and let them take the remaining things that we mentioned in the chapter on syncopic evacuations.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wants to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time: it is necessary for the one whose phlebotomy is due to abundant evacuation, and their strength is weak, to release the blood gradually according to the quantity of their strength on continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wants to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong: then let them do it after seven hours, or nine hours from their first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wants to attract blood from their body to the opposite part to which it inclines: it is necessary that they be evacuated on the second day, or the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whom there is much hot and inflamed blood in their body, and it becomes sharp, and causes fever: it is necessary that the blood exit from them in one vein, and a large quantity be extracted from them: and the opening be widened until a syncopic fit occurs: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and put your hand on their pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur in place of the syncopic fit.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For it often happens that, when the phlebotomist is ignorant and careless.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not suitable when one wants to release the arm, and release the blood a second time, since the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of the blood becomes difficult, so that it presses excessively upon it with vehemence, and the curvature extends rapidly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a great evil, or rather, to abandon it altogether, until it is phlebotomized a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove it with the acuteness of phlebotomy that which has coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and apply to it something salty dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And apply to it something from Tyriaca Alfaroch or Sagsena, and apply it with a gentle compression, until the blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the vein has become apostematous, then abandon it, and do not touch it, until the apostema settles.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	What if necessity provokes a second time to release the blood, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it at that place, or in another arm at another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The veins of the arm are phlebotomized at the place of the Fusea and Basilica, when they are not found, and are hidden, since they are composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of that phlebotomy is such that it introduces a weak hand into hot water, until the skin becomes red, and the veins appear manifestly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then bind over it with a ligature of moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then perform the second phlebotomy across the width gradually, not laterally, nor along the length; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize over the junction of the hand for a short time.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	What if the flow of blood is prohibited, then immerse the hand in hot water, and let the blood flow into the water, until you achieve your necessity.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If you are suffering from summer days, then you should avoid repeated hand washing in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the flow of blood is greatly increased by hot water at the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the bleeding of this vein is healthier for all veins, since there is no pulsating vessel under it, nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The bleeding of the Salvatella vein in the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this bleeding is such that you should bind the arm with a ligature or your hand, after you have inserted it into hot water, until the vein becomes inflamed and is strongly perceived by the sense.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then make an incision across the vein.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful, lest you ultimately injure your hand with the bleeding instrument.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For underneath are naked nerves of the fingers, stripped of their flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return your hand to hot water and allow the blood to flow from it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to hot water, the blood will clot at the mouth of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have extracted the necessary amount from the blood, then apply oil and salt to the vein: so that it may not close quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, it is necessary to do this with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The benefit of bleeding from the left hand is that it is helpful for spleen diseases; and do the same in this bleeding as you did in the second, equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of bleeding from the Saphena vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine diseases, and menstrual retention, and kidney weaknesses, and old ulcers of the hips and thighs, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of his phlebotomy is that he inserts his ailing foot into warm water and performs friction upon it until the veins swell; and he binds above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the place of the veins is at the heel, appearing opposite the thumb; and they branch out from it into many branches on the surface of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, he performs phlebotomy on its larger branch, or at the heel in its collection; because it is better and more healthy.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If he performs phlebotomy on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy where you perform phlebotomy across, as if you want to cut into it; and let the phlebotomist be skilled.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If the flow of blood is prohibited, then put his foot in warm water; and allow the blood to flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotomist has missed the vein at first attempt, then let him try again with phlebotomy at the upper parts, for the place is healthy and you do not fear evil from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the Saphenous vein of the other foot, equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The place of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel on the outer side of the anklebone.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of his phlebotomy is to alleviate pain in the ankle, when it is due to warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of his phlebotomy is that he enters the bath, and fasts; and binds his leg from the side of the ankle up to above the heel with four fingers, with a long thin thread: for it does not appear except on account of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When therefore it appears, then perform phlebotomy on it according to whatever method is possible for you, or according to the transverse technique; and it is better, either to cut into it with an incision, or to divide it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	The location of it is more saliva-like, and it is hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all: then make an incision on some branch of it, and it is the one that appears on the back of the foot, and near the ear; and be careful of the nerve, and make a flow of blood in the quantity that you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction, and put a crust over the place of the incision, and bind the area tightly.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It will heal quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning the ventosity, and the quality of its usage.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 48.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventoses are made from horns, and from copper, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And the ventosity is performed indeed according to two methods.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and bloodletting; and the other is ventosity without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventosity which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the ventoses that are administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the Ventosa of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and the ventoses of Alhagdahim, and they are two layers of the neck from both sides together; and the ventoses of the mind, and it is under the jawbone in the lower mouth; and the ventoses of the two spatulas; and the ventosa of Alachosos on the end of the tail; and the ventoses of the two fossae, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the ventoses of the two thighs; and the ventoses of the two hips.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed the ventosity does not draw out blood from you through the small scattered veins in the flesh, and because of that, no virtue comes out from them, just as it is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not expedient to apply a treatment with fire or without fire for any ailment that arises from overindulgence, until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity prompts to apply treatment through evacuation due to overindulgence or because of habit, we administer it at every hour, at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	Since there are men who when their blood increases, so they need to be relieved of it through evacuation, they find a heaviness in their head and dizziness.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And there are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And there are those who find itchiness on their face and forehead, and darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there are those who scratch the place of their evacuation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there are those whose flatulence increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And there are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth: or their tongue becomes ulcerated, and they spit out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there are those whose drowsiness increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And there are those who see in their sleep blood and redness, and wounds, and sores, and things that are similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something of those symptoms, and it is specifically during the third period of the month: we recommend that evacuation be done then, after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The indication for evacuation of the neck, however, is: because it contributes to heaviness in the head and what flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is expedient that it should be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed is instead of the phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted for one who has a cold complexion, or in whom there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that, it is not fitting for old people to use them, and in whom there are cold headaches.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever, however, uses it constantly, will generate upon himself an obstruction.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of that, it is fitting to advise the practitioner, to place his hand with a gentle puff downwards, fearing the generation of an obstruction.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosatio or Alkehel is the place of dark phlebotomy, and of royal phlebotomy, and because of that it brings about asthma, and constriction of the windpipe, and fissure of the windpipe instrument, and coughing, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is fitting to drive the Ventosa Alkehel gently, for if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosatio truly is alhagdahim, and it brings about sudden pains in the head, and blindness, and half-headaches, and perforations, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the place of royal phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is fitting to advise the practitioner, not to press his hand with a scarification: so that he may not cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventosatio under the chin, however, brings about ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar things from the diseases that are in the mouth: and it is in place of phlebotomy alieherich, which are in both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Ventosatio of the spatula shape brings about a condition called alchafacham, which comes from inflammation and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Ventosatio truly of the inner parts of the two hollows, brings about an aid to phlebotomy of the three veins, the Basilica, and the Fusca, and the Cephalica: because it itself attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and those small veins attract from other larger veins, until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary, that you should be cautious with the ventoser, lest it proceeds too much in the scarification; since the place is deprived of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The ventoser, however, which operates on the affected areas, helps hemorrhoids of the anus, and inferior ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary, that you should be cautious with the ventoser, so that it be a large ventoser, and so that it be made of copper: since the place needs strong suction, and perhaps the subtle ventoses would break; and a large scarification would be scarified.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The ventoses, however, diminish the crurium by a manifest diminution: since they attract blood from the whole body, and contribute to ancient pains in the kidneys, and bladder, and uterus: they provoke menstrua, and contribute to bothor, and ademenul; and they stand in place of phlebotomy of two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the treatment of the ventoses of the alhorcobeni is closely related to the treatment of the ventoses of two crura.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the ventoses is, that you should put the ventoser in a primary empty space, and apply tempered suction: and do not prolong the position of the ventoser, but rather place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that they attract the humors to the place equally: and do not cease to repeat it and continue, until you see the place now red and inflamed, and appears red with blood: then scarify, and apply suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those who have a tender flesh, with rare pores, it is necessary to scarify them only once, not more: so that the place does not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And advise the ventoser, to amplify the scarification, and to make it profound a little: and to temper the suction in facilitation, and quickness, and its own motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	What if there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, at first, the way is opened by subtlety of blood refinement, and its clarification; and in the second, by precise scrutiny of exact blood extraction of thickness.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is very feculent, then a third scarification should be made: so that the ultimate consequence may follow.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we want to extract blood little by little, or for a short time, one scarification is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	What if we want to extract much blood, we make multiple scarifications with many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure it, that the blood is thick: then it is necessary to make a deep scarification; and the equal term in scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which should be administered from enemas in the position of Ventura's, and what caution should be observed by him who administers the enema.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that person whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and their pores are constricted, it is necessary to anoint the places of Ventura's with open, gentle, resolving oils: if it is in the summer season, such as oil of alkeiri, or violet oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from cucumber seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the winter season, then narcissus oil, or oil from lily, or chamomile oil, or sarbatinum: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the excess is thick and cold: then the oil should be bitter, or from balsamite, or almond oil, or anetine oil: and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the enema administrator has large pores and tender flesh: then it is necessary to prohibit the use of oil, and it is necessary for them to wash those places of Ventura's after administration with rose water, or cold water, or solatri water, or cucumber water, or portulaca water: and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	That person whose blood is of much humidity, washes with vinegar and water of myrtle, and sumac; and similarly to them.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Those whose excesses are thick, wash with their vinegar and old wine, or with water of samsuc, or with a decoction of anet, or of camomille; and to them similarly.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is fitting that a fomentation be made in the bath, or in the heat of the bath, namely it is fitting that it be administered after coming out of the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not fitting that someone sleeps after a fomentation.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that requires to be regulated, either the one about to receive a fomentation or the one about to be phlebotomized before a fomentation.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that it is fitting to consider first: then if the one about to receive a fomentation or phlebotomy is choleric, and they overcome their blood with acute and inflammatory (humors), then it is fitting to take cooling remedies, such as granulated muzum; and also endivia with vinegar and lactuca, and secaniabin, and iuleb: and similarly to them.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put his food as soft-boiled eggs, and old ox meat, and seasoned dishes with herbs: and similarly to them.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose temperament is cold, it is fitting to take in drink a syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsacanabin made from seeds: and take medium wine that is fragrant, which is between old and new: and let him be advised, so that he uses moderation in food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put his food as soft-boiled eggs, and cane berries; and sparrows, that is, small birds: and soft-boiled doves should be added.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is fitting that the drink of the day of fomentation and phlebotomy be more than food: and it is fitting that there be given in drink to certain people at Tyriac hours alfaroch, or medicine from musk, that is, muscat, or alesselithe before fomentation; and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members may be comforted, and the blood may be subtly refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not suitable that they take it in a warm potion.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	About wounds without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Wounds that are without scarification are those that are located on the brain, and spleen, and lung, and on the navel, and umbilicus, and kidneys, and thigh; because these members do not undergo scarification upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And there is no inquiry through them, unless an attraction occurs from a bloody member to a member: as we put a wound on the breasts in a flux of menstrual blood.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we treat them, so that we dissolve the cold, frozen ventosity from the member: as we put a wound on the navel and umbilicus.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes the pain on that account, because it resolves that ventosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	And it is also applied to the kidneys, when there occurs in them a stagnation or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For the power of its attraction perhaps reveals the stagnation, or eradicates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it does similarly when it is applied to the brain and spleen, for eliminating ventosity in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these wounds are treated with evacuations, simply with incision alone.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are treated with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are treated with full warm water in inflammatory swellings: and that is, so that the wound may be filled, and it be large, with hot water alone, or with water in which herbs that are suitable have been decocted.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of wounds treated with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	The width of its orifice should be two fingers open, according to the form we have made: and its quantity in depth should be half a palm: and it should be on its side, in the place which is around its middle, a small hole, according to the quantity that the needle can enter: let it be made from copper simultaneously, or from tin, with thick, smooth, equal, polished edges: so that it does not harm the member at its position upon it: and let there be in its middle a transverse rod of copper, or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this large wound becomes great, greater than we described, and a little less than that, according to the weakness and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For there are wounds for boys and thin people that are different from those of men and stout-bodied individuals.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this wound with fire above the membrane is such that you should bring a linen cloth with fire from a candle or a small lamp made of wax: and place it above the middle of the transverse vein which is in the middle of the wound: so that the fire may be kindled around the lower part of the wound, so as not to burn the infirm body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it should be placed above the membrane: and a finger should be placed over the opening that I mentioned, until when we hold the wound: while we are in need, we lift the finger, and vapor exits through that opening, and the wound is immediately resolved.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then a linen cloth with fire according to its own method, and repeat it, if you need that.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in a wound that is treated with an empyema of the lungs with water, there is no transverse vein, nor opening: and it is not treated unless it is filled with water, and placed above the membrane only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this wound, because it is larger, can hold a lot of water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Of the suspension of blood-letting instruments.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-letting instruments are not administered in many cases, unless in those members where it is not possible to apply cupping glasses, due to their smallness, such as the lip, and gums, and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a member deprived of flesh, such as a finger, and nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you should choose blood-letting instruments that are in calm and sweet waters, clean from putridity.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are left for a day and night in sweet water, until they are soft, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is cleansed at first with bloodletting, and with cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the weak member is scrubbed, until it becomes red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Thereafter they are applied above it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they are filled, and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with a cupping glass, then it is almost the last resort in healing: and if not, then clean the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and it is rubbed, and pressed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	What if the flow of blood is prolonged after the fall of the blood-sucker, and it is that which is being poured out: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and put it above, until the pouring out ceases.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if the blood is multiplied, then powder above it with powdered ze'eg or galas, and similar things from stimptics: until the blood ceases.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they are applied above the place of half-crushed beans that have been deprived of their outer skin: and they are left, until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood ceases.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary, if iteration of the blood-sucker is necessary, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If, however, the blood-suckers are prohibited from suspension, then the place is cleansed with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or a fig is applied to the places, until something goes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are applied, for they themselves, when they feel something from the blood, adhere at once.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore they are about to fall, powder above them something from triturated aloe, or salt, or ashes: and they fall at once.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A general discourse on restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons, that they boast of this chapter, stupid medics and the common crowd, who have never examined an ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it happens that this method is banished from the science of our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I did not find anything good in it at all, and I did not acquire from it what I acquired, except through the length of reading ancient books and study surpassing their intellect, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I added experimentation and lengthy study to my way of life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from that, in this Chapter, all that contains my science: and on what has preceded my experiment, after I abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of prolongation, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and showed it at the end of declension: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, with the addition of declension, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	¶ Summaries and collections from the existence of fractures of bones, from those whose preliminary permission is necessary, before we begin the remembrance of fractured members and diverse ones, if each individually.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is fitting, as we say in the prologue of this Chapter, that summaries and chapters be directed to those whose intellect is moved first by the craftsman to establish themselves upon their truth: namely so that you, and those who are prompt, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or accident occurs, then it is necessary to bleed him in the first instance, and to release it, or both at the same time: if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of virtue; or he is one who has suffered something from those illnesses, or an old decrepit man; or it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his usual food, cool drinks, and lean meats, and avoid wine, and fatty meats, and fill himself with foods that do not replenish the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when he is secure from the inflammatory heat, and there is no effusion of matter to a limb: then the invalid returns to his first regimen with which his custom had accustomed him.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore the fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the invalid be fed with nutritious foods of much nourishment, thick, heavy, in which there is viscosity: such as food made from toasted bread with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and innards of cattle, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the consolidation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that fractured bones, when they are in people who are in early old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be continued and consolidated according to their natural order forever, because of the dryness of their members: and they are consolidated and continued which are from them in a state of gentle weakness, such as the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature adds to the fractured bone from every part something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds, until they are glued together, and bound together, until it comes to a state of strength and firmness, as it was at first, so that nothing prevents it from its operations: and for this reason it is necessary to put nourishing food on the invalid's diet, in which there are heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that fracture species are diverse, according to the diversity of members; since a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly all remaining members exist with diverse connections; and I will come with remembrance of all fracture species exposed in their distinct chapter.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of fractures of bones are also differentiated within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because a fracture of that kind is curved, besides which stars appear in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when a fracture of that kind occurs along the length of the bone; and there are fractures of that kind, namely, stars (or radiating lines), and additions proceeding, just as they are in a reed, when it is fitted with a stylus for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding; and it is a fracture with wound and disruption in the head; and it is a fracture of a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And for every species there is a genius or proper instrument in its restoration, according to what will come to remember it, distinctly in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that which is known about the fracture of the bone, there is its twistedness, and its own prominence; and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent twistedness in the place, nor sound upon your touch when you strike the bone with agitation, nor does the weak one feel great pain; then there is no fracture there, or it is possible that there is a twistedness or small fissure; not therefore is it necessary to move it with hand and compression altogether, but rather put upon it from medicines, whose remembrance comes after the moment that suits the place: afterwards, a subtle binding should be applied.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that the place when it is curved and divided into two, besides which stars appear in it, truly every part removes from its comparison: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to rectify it, making it equal before a hot aposteme happens to it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If, however, a warm aposteme occurs, then leave it alone for several days until the aposteme quiets down.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then treat it equally in whichever way it can be treated with gentle care and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and equalization are easier than those of bones, in which splints are applied.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what you have experienced as a reminder of its condition.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are splints on the bone, then extension of this fractured limb from two parts is necessary, whether it be hand or foot: or with your hand if it be a small limb: or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your positioning be such that you place the limb on a level surface, according to its natural shape, until the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then try, with all ingenuity, to restore those additions in their proper places: and beware, according to your strength, lest pain or injury occur to the weakened part through your operation: and try, according to your strength, to apply one bone to its fellow, according to the better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time to touch and feel it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and adjust it according to the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of violent extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often cause a warm aposteme to occur through their operation, or a contraction in the limb: as we have already seen that happen many times through their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect after equalization, and perform a decent operation, and structuring of that limb, and quiet, and tranquility: and warn the weakened part about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it cautious, lest it move during its hours of watchfulness, and its own sleep, and its revolution, and its agitation, and its evacuation, and all its movements with its ultimate strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And beware lest the positioning of the limb be with a positioning that follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Because it is so, since when he feels pain in the positioning of the limb or a lesion; then it is necessary to change it to another positioning that does not cause pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And beware with that, so its positioning is equal and straight: lest there occur twistedness in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture of the broken limb is, according to what I describe.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that fractured limbs are differentiated in their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Those therefore that are small from them, such as the arm, and finger, and neck, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be an enveloping of a soft, fine cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those however that are large from them, such as the hip, and leg, it is necessary that there be an enveloping of a broad, hard one.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad bandage connects the large limb, and tightens it from every part with an equal strictness, so that it does not admit any swelling.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin to put after your evacuation a suitable linen bandage on the soft cushion above the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to envelop the bandage over the place of the fracture itself with three or four envelopings, according to what the limb deserves: and tighten your hand a little while with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the upper part above the place of the fracture, and tighten less than was your previous strictness, by which you tightened the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then extend yourself with the enveloping from the place of the fracture a little, and gradually soften the strictness, until you grasp the great thing from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another cloth, and envelop it again over the fractured place with envelopings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards, you should proceed with an incision to the lower part of the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightening of the incision and its softening, according to what we have said concerning the first upper incision.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the incisions a piece of clean cloth or a linen pad, with which the twistedness of the fracture is eased, if there is twistedness in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then incise above the same vein another.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards, apply equal pressure on these incisions with applied stars, if there is no inflammation at the site, nor hot aposteme.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is inflammation or an aposteme, then apply to it what soothes that aposteme and reduces the inflammation; and leave it for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind above it with applied stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the Stars be from middle-sized, broad, smooth, and skillfully formed canes; or let them be from wood where cribra are made, which are made from pine, or cedar, that is, palm branches, or reeds; and let the width of all Stars be according to this form and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	Truly, it is necessary that the Star which is applied above the tracture be somewhat thicker and broader than the other Stars; and the length of the Star should be according to what is permitted by the member from its size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind above the Stars with another vein, according to the first strictura of the same kind.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie above with threads in the middle, according to what we have said about the strictura; and it is, that your strictura should be above the place of the fracture more; and as much as the fracture is more elongated, the strictura is smaller.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the middle threads be in moderate thickness and fineness, and let them be from soft flax.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Since the threads are thick, as is seen from the operation of stupid surgeons who place their own threads made of twisted linen cords, it is a great mistake: for the structure falls with them beyond its quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads do not suit again, because you do not achieve through the structure with them that which you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not suitable, so that it should be between the star-shaped (sutures) and the star-shaped, less than a finger.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	What if the weakened part is hurt through the ends of the star-shaped (sutures) after the structure in healthy places: then put under them a layer of soft stuffing or combed wool, until nothing is hurt from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with a wound, and disruption occurs in the skin, I will discuss it with remembrance of its singularity in the second chapter.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured member needs to be bound with star-shaped (sutures) from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	What is, because when the member is large, it is not suitable to place star-shaped (sutures) upon it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the occurrence of a warm aposteme.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of applying plaster, which the ancients used to restore, which are placed upon fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The method of common plaster, abbreviated, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially for women and children: because it is from that which neither heat nor cold overcomes.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, that you take from the dust of the mill, and it is the marrow of the flour which clings to the walls of the mill at the movement of the millstone: and mix it as it is, except that you sieve it with a thin layer of egg white: and put its confection not thick, nor subtle.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The method of another plaster, restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Here is the translation:
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then apply this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, quickly restores fractured bones, and benefits many men.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plastering, which also benefits fractures and sprains.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take myrrh, and mess, and white papyrus, of each an ounce X, and myrrh and aloe of both an ounce V, and Armenian bole VI, and twenty tartar emetic, all are ground into many particles, and are strained through a sieve, and are mixed with water or vinegar: and are administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Another method of plastering for joining and separating bones from their proper places: and it soothes accidental pain in them, and the separation of bones, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take lanolin fat, and soak it in vinegar, and decocted oil: and apply it to the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And indeed this plaster has no virtue of restoration, but it is good for soothing hot apostemes: and it expels pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Another method of plastering, which restores a fractured bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of sweet figs, and the leaves of wild parsley: and grind all, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Another method of abbreviated plastering, administered for the restoration of a fractured bone: and when you want to resolve the remaining inflammation of an aposteme.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of papyrus, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb powder, each a single part: all are ground, and mixed with wine, if the limb is not hot.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If indeed it is hot, then mix it with coriander water and humid, or with water, and apply it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of plastering, stronger in resolution, than that first one, when a hard aposteme occurs during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Here is the translation:
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	The whole of that which is secondary to the warmth of a member, and the quiet of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that anything should be applied to a fractured member for its restoration, unless it is made from wax and oil; nothing else. And he narrated that it should be a medium between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But to Galen it seemed best to apply to a fractured member for its restoration things in which there is an extraction of warmth, such as myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense, and similar things from those that we have narrated.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of applying a plaster that is suitable for a wound and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugwort and ciceris, and human hair clippings, or bird's feathers, and altaea, and equal parts of salt: grind them, and sieve them, and mix them together: and let an plaster be made from that.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity, however, according to what is necessary, so that the binding remains, then it dissolves, is that you should consider at that time, if there is no pain or discomfort, nor itching, nor does the fractured bone move from its place: then you will not resolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if there occurs to him in that place an intense itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling: then hasten, and dissolve it at that hour, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a gentle marine sponge, humid: and submerge it in tepid water, and wash the place with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain is assuaged.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the member rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put on it a succid wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it on for one night, until you are secure from a warm aposteme, and the inflammation of the member subsides, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then return it to a subtle stricture and a small poultice, and do not bind it with your first constriction, but subtly with it, until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	Since you see that the abscess, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all the accidents are now thoroughly removed, and you apply poultice and stricture, then return to that just as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	Since if nothing happens to the limb from those things that we mentioned, then do not release it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is released after twenty days, the whole thing, according to what appears to you from the solution of the limb, as we mentioned, until when the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh approximates over it: add also then more in the stricture than your first entire stricture: and add also in the thickening of food for the weak patient, according to what the preceding remembrance of it is.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture already drying out and withering more than it should: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Bathe it therefore with warm water at every joint where it is released, and let it be so for three days, and alleviate the stricture a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, nourishment will run to the limb, and it will heal quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which foolish restorers do from a fracture of the limb at another joint, when it is not restored at first as it should be, and is restored according to their twisted method, is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have written it in their books, and would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see any of their traces at all in that whole matter, and it is better, so that it would not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	About the accidental wound on the head.
Caput III.	Head 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The types of fractures are diverse, and its figures are many: and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture that occurs from a blow with a sword: and the blow carries through the whole bone up to the siphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an axis does in wood: and because of this it is called this type of fracture Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword strikes something of the bone, and strikes its surface, and does not penetrate to the end of it: and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Absolute Levation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture that is a compression or an abrasion: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the membrane, which is beneath the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and it is a wound of these two fractures also, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone in the subtlety of hair: and it is a small fissure, and because of this it is called this type of fracture Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And there is a fracture that occurs from a fall or blow of a stone and similar things, which cause the lamina of the bone to ingress inward, and it becomes concave: just as it happens to copper vessels, when they receive a blow, and part of them ingresses inward.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And indeed this occurs most often in the humid bones of the head, such as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And there are separate classifications for all these types of fractures, and I will discuss them with remembrance of the entire thing in its proper place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures by examination upon them, and inquiry into their conditions with tension, and the removal of corrupted flesh that is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species of hairline fracture is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, and wiped away, and anointed over it with a cautery: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of fractures, consider first the accidents of the injured person: then if you see from the accidents what manifest signs are apparent over fear, such as vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of intellect, and interruption of speech, and fainting, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes, and their redness, and similar things from the accidents in many dispositions, it is not doubtful that they will not be healthy: and if you see non-threatening accidents, and you hope for health: then begin the treatment of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What is, if a wounded person comes to you at first with a wound: and it is in winter days, then it is necessary that you hasten in the removal of bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in summer days, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest what is under the bone from the padding becomes corrupted, and those accidents occur which we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	What if the fracture of the bone has already reached the padding touching the brain, and it is with smallness, and attraction: then it is necessary that you cut into the comminuted part, and the attracted one, according to what I relate to you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, that you shave the head of the wounded person: and detect on the bone according to whatever mode is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is lightly upon the injured person.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	What if it happens to you upon detecting the bone a flow of blood, or a warm abscess: then oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is thus, that you should fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess settles, and you are secure from a flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method indeed is to cut the bone with a tight-binding forceps, and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another instrument after the first one, wider than it by a little; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer also another instrument, even wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is, that you have a number of diverse forceps: some of which are wider than certain ones, and some of them shorter than certain ones: and they should be at the end of their sharp extremities, and they should be made of iron or steel: and use facility in percussion on the forceps, so that it does not strike the head, and hurts it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is hard and strong: then it is necessary, that you perforate around it, before you administer the forceps, with drills which are called non-penetrating Drills: and they are not so named, unless because they do not pass through the boundary of the bony tissue to that which is behind it: therefore, since the Drill is a rounded extremity above what is under its sharp head, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents submersion, and piercing the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take from these Drills a large number, each of which is suited to the thickness of the bone, until there is present to you a Drill for every skull: whose sharp extremity's quantity in length and breadth is, according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three species of Drills, or Trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of piercing in the vicinity of a fractured bone is such that you place the Trephine on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone has already been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then you move the Trephine to another place, and put what is between all the holes a quantity of the thickness of the radius, or around that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then you cut with the Incisors what is between all the holes from the bone: and make it thinner than you can on the surface of the smoothness, as we said, until you remove the bone, or with your hand, or with some other instrument that you have prepared for that: such as forceps, and subtle hooks.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to beware with all caution, lest you touch the Trephine or Incisors with something from the sawdust.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have circumcised the bone by piercing, and it has been separated from the sawdust, if it was continuous with it, and you extract it, it is necessary to scrape, and equalize the extremity of what remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the Incisors.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thinner and more subtle than the other Incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	What remains from the small bones, and fragments: then take them with ease, with that which is at hand among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound afterwards with bandages, and ointments which we mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, far removed from fear: which Galen said, and praised it with great praise: and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin to detach the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most violent and most apparent: until when you have detached that part, and placed underneath it the extremity of this lenticular Incisor, whose shape is this.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part does not cut into anything, and its acute part presses on both sides of it along its length, as you see. So that the lens-shaped part is inclined towards the siphac, with its acute face cutting into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike the Incisor from one side with a small hammer, until you cut through the whole bone with ease, as it revolves. And be careful with the skin flap, lest something happens to it, which you would regret afterwards.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not more foolish than men, and more ignorant of it, nor asleep, then he would leave something attached to the bone from the skin flap in certain places, he would cut it away from it with the extremity of his lens-shaped Incisor, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not reach the skin flap, and what is cut away from the bone is its surface, and roughness and subtle projections remain in it: then it is necessary to smooth out that roughness, and remove those projections with subtle rasping instruments which you have prepared in various quantities, so that it may be possible for you to administer from them in every place more convenient and direct ones, according to what the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary for you to administer in your rasping, where you first smooth out the bone with the broader rasping instruments.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the more subtle ones after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you come to administer the most delicate and subtle of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every small remaining crack and subtle fracture of the hair-like filaments, it is necessary to administer care, according to what leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing which is not hidden from everyone, to whom in this art there is whatever study, and stands upon what we have written, and shows in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, the flap of skin is detected and held back, when you excavate the bone: then it is necessary, that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and submerge it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do that which you can most easily over it, so that it does not oppress the suture.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply the wide bandage over it: and do not tighten it, unless by the amount that holds the wound only just so much; and leave it with this care for one day, or two days, until you are secure from a warm aposteme.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it, and apply afterwards medicines with which there is excessive dryness: such as the roots of lily, and the flour of herb, and powder of frankincense, and aristolochia, and similar things; and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is powdered over the wound as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply to it all medicine from its property, which is that it cleanses and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care according to your skill, that the wound may be clear in your treatment: neither may there be dirty matter of ointment, nor filthiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Neither allow pus to collect in it at all: for when pus collects on the brain's skin, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and great evil happens to the weak afterwards; and now it happens in the suture of the head, when it is cleaned from the bone, especially when its treatment is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider then, if an accident befalls a weak patient which we have mentioned, it is pernicious and fraught with doubt.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur, unless from the medicine which is applied to it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine, so as to produce that blackness: then it is necessary to take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and to bind them with a linen cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put it on the wound; afterwards treat it with the means of healing that are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose is not fractured unless its two upper parts are simultaneously broken, or one of them: because they themselves are two bones; since its lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break and only suffers from attrition, twisting, and numbness.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts is fractured, then it is necessary to insert a small finger into the nostril and gently adjust the fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and this should be done skillfully and with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, lest you cause greater pain to the weak patient through your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach to the finger: then it is necessary to adjust the end of a rod, on which there is a small prominence.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed the fracture is in two parts, then do likewise; and strive for its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven days or ten, apply a gentle warmth with a cooling poultice.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the nostril a linen thread from a linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two threads if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be on the thread a prominence of such quantity that it fills the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And certain of the ancient restorers said that they should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That is not seen by me, rather it is necessary that the linen cloth be soaked in decoction of whey, mixed with powder of millet.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then apply the linen cloth until the bone becomes firm and the cartilage is indurated.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when a feather of a goose is inserted into the nostril in place of the linen cloth, after it has been wrapped with a soft cloth: and it happens that it holds the fracture of the nose very firmly, and so that it does not obstruct the breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not a necessary thing.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want, do that; and if you want, make linen cloths.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	What if it happens that the nose becomes putrid again while you are operating on an aposteme, apply a plaster to the nose with cerate, or with cotone infused in rose oil, or moderately with dyachylum.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if the hot aposteme does not occur, then it is necessary to apply a plaster made with flour of fenugreek, and powder of frankincense mixed with decoction of whey.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put a soft stuffing over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are broken into small fragments, or are crushed, then it is necessary to separate them above, and extract them with instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew up the wound, and care for it with that which brings flesh, and consolidate it with suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	What if a wound occurs within the nose, then it is necessary to care for it with linen cloths: and administer a pipe of lead, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jawbone when it is dislocated.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jawbone is dislocated and its fracture is not with a wound, consider then if its fracture is only outward, and it does not break into two, and curves inward; then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary, therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, to insert the index finger of the left hand into the mouth of the injured person; similarly, if the fracture is on the left jawbone, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push with it the curvature of the fracture from inside towards the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone, and adjust it accordingly.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	Because if the fracture of the jawbone is already separated into two, then it is necessary to administer extension from both parts, according to straightness, until its adjustment becomes possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however there has been a concussion or disruption of the teeth, then tie them together with a thread of gold, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put a cerate over the fractured jawbone.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put over it a doubled cloth, and place over the cloth a large star-shaped bandage made from the center; or an equal piece of leather from the sole of a shoe, in the length of the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it above, according to how the ligature is prepared for you, and its application is suitable, until it does not come apart; and instruct the patient to keep stillness and quiet; and give him light, soft food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If however you think that something has already changed in some way regarding the shape; then make haste and release it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from that, and apply a plaster made from flour of millet, with egg white, or with fine flour, after you have removed the cerate; and put over the plaster a soft wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	As long as the adjacent plaster remains on it, and the bone's disposition is not altered, leave it alone, do not release it, until it heals; or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often bound with three bandages.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	What if meanwhile a hot abscess happens, then administer what we have often mentioned for its soothing, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Now the fragment is separated from the bone, or from a splinter; then be subtle in this, so that you remove those fragments of the splinter with what is convenient to you in the removal of them by instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If the orifice of the wound is constricted, then enlarge it with a scalpel according to the quantity of your necessity.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those splinters, and none of them remain, then the orifice of the wound, if it is large: and if not, put over it from plaster that are suitable for that, and they will heal it, until it is cured.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the Cranium, when it is fractured.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The Cranium is indeed fractured from the front part near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it is fractured and separated into two, besides what happens to the splinters in it: and it is easier for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or it happens to the bone of the splinter: and it is more difficult for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in this case when the fracture is without a wound is to have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the instrument that follows the fractured Cranium, and the other stretches out the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers, until its shape is formed, according to what is fitting: and let there not be in it any eminences or concavities.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	What if you need to extend it more, then it is necessary, that you put under the title of the weak sphere a pad or a wool: and let its size be according to the quantity of your necessity: and extend, and lift the forked branch, and compress the sphere with your hand, until you reach an equal fracture, according to what is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	What if you cannot draw out the extremity of the forked branch to the exterior: because it reaches to the deep: then it is necessary, that the weak one is raised over his cervix: and you place under his shoulder a medium-sized cushion in magnitude, and press down his servant's shoulder towards the lower parts, until the bone of the forked branch which is in the depths rises upwards: and then you straighten the fracture, and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel something loose from the forked branch and it moves: then it is necessary, that you fix above that, and extract it, that loose thing with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is held fast in the bone, then you use ingenuity in its incision with one of the Incisors which you prepared for that, after you have placed under the forked branch an instrument that holds a sifach: and the instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is similar to a spoon which has not been hollowed out.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you need for the size of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	The length of it, however, is also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two extremities, as you see: and one extremity should be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the disruption of the wound which you saw when you extracted the loose bone is wide, and you are safe from the warm aposteme: then join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or a warm poultice is applied: then fill the wound with cotton pads, and apply a second layer according to the quantity of the wound's cleavage.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	What if a warm poultice is applied, then soak the cotton pad in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and put it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A fracture of the bone is when it is without a wound and without a cut, it is, that you should put on top of the bone a plaster made from flour of a mill with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put a soft padding over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a bandage under the lid of his eyelid, if it is inflamed.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a bandage, that is, a circular one which the Saracens hold, which should be long indeed: and its width should be one palm or approximately that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put a double layer of cotton pads over the padding and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a splint from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the splint in place of the bandage which falls on the fracture and location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then put the bandage over the fracture as it is turned around, and wrap it around his neck, and under his healthy eyelid, and under his diseased eyelid: and reduce it to every part, and as you see that the bandage holds the fracture in place decently: and it is this, that it should not be hidden from you, and entirely, so that the splint does not move away from the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, it is necessary to examine the diseased area every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	As often as the bandage becomes soft, and you see that the splint is already moving away: then straighten it out, and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put a small pillow of the weak person behind their back, and place a small cushion under their armpit near their spine at night, so that when they are lifted up, their helper may be at their side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	They will therefore be lifted by the fracture of the fork through the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the binding, unless it becomes inflamed at the site of the injury, or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see his face is inclined towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the bandage, and leave it, until it is restored and congealed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed the fracture of the fork is strengthened and comforted according to the greatest part in twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in certain men in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of the fracture of the Shoulder-blade.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The shoulder-blade is rarely fractured, and at its broad part: and they are not fractured except at their edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it is fractured at that place, and it is fractured in the middle of it, and it is not recognized unless by touch: then according to the shape of the fracture prepare its treatment.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural shape in every way of cleverness, as much as is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on the place a powder of flour mill with egg white, and a gentle padding, and put above it a small cushion made from doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on it a flat board from a subtle table according to the quantity of the entire shoulder-blade, or slightly larger than it.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed under the board is a concavity at some place of the shoulder-blade, then equalize that concavity with gentle padding, until the board descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then the surgeon should tighten it from above with a long constricting bandage, and fix it firmly with a star-shaped adhesive, so that it does not move out of its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And he should examine the ligature every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	As often as the ligature becomes soft, tighten it, and apply an equal star-shaped adhesive if it moves out of its place: and let the injured person lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the splint is indeed restored within twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is complete, then loosen the ligature: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is an injury of bones whose communion is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if a fragment of bone protrudes and pierces the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said about fracture of the craggy bone from the sedation of a hot poultice, if something happens because of it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Of the restoration of a fracture of the chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest when it is fractured in its middle, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	His limbs are indeed frequently fractured, and broken because of his falls.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When his chest is fractured, which declines to the lower parts, and he suffers severe pain, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps he vomits blood, and a concavity is declared in the fractured bone, and it does not escape notice. The restoration of it is, that the injured person lies on his back: and place under splints his mattress.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and bring together the ribs from both sides or flanks with your hands: and adjust them in their proper alignment, according to every method that is possible and suitable, until the shape of the bone returns, according to what is needed.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place above it a plaster and a compress, and place above it a thin plate from a smooth tablet, or from willow, or from similar things in a soft state, after you have wrapped it in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then bind it subtly over the fractured bone, so that it is not dislocated: and take care with the binding according to the roundness of the back several times, and constrict it with a decent compression.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the binding at every hour, and as often as it becomes soft, constrict it: and if its necessity calls for its solution at the time of itching, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or aposteme: then prepare, and dissolve it, and remove the plaster, and rectify what has occurred with the method of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see that it is for that purpose: and apply to it a compress, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of ribs, when they are fractured.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur, unless in thick places which follow the back, and from the extremities of these from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them by attrition, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the recognition of it is not hidden from sense during the examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in this way, that you equal the fracture with fingers according to the possible method, until it is equalized in shape, according to what is needed.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply a plaster, and constrict the fractured bone with a thin plate, if it needs that.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the interior: then it happens that a severe pain occurs, and a puncture, like the puncture which happens to one who has pleurisy: because, since the bone is severely pungent, and also difficulty in breathing occurs, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now the ancients are ingenious in these things with many inventions: and among them are those who say that you should apply foods to the sick person which generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the stomach becomes inflamed, and swollen, and a fracture is driven outward.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We however disapprove, lest it not make a bad cause for making a hot aposteme, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however it has already happened, then it adds to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them have said: let a poultice be applied to the windy place, then it should be pressed with force, and it is more like a rational consideration.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the poultice attracts windy excesses to the place, on account of the disposition of debility.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them have said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool that has already been soaked in hot oil: and poultices are applied between the ribs, until it is full: so that there may be an equal binding when you wrap it round according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person should be treated with a treatment of blisters, from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	Because if the tightness of the sick person's chest is vehement, which it does not tolerate, and the bone is pained by a puncturing wound, and we fear for the sick person: then it is necessary to split open the place, and to detach from the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we should apply to it an instrument that preserves a safac, whose memory has preceded: and we should make an incision into the bone with ease, and we should cut into it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we should bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and we should treat it with plasters, until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	Because if a hot aposteme happens in the meantime, then it is fitting, and inject poultices soaked in rose oil, and apply them to the place: and the sick person should be treated with what is suitable for the aposteme.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, let him be placed on his side on which he slept, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, when a fracture of the neck vertebrae occurs, and rarely does it happen with their dislocation; and similarly, the vertebrae of the back also.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When that happens to someone, and you want to know whether he will be healed or not; then consider it.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see that his hands are already numb, and paralyzed, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor constrict them; and when you constrict them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that he will not be healed, and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them, and feels constriction with your fingers and piercing; then know that the spinal bone is sound, and that the patient will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If it happens to the vertebrae of the back similarly to that, and you want to know whether he will be healed or not; then consider his feet: then if you see that they are numb, and the same thing happens to them as happened to his hands: next when he lies on his back, wind and excretion come out without his will; and when he turns onto his stomach, excretion comes out without his will; and when he turns onto his back, and wants to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Do not therefore struggle with his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing happens to him from that, the case is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what happened from that is to attempt a gentle sedation of the affected area with warm compresses; thus, you should put rose oil only on the dislocated vertebrae; or with roasted egg yolks.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Here is the translation:
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And he should not sleep on the affected part with which he finds pain, until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	What if it happens because of the friction of a broken bone, or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary to sew up over the skin, and to remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some kind of flesh-growing application, from ointments, until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If, indeed, the last bone of the spine is broken, and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary to put the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and to straighten the fractured bone with the other hand, as much as possible, and in a secondary straightening.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put on it, and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment that preceded, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the Restoration of the Anchor-shaped Bone.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The anchor-shaped bones are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	When they are broken, then their fracture is not, unless there is a comminution at the extremities of the same: and they split along the length, and decline towards the interior: and there occurs a weak pain in the place, and a puncture: and the leg that is broken becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And indeed its restoration is to extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture in whatever shape it is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at the extremities of it, then equalize that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from the straightening, until it is assimilated to its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If the fracture is along the length, or has already declined towards the interior: then make the weak part rest on its belly, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have equalized it, put a plaster over it: then put a splint made of wood or leather over it, and bind a tight strapping over it, so that you do not fear the shifting of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And he should sit with those equalizing it with what fills it, until it captures the structure according to equality; and especially for the weak, so that they sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If a warm abscess occurs to him: then cease from extending it, and its restoration, until the warm abscess settles; and put on it what sits on it, according to what has preceded, then return to its restoration: and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If a septic condition occurs in the bone, or it becomes putrid, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the Helper.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The Helper is that which is between the elbow and the head of the Spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it is therefore fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two modes.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligatures are tied at the two extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it should be suspended from an elevated place: and the weak person should sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should lean his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the joint of his elbow, where the crookedness of the wood is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above it, so that it stretches the servant to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor should equalize the fracture with his hands, until the fracture is reassembled, according to what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another mode is that the weak person should recline on his pillow: and his hand should be suspended from his neck with a ligature.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then order two servants to hold it, one of them holding what is above the fracture with his hands: and let the other hold below it, and each of them should stretch towards their own part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish, so that the extension may be stronger, then bind below the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage: and each of the two assistants will extend it to their two respective parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the articulation of the shoulder, then it is necessary to put one bandage below the nipple and another below the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary to put a bandage over that place and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture with ease without effort, until when the fracture is equalized according to what is necessary, and a good application is made: then bind it, if a warm apostem does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If a warm apostem occurs, then loosen the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on it a pledget of wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the apostem quiets down: then bind it: and the manner of binding is to put a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then add the arm to the assistant itself, and place his hand open upon his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put on a cloth, and bind over the assistant's arm, so that the arm stands in its place like a star: if nothing prevents you from it, nor is anything altered about you because of the fractured bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If sometimes, because of the fractured bone, something is altered about you, then use a star-shaped bandage: and it is, that you put on the fracture itself a star-shaped bandage which is wider and stronger than other star-shaped bandages.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And put on the width of a finger between each star-shaped bandage: and let the length of the star-shaped bandages be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then thread a suture over the star-shaped structure which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is so that your suture should be stricter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is elongated, the less tight should be the suture.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If you see the star-shaped structure and the suture, as we have said, at the time when you restore the member suddenly, then do it: and if you apply a warm poultice, then release the suture and the star-shaped structure until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for three days, so that there may not occur irritation at the site, or inflammation, or be prevented from receiving nourishment to the member, due to the excessive tension of the suture.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct the whole thing, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If you are confident in your faith, so that nothing happens to it from that: then do not loosen the ligature, unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the weak patient sleep on his back, and his hand on his stomach: and place a full cushion of equal lanolin under his support.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night or day, so that the shape of the fractured member is not loosened, or the ligature is not softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore correct the whole thing with your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give food to the weak patient according to the order which we have prescribed, so that the food is subtle at first, until the fracture begins to consolidate: then it is necessary to increase his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is customary for the hip and thigh to be bound for forty days: then therefore it is necessary to loosen, and to administer a bath, and to medicate with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture was foul and bruised: then do not loosen the ligature and star-shaped structure until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the Restoration of Fractures of the Arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is small and it is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is the one that is placed below the small one on the lower side.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the larger humerus is fractured alone, or the smaller one; and perhaps they are both fractured together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When the smaller humerus above is fractured, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower humerus is fractured, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones are fractured together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is fractured is the smaller humerus above, then it is fitting for the doctor, in restoring it, to apply a small extension with ease, until it is made equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If on the other hand the larger humerus is the one that is fractured: then it is necessary to apply a stronger traction indeed.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to apply the shape of the hand at its restoration, and its own extended extension above the pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers above: and let the joint below be inferior to all the fingers, or the remaining ones: and let the weak one sitting squarely on himself, and let the pillow be before him, or in a direct line with him, at a height, so that the weak one does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the assistant extends the arm from the lower part, or with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant extends it from above in a similar way.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor adjusts the bone until he reduces it to its better shape as much as possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are splinters in the fracture of the bone, then try to reduce each fragment to its own place with your virtue.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed it appears to you that the separated sathaiatum is festering, and it pains the skin, and there is no hope of its restoration: then place upon it, and remove it according to the method which we described in the preceding cases.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If the fracture is with a wound, I have already dealt with that chapter singularly, therefore take the treatment of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If it happens that at the beginning of your restoration a hot aposteme occurs, then apply a linen cloth with a warm cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be a mean between thickness and subtlety: and bind the cloth over it with a subtle string, until the aposteme is ripe: then remove the cerate, and put on a prepared plaster made from powdered millstone and egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on splints, and let the splint that is put on the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints on the arm is six in most dispositions: whether the fracture is in one forearm or in two forearms at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put your bandage over the place of the fracture stronger and more violent, and a little more with the bandage to the upper part of the fracture, or to its lower part: or put a softer bandage, a little weaker, according to what was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture be soft, moist cloths: and not hard, rough ones.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is bound be a linen one, properly made, medium between subtle and thick, as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and ligament after some days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens that requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the member: then it is necessary to bathe the member with warm water until that itching ceases, and to release the member unbound, until it quiets down, then tighten the bandage again.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the stricture has already become softened and the bone is already remote, and similar things: then correct the whole thing with your strength, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if the nutrient is prevented from reaching the member because of the abundance of the stricture, then it is necessary to soften it for a short time and let it go for some days, until it flows back to the nutrient, and then constrict it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, none of the things we mentioned happens to the patient, then it is not necessary to release it, unless after twenty days or around that time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the hand of the patient be suspended at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be equal, and let it be guarded by its own strength against agitated motions.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it will be restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	The whole thing depends on the dispositions of the complexions and the dispositions of the strengths.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 13.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture rarely occurs in the skin of the hand and in the nodes of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to them unless there is repeated rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, when fracture of the sole occurs, or rubbing: then it is necessary for the patient to sit squarely, and let his seat be in front of him according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand on it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant extends the broken bone, and the physician adjusts it, until they join together with a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to apply an emplaster and a poultice, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then put the splint on top according to the size of the place: and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is around the lower part of the sole of the foot, then make a similar sphere out of cloth: and place it under the injured person, so that it presses on the fractured area along with its own plantar surface; then bind it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let there be a small star-shaped device made of leather, in which there is gentleness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the foot with gentleness; and bind it, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is on the outer side, then it is necessary to place a star-shaped device above and another below on the sole of the foot; and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put on a bandage, as the hand is revolved, and extend it between the toes with a ligature.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture occurs at any of the nodes of the toes, then if it is the thumb, it should be adjusted according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it with a splint: and if you desire, place on it a small, straight star-shaped device, so that the fracture is elevated, and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is of the remaining toes, such as the middle, index, or ring fingers, then it should be adjusted and bound with a healthy toe that follows it; or they should all be bound together according to their continuity; and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place on top of it a small star-shaped device, as we mentioned for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the aforementioned disposition of a warm poultice; and oppose with it what is necessary, when something happens from that, according to how its narrative proceeds.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Concerning the Restoration of Fractures of the Hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often fractured and is revealed by sensation: because it turns inward and outward to the front and back parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in this way, that a ligature is bound above the fracture, and another ligature below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient is laid out on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then every ligament is extended to its own part according to equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If, however, there is a fracture near the root of the hip, then let the ligament be towards the part of the buttock, so that the extension falls upwards: and another ligament beneath the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly, if there is a fracture near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension is towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician equals the bone with both his hands, until he reduces it according to the similarity of its natural figure: and he connects the bone with a good conjunction.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply an emplastry and a bandage, if there does not occur an abscess in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for some days, until the hot abscess subsides, and afterwards return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage of it should be thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to apply a soft envelopment over the fracture, that is, a binding: and double or triple it: and let what is excessive remain on it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then envelop the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the hip.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee towards the lower parts, and let the ends of the threads unite at the upper part of the two sections.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll back what is excessive over the leg and hip from the envelopment.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the hip at the location of the fracture itself a little star, and place one of them on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill in the empty spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the bandage is equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage in the middle over the location of the fracture, three or four envelopments.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as much as it is more elongated with a bandage at the place of the fracture, your structure will be smaller and softer, and more gentle.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then attend to the two extremities of the cord, which you have inserted between the hip and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind it therefore with three splints that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then pass with the two extremities of the cord to below, until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both strings, also bind the extremities of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then leave the structure on that, as long as it remains, so that there does not occur corrosion of the limb, nor abscess, nor inflammation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Provide therefore with its treatment, and correct what has happened there entirely, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed there is a splinter of bone that pierces: then it is necessary, to equalize that, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find above that, and remove that: and take care with what preceded the treatment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is bound, besides what splints are added to it, as we have said in the case of the arm and forearm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of a fracture of this kind, there does not occur a weak limping.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides what the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary, that he whose it is, always limps.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little more, or a little less: all of that is according to the diversity of complexions and the remaining dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of a fracture of the kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Head 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that fracture of the knee joint rarely occurs, but it often happens to him with frequent sprains.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If, indeed, a fracture occurs to him, then it is not unless either a crack or an opening in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with a wound and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands upon the whole of it with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is thus, that it may be equalized what has been disrupted from its parts with fingers, until it aggregates and is joined together as much as possible from equality and facilitation, and formation.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put a plaster made from flour of emmer wheat or millet, with the white of an egg, and put above it a round stave, if you need it; and bind above it a suitable strapping to hold it in place.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions that we have narrated about other fractures; such as a warm poultice and similar things to it; thus, that you may oppose every accident with what is convenient for it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the Restoration of Fractures of the Leg.
Caput XVII.	Head 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that there are two bones in the legs, of which one is thick and is named by the name of the Leg; and the other is subtle and is named the Fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens that both bones of the leg are subject to the same types of fracture as those of the arm; and because of this, its restoration is made in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	What if both bones are broken at the same time, the Leg is converted to all its parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the subtle bone is broken, the Leg is converted to the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thick bone is broken, you will find it inferior; and it is one of those things that do not hide from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and adjustment, and ligature of the stellar bones according to that equality.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, it is necessary, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having many stitches: so that the extension should be minor, and your alleviation more gentle.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And on the leg indeed there is something from the operation above the arm: and it is, when you adjust the stellar bones, and complete all your operation, then take two bandages of pine wood, which are administered in the fabrication of splints that are placed under the tables: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from them those that have small thickness, and not be from minute ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down to the bottom.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap around each bandage with two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie two bandages in three places, from the two extremities and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the stricture is prohibited, the leg declines to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed the splint is administered from wood according to the length of the leg, and the leg is placed in it, so that it may conserve it from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is especially necessary, to do that in the fracture when there is a proper wound with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and study it with utmost care to prevent aposteme, or inflammation, or other remaining things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore something happens from those, then oppose it with what is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, a fracture does not occur deep in the heel bone.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, a fracture of the foot bones occurs when it does, and a small fracture also occurs in the toes; and it does not occur unless there is bruising in multiple locations.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture of the foot bones occurs, and you see those bones protruding above each other, then the patient will place his injured foot on the prepared ground, just like someone walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand there, and place your foot on what is elevated from those bones; afterwards press, or tread on it; and equalize it, until it returns to its proper places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put on a plaster, and apply a bandage over it; and place under the foot a small flat board, which has two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a suitable strap along with the foot, after you have wrapped it with cloths, and other things which it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three days or four have passed for him, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones equalized, whether they were fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation is therefore successful, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if some toes are broken, then restore them, and equalize them according to what I narrated to you about the restoration of fingers on hands.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put a splint on your toe according to the length of the toe, and let it be slightly wider; then put under the foot the board that I described to you, and bind it with a suitable strap.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed what is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then put a splint of its own quantity on each toe, wrapped in linen cloth: and bind the board to the lower foot; and let it stand on one head of the board outside the belly of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you not to forget, that you should consider all the things we have told you about the remaining fractures from the accidents we have mentioned; and oppose every accident with what is suitable.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	About the fracture of a woman's pubic bone, and the fracture of the os Pubis, and the fracture of a man's penis.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the pubic bone of a woman is fractured, then make her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her to the same dorsal part, and let it be held back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then fill the obstetric instrument with her pubic bone, until it fills it: and let it be made into a sphere in the pubic bone from that.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman is shaken, and her back is raised little by little.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cavity emerges, until it becomes a sphere before the gate of the pubic bone, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a small pillow on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When therefore she wants to urinate, remove the cavity with ease, then let her urinate: and return it according to the method by which you first introduced it; then let it return to its original pillow.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do that for seven days or around that time, for the bone is indeed restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a bladder of a goat, and tie over the opening of it a reed pipe, and insert the whole bladder into her pubic bone.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the pipe with strength, until the bladder is inflated inside the pubic bone, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it is filled with a cavity, and let it stand for some days, according to what we have narrated, until she is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the pelvis of a man or woman is fractured, then administer its restoration, and balance it according to what we have narrated for the ankle bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And it is not hidden in these fractures that are close together, which touch a little, especially to one who has some knowledge or practice.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book, this one much, because the fracture itself shows you the way to restore it in many arrangements, and its constriction: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the twig of a man breaks, take the gullet of a goose: and insert the twig into it itself.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put a wrapping of cloth over it, and let it be wrapped, and leave it for three days or around that, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of bones, when it is with an ulcer.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for one to whom a fracture with an ulcer has occurred, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or the adjoining ones, or similar to them, that they be treated promptly, and phlebotomists attend to it immediately: if the conditions of phlebotomy are testified to you, as we have mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	When the ulcer bursts forth with blood, then it is necessary to apply a poultice to its excision, so that you may dust it over with powdered zegi: if there is not another remedy present for you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not put it off, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If a hot abscess occurs, then postpone the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, lest you cause bad accidents to happen to it.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the broken bone is prominent above the detected wound: then it is necessary to try to reduce it, and adjust it with your hands using gentle and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If the extension of it is not prepared, and its adjustment with your hands: then reduce it with that instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the measure of seven fingers, or eight; and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of that, it is necessary for the physician to receive from them three or four according to the size that he needs for that cure in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round; and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it is not doubled at the time of compression upon it during the hour of operation; and let it have an acute extremity, which has an edge at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be in thickness from the middle of it to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the acute curved extremity of it be placed over the prominent bone extremity; and push it with one force, until when the bone returns and is equalized by some equalization.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, make the extremities of the fracture equal to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the fractured extremity is subtle and does not receive the instrument with good reception, then it is necessary to cut into the extremity of that bone, until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed you cannot reduce them with what we have narrated altogether, then cut into it with what is convenient for it from the incisions that we have mentioned: or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way possible to you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape off what remains on the bone from roughness and minute crusts.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone is reduced and finds that it is weak after its reduction and feels a violent, piercing pain, then know that the bone did not return to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you bring great benefit to the weak, when you complete your restoration, which you do for the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then soak a cloth in styptic wine, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not apply it to ulcerated wounds, nor anything in which there is oil: so that it does not cause decay and corruption.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the oils at the time of your recovery for the restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And uncover the wound: thus, that you may cut with forceps into the inversions according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with all caution, lest you constrict the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times indeed have foolish physicians done this: and they have caused to happen to their sick patients either death or decay, or gangrene, that is, putridity.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your bandage be soft, gentle, and diverse in the bandaging of remaining fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	For if the wound is bad, or it is a great wound, and there are certain evil accidents that we have described, and you find pain in the suspended place: then it is not fitting to apply oils to it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make inversions with hard cloths in the place of the oils, and constrict it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to generate pus: then remove from above the cloth that you had applied with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer the liniments, and ointments with which it is our custom to heal wounds: such as the four-drug ointment, and similar to that.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary to prepare the limb in such a way that pus flows out of it easily downwards with facility.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days have passed over the wounds and they do not consolidate, nor is the pus separated from them: then know that there are small ulcers of the bones.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	It is necessary to investigate the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	Indeed those which are separated from the ulcers, remove them, and extract themselves.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those which are not separated from them, and pierce the membrane, and cause to happen pain, try to cut them out, and remove them in every way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If it happens that the wound becomes infected, or turns foul, that is, becomes putrid, or another kind of corruption and decay: then it is necessary to apply a remedy to each one of them with what is suitable for its cure, whose preceding narration is in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that in which it is necessary for my speech to stand, and you should have a present mind when the bone is fractured, and it protrudes above the membrane, such as the hip bone, and the assisting ones, and similar ones from the large members, it is, so that you do not assume an attraction of it, for many times it happens from that death, or rather, abandon it, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps indeed it will fall off by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore treat the wound, if it seems to you: and if not, abandon it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of swellings in fractures of the vertebrae.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This swelling often occurs in the healing of fractures of the vertebrae.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially when it is near the joints: and it becomes deformed from the shape of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider then, if the swelling is recent: administer to it medicines that have drying properties, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocola, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, take some of these or all of them and mix them with wine styptic, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and apply them to the wound in a compress, and bind them on with a good bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the bandage on, without loosening it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another, until the wound is healed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind on a plate of lead centered over it.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing every pain that is felt in the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the wound has already turned into a hard scab, and is constricted, and a pressing necessity arises to remove it: then apply something over it from above, and cut away the redundant prominence: or shave it off with certain razors, until it is removed: and take care of it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and a subtle member remains after that, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored, and a subtle member remains after that, weak: then it does not become sound unless due to many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is, the multitude of solutions and bindings not according to what is needed: or due to the excess of constricting bandages, until nourishment is prevented from reaching the member: or due to the multitude of superfluous embrocations at an improper time: or due to the paucity of blood in the weak body, and its debility.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment for that is to nourish the weak person, and to make their body tender, until the blood is multiplied in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and happiness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then apply pitch over the member: so that it attracts much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And you should repeatedly soften it with warm water, until the nourishment starts to flow, and it returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored to their proper alignment.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When a member is already restored after its healing, and the twistedness and prominence of the fractured bone or knot remain, and it is deformed by that shape of the member; yet the member is not prevented from performing its natural operation: then it is not necessary to receive the message of one who thinks that the member will be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And already there have been many foolish doctors and restorers, who have done that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And indeed this operation is utterly detestable, leading to death or great fear, as if it were mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the numbness and knotting are recent: then it is necessary to soften them with warm water, in which are decoctions of herbs that soften, such as leaves of marshmallow, and its root, and melilot, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let there be made for him a plaster with a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let there be taken a poultice of marshmallow root, and it should be mixed with the fat of a hen, or sesame oil: and it should be plastered on with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let there be taken rich figs, and they should be crushed with dove's dung, and similar things which are named from medicines that diminish consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the knot is loosened with gentle, prolonged, and gentle friction, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the member should be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the twistedness has already preceded, and has become strong, and has turned into a stone, and necessity has provoked the need for its treatment with iron: then it is necessary to cut above it, and release the continuity of the bone, and remove what is superfluous from the knot or bone with subtle Incisions: and ease should be administered in that with solicitude and study.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	About the treatment of dislocations.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is the exit of a joint from its proper place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it is prevented from its natural movement, and the shape of the limb is deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes to occur severe pains and vehement injuries on the weakened area.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore a dislocation occurs, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration: and not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes putrid, and perhaps with that, reduction of the dislocation will be more difficult.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it is not advisable to move or stretch it during the time of its putrefaction.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes spasms and lacerating pains.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then it is necessary to resort to bloodletting of the weakened area.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it should be left alone until the putrefaction subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And the whole limb should be treated with that which will bring its memory back to its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have now arranged the chapters on dislocations, and also according to what has preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	About the treatment of dislocation of the lower jawbone.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jawbones are rarely dislocated at the same time.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are removed from their places with a slight removal, and are softened for a short time.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated with a complete dislocation, until they are softened towards the chest, until saliva flows from the weakened area, and it cannot hold it, nor can it close its mouth, and its tongue is tangled with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When the dislocation of it is small, then it returns to many dispositions by itself with fewness.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If the dislocation is complete and entire: then it is necessary that the reduction of it be administered quickly, and not delayed at all; and it is as if the servant head of the weak patient holds still, and the physician inserts the thumb of their hand into the root of the mandible of the dislocated jaw, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts both thumbs simultaneously, if the dislocation is from two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hands are outside, which are equal.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the patient to cleanse their jaws, and release them for chewing on all sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician balances the jaw, and pushes the jaw, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved at the same time: then administer a fumigation with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy; nor delay the reduction of both altogether, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they return and are balanced, and the patient's mouth is closed, and not relaxed: then put over them a poultice of old cloths, with wax that is made from beeswax, and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then bind with a facilitative binding using soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient sleep on their back: and let his head be stationed between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left; nor is it constricted, or cogitated to chew anything: indeed, let his food be given in a soft sorbitio, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is settled: then let him eat what he wants, and administer it with facilitation.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let him not exert himself over the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and kissing, until the jaw is settled, and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of two jawbones becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some hour and do not return to their places, then frequently fevers and constant pains occur; and perhaps the weakened stomach is relaxed, and perhaps it vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Since you see that, then know that it is a loss, and frequently one dies who suffers that within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Concerning the reduction of a dislocated elbow, and the extremity of the shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The elbow indeed does not become dislocated from the inner side, on account of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it becomes dislocated sometimes to the outer sides, and that is made clear by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, that the weak person should lie on his back, and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then you should bind the place with a strong bandage of your palm, for it will return to its position.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put on top of it an emplaster, and poultices, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities, indeed, which follow the elbow, and are connected with it, do not become dislocated, unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it becomes dislocated on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and set in order according to what we have said, and what has been prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put on top of it an emplaster, and poultices, and a tightening bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the weak person to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until they are healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the extremity of the shoulder is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Concerning the reduction of a dislocated shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder is not dislocated, except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of them is to be displaced towards the lower parts of the perineum.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is to be displaced towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is displaced towards the upper part of the shoulder, and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not displaced backwards, because of the blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not displaced forwards, because of the veins.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed it is most often displaced and protrudes towards the lower parts near the perineum: especially in those whose flesh is lean.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it protrudes quickly in them, and is reduced quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that, namely because it protrudes with difficulty, and is reduced with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men that they receive a blow or a fall, and the shoulder is affected by a hot abscess, and it is thought because of that, that it was already displaced.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary, therefore, to test that until you stand upon certain knowledge of it, and then proceed with its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the displacement is recognized when it is towards the lower parts near the perineum: and you distinguish between a displaced shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a clear difference between them, and you find a concavity in the head of the shoulder, and under the perineum upon touching the head of the shoulder as if it were a hollow: and the weak one cannot reduce his hand to his ear, nor move it with all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is displaced towards the chest or upwards: then you find a clear and obvious touch, and it does not hide.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed the reduction of this displacement is easy, when it is recent, or the patient is a weak boy.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, that the assistant raises their hand to the upper parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under the patient's eyelid, and with great strength lift it upwards to its proper place: and serve with your hand, and stretch it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then put it down below, for it will return quickly on its own.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if it does not return through what we have said, and there are many days since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary for the injured person to be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation should be administered that softens and soothes, such as if roots of altea, and fenugreek, and melilot are decocted in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the injured person should be raised up on their back: and a sphere and wool should be placed under their eyelid, which is balanced between gentleness and firmness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place his heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the humerus with strength, and attract the hand of the injured person downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another person should hold the head of the injured person, so that it does not move downwards: for it will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is, that you should make the strong man who is longer than the injured person present, and stand at his side, and insert his humerus under the eyelid of the injured person: and lift his eyelid upwards, until the injured person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another person should pull the hand of the injured person downwards towards his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the injured person is lightweight: then it is necessary to suspend something else with him, so that it weighs him down: for the dislocation will return immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is reduced also according to another method: and it is, that a long wooden beam is fixed in the ground, whose head has a rounded figure: like a mason's hand-guard: which should not be thick, nor too subtle.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let it be placed under the injured part after they are placed on top of a soft cloth headrest, and let the injured part stand upright according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand is extended to the lower part of the other side, and his body is extended from the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place with swiftness.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is, to take a wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: which has a round head, so that its entrance may be alleviated into the deep tissue, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied around the round head, so that they do not harm the injured wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it is placed under the injured tissue, so that the hand or arm may be extended onto the wood up to the lower parts: and the wood is tied over the assistant and arm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm is placed on a step of a ladder by width, and the hand is extended to the lower parts, and the rest of the body is suspended hanging from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore the entrance is completed according to whatever mode possible: then it is necessary to place under the tissue a sphere of equal quantity made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then put the prepared plaster made from mill dust with olive oil and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it revolves back to its place.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind underneath the tissue a suitable strapping: and the ligament is revolved over the plaster above: and his hand is attached to his neck, and let it be left untouched, so that his hand may not be moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to put light food in front of the injured person, until the limb is comforted: because it is quicker for his healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger bandage should be put on after seven days, or five, and it should be tightened with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is then strengthened and not softened, then he is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture that happens to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary to administer a cautery with three probes, according to what was previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	What if all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and bandage are applied many times, and it does not firm up, and it falls apart, and cannot be lifted to its former position: then know that the nerves that are at the head of the humerus have already been cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its proper place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	Dislocations that occur towards the chest and nipple, or towards the back, are reduced with impulse and extension using the hands: until it returns to its place, and the remaining bandage and care are administered, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	What if after healing a heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then let the weakened person use a bath many times, until that heaviness is alleviated, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty also: and it itself dislocates to all parts, and especially to the front or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it falls under your sight and touch, according to whatever shape it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with a healthy one, that becomes clearly apparent to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For it is joined together and cannot bend its arm, nor can it touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary, as you approach, to reduce the dislocation at once, before a warm abscess forms on it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a warm abscess forms on it, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it will not heal entirely, especially when it is on the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is the worst of all kinds of dislocations, and of the most violent pain to them; and many times it ends with death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration, when it is among those that are possible to reduce, is that the hand of the patient should be extended with both hands: and his arm should be stretched out, and the doctor's hands should be above the elbow and below it, and he himself should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the heel of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or if the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he bends his hand with his own hand, until he strikes with the heel of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	What if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer a strong and forceful extension: and it is thus, that two assistants should stretch out the arm: and those two assistants should hold it as well, so that it does not move back during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm should be bandaged to every part after a long, doubled cloth or a broad bandage is applied over his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil: so that it is among those things that help to lubricate the joint and make it more flexible.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he pushes the joint with a strong impulse, until it returns to its place.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary to apply a plaster over it, on which there should be a powder of stipticity, and an application with albumen water: and a suitable bandage should be tightly bound.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the weak person, and let it be left for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then the joint is firmly fixed in its place, then loosen the bandage from it, and let it be.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the joint is not well strung, then apply a plaster, and a bandage, and let it be for some days, until it becomes strong.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however it happens that there is heaviness after the reduction of the joint, and the arrangement is in motion: then administer moisture in bathing, and subtle friction, and compression, until it becomes smooth, or put over the joint a greasy ointment, namely, a rich fatty substance.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then let it be bound, and let it be left on it for a day and a night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and introduce it into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply to it a first, second, and third ointment, one at a time, with the entrance of the bath, until it becomes smooth.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, put on it a warm, moist, and heated dung plaster, with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It itself becomes smooth, and returns to its own arrangement.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of a dislocation by Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The hand of Mahassem is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of his dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of his dislocation at the hour in which it becomes dislocated, before the place becomes inflamed; or else a hot abscess may occur.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in this is, that you should place your weak hand on the table, and stretch out your other hand; and the physician should place his own palm on the prominence of the joint, and push it, until it returns to its place.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider that if the palm has already receded towards the back of the hand: then the weak person should place the back of their hand on the table at the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation progresses towards the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be placed inwardly on the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table, so that the physician's hand falls upon the same prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster dressing the swelling: and leave it, without repeating that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you achieve reduction, after the days have passed, however the joint remains crooked according to its own twist: and it does not harm the weak person at all, unless the hand becomes soft, and cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves are cut or injured.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no ingenuity in this, except to bind it with a hot iron near the fracture itself.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps that does not help at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore the dislocation does not return to its place, then put on it a plaster, which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then bind it, and let it be for five days: afterwards unbind it and let it be, and exercise the hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if its movement is restricted, and some heaviness occurs in it: then soften it with warm water, and rub it several times, until it becomes soft.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the treatment of dislocations of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from its joint, or from the back of the palm, or from its front: then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb, until it returns to its place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the fingers, and suspend it towards the part where it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it until it becomes straight on that day of its own.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore the night has become calm, bind it according to its own narrative: and do not cease to loosen it on that day: and exercise it with motion: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days until it becomes stiff.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do likewise with it, if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand: and bind it to that same part, and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do likewise with it when it is dislocated towards the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the vertebrae of the back are dislocated, or a complete dislocation of the neck occurs, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no treatment for this, because death quickly follows for the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the sick person's evacuation happens without their will, nor can they hold it: and often certain members of theirs become soft because of this, such as one of his legs, or two arms, or one of them: or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is removed, because often there is removal to the four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed towards the back is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of it is, as you should consider then, if Gibbosity occurs from childhood: then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any healing at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In that which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or similar things, the ancient ones have already spoken of methods of treatment in a lengthy discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	He who does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I, however, have already abbreviated it from that, which excuses little of its multitude in proximity to my intention; and I have set forth my exposition as I have exhibited it, and have formed the instrument in a diverse manner from what they have shown, and have set it forth.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore I say that the hump-shaped prominence which occurs on the anterior part is not a natural talent, nor a healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly, in that which is done for the two sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not treated from them, unless that which occurs on the back properly, as I describe: and it is, that the weak person is stretched out on his face on a level platform near the wall: and a moist cloth is spread under him, so that his chest is not hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight wooden stick is placed fixed in the ground at the end of the bed, near his head: and another stick near his feet at the other end of the bed: and an assistant holds the stick, and it should not be firmly fixed in the ground.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another assistant holds the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then a soft wrapping is put over the head of the weak person, and under his eyelids a gentle ligature is firmly tied: and the extremity of the ligament is extended to the stick that is near his head: and it is bound to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then another ligature is tightened above his haunches, and above his knees, and at his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then all the ligatures are gathered together, and they are bound to the other stick that is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then all the assistants stretch out to the part of the stick with the ligature, and the two sticks are not removed from their places where they are fixed: however, they should not be firmly fastened, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician places his hands on the vertebra with strength, until it returns to its place: or he places it on a tablet.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he should place his feet on a table, so that they hang down.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, it does not respond to this treatment, then take a table whose length is about three cubits.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And let the leg be placed on the wall of the thing we mentioned, which is near the patient, the place into which the end of the table enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then put a cushion in the middle of the table on the vertebrae.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him pull strongly, so that the vertebrae is constricted, and returns to its own place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a turning instrument that is wrapped with your hand; and it is so that you fix two wooden pieces on the ground near the head of the patient at the end of the bed, each one cubit long; and likewise near his head at the end of the bed, two wooden pieces.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length between each wooden piece be one palm; and now a hole has been made in every place where the turning instrument runs; and let all the wood be fixed firmly to the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let a round wood be inserted; and it is a turning instrument on which the ligament is wound around in the two holes of the two wooden pieces.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And on its end is a hole, where the wood is fixed, whose length is one palm with that which is wound around; and in the two other wooden pieces there are similar ones.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then pull the ligaments that you have bound on the chest of the patient with the turning instrument that is at his head; and the ligaments that you have bound on his legs with the turning instrument that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then a servant stands at every turning instrument, who twists his hand with the rope, with which the turning instrument is wound; and the doctor sets the vertebrae in place, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of a wound that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after the swelling has gone down, and the place is even, then it is suitable to apply a drying poultice with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a dressing.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards, place above the poultice a small plate made from a tablet, whose width is three fingers, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the amount that covers the place of the gibbosity, and over the healthy part of the spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with a bandage which we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the patient be nourished with subtle sustenance until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something of the swelling remains in the place at the end of the healing: then it is suitable to administer medicines that soften and ease, with the application of the plate which we described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now it is applied on that sheet of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when a swelling occurs at the last vertebra of the back: and it is thought to be a dislocation through that, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not suitable to make a assumption for him with this medicine: perhaps indeed it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the joints of the ankle and the joints of the shoulder do not occur unless there is a dislocation only: nor does it happen to them what happens to other joints from slight removal and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed, the ankle joint is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which is, because it is dislocated forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed, it is most often dislocated inwardly: and little dislocated forward and backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its inward dislocation is this: because when you join the weak leg with the healthy one, it is longer: and its knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the weak one cannot bend his foot at the groin: and there is a place that follows the groin, marked by a hot apostema, therefore, because the head of the hip has already arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of the one who suffers from a dislocation towards the exterior is what are the contrary accidents of those accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of the one who suffers from a dislocation towards the front is that it stretches the healthy leg according to its complement: truly it does not bend it without pain which is in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot do so towards the front: and his urine is retained, and his groin is inflamed, and during walking there is a weariness upon his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of the one who suffers from a dislocation towards the back is that it does not stretch the knee, nor can he bend it until he bends the groin: and his leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this type of dislocation is indeed thus, that you should consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already become accustomed to the one having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its own disposition: then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it is not suitable that a deep supposition should be made about it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that case where the dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four species of dislocations: then you should strive for this, that you may join the ends, and extend it to the interior and exterior, and move it to the right and left: perhaps indeed it will return, and does not require another cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and to extend his leg from the lower part: either with his own hands, or with a bandage, which is tied above his knee: and another assistant extends his hand above, so that he may insert his hands under his buttocks.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should bind with a soft bandage around the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the extension be from the front of the thigh to the part of the groin, or from the back to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let their extension be in one way only, until the weak person is lifted with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this indeed is a type of extension that is a common type of the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type to add that which I will say about proper healing.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of this proper type, when the dislocation is towards the interior, it is necessary that the weak person be placed on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should place a bandage over the root of the hip, where it is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then he should extend the bandage upwards from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the flank.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong assistant should take his arm, and reduce the large swelling of the hip by gentle means, and extend it to the outer extension with a vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now indeed it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the remaining types of healing, by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If however it is elevated above you, and does not obey you at the entrance with this type of healing entirely: then it is necessary that both feet of the weak person be bound together with a strong bandage, gentle, over both heels, and over both knees: and let the length of each be compared to its own quantity of four fingers: and let the weak leg be extended more by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the weak person should be suspended over a wooden beam, which is in the house: and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong youth to support the head of the hip: and let him be suspended with the weak youth, another: and let another youth push, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with swiftness.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In the reduction of it, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the weakened person lies on a platform, according to what we have described in the case of having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let the ligament be tightened above his leg, weakened as it is, and above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two wooden boards should be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a wooden board should be placed in the middle of the platform, fixed well: on which are wrapped humid cloths, so that it does not hurt the weakened person; and let the board be between his hips, so that he is not pulled down towards the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then everyone assisting should pull to their own side, and the physician makes the reduction with his own hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If it then obeys to reverting, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place on that same platform, and press upon it, as we have said in the case of a hump, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Truly it is necessary that the weakened person lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the weakened person's leg be extended quickly; and it is according to this same narration on the platform: and the physician should place the palm of his right hand on the groin of the weakened person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should compress it with his other hand, and with that compression place it extended downwards towards the knee joint.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the weakened person be extended downwards, and he should be raised above the ground: rather it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary if his joint is dislocated outward, according to what we said about lying on two joints: and it is on his face, and the ligaments are extended: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression with a plate should be administered over the place to which the joint returns, with completion of reduction according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is, that you stretch out two weakened legs; and when you see them as equal, and the weakened one draws in its leg, and expands it without excuse; then you know, because the limb has now returned according to what is necessary; then join the two hips together, and apply a plaster, and bind with a splint, that is, a circular bandage: so that it may not move to any part: and let the weakened one remain quiet for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them as equal in condition, then you know that the dislocation is now firmly set; therefore, remove the weakened one from walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see some softening; then return and apply a plaster to it, and bind it according to your first stricture; and leave it alone for three days as well.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make it walk slowly on both legs for several days, until it is comforted well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Of Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, that is, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forward.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you will notice the weakened one, so that it applies its leg to its hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere to the hip, then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is to make the weakened one sit upright, so that it now stretches out its leg if it can above that, and attaches your back to its face; and put its foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then adhere to its knee with your palms, and place them straight between your fingers over its knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply both your palms to the sides of its knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another assistant stretches out its foot, until its knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres to the hip with gentleness, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply a plaster to it, and make the leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the patient not use it for walking for some days, until it heals.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, the reduction is refused to you, then administer a strong extension with bandages, whose preceding description was given in the treatment of dislocation, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel bone is sometimes removed with a small removal, and sometimes it is dislocated according to its joint.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the ankle bone swollen, proceeding to the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its removal, however, is an easy reduction: and it is that it should be extended with ease by hand, and adjusted, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of it when it is dislocated according to its joint, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright: and another strong assistant should hold it from behind, at the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you should hold with your right hand its foot from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of its ankle at the heel.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left hand and two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then stretch out with the left hand, and press the sole of the foot with the right hand turned towards the knee without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have narrated.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then press the sole of the foot towards the knee in a third position, and you will draw out the shaft.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns to its original position, or to the second according to this method, and you see the foot is equalized, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation over it, for it itself will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however the reduction of it is prohibited to you with what we have narrated: then make the weak part lie on its back on the ground, and fix a small peg firmly in the earth, so that it falls between its hips: and you have now enveloped it with a cloth, so that it does not hurt the weak part.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take its hip: afterwards the assistant stretches out the other foot, either with their hands or with a bandage that binds around the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then the assistant stretches out against the extension of his own comparison: and the small peg stands between the two hips of the weak part, retaining it, so that its body is not drawn downwards at the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor adjusts the dislocation with his hands, and the assistant holds the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with swiftness.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and the health of its reposition is declared to you: then apply an emplaster and a poultice, and bind it firmly with ligaments, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary to beware lest you harm the nerves that are behind the heel, so that the bandage does not press upon them and hurts them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the bandage is softened, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and prohibit the injured person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If indeed he is allowed to walk before that time, there will not be safety lest the dislocation dissolve upon it and become corrupted, and he does not receive a cure afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a hot abscess happens to him: then it is necessary to administer to him the treatment which we previously mentioned in another place in our cure, and embrocation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated be adjusted with a few gentle extensions without effort: and indeed this is not difficult, but rather it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in certain nodes of the back of the foot, then it is necessary that the injured person sit with his foot on a level place on the ground or on a stool, and he stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and put your foot on that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with strength, until it returns to its place, and you will see that it is already adjusted, and does not appear prominent in the location.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the foot a board which grasps the whole foot, having two horns.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and secured from the dislocation.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the types of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens from that and you desire to cure it and its restoration, death often follows; and because of this, it is not suitable to take responsibility for its cure, unless one is skilled in the long-practiced art, merciful, pious, slow, not reckless, nor presumptuous; and so that he may use gentle medicines which only soothe hot abscesses, and leave the injured person to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you despair, or hope for health with gentle treatment of the disease, and in which something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Take care therefore to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the illness, before a hot aposteme occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the limb is restored according to what you wished, then administer a regimen that soothes the aposteme; and treat the wound with what is suitable for it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If there is dislocation with fracture, and it occurs in separated bones of the joint, then take care to ablate them, and do in that what we said in simple diseases from what has preceded in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your virtue, and guard yourself from the entrance into the way of fear: according to what has preceded my prediction to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more healthful to your body among those in your time.
