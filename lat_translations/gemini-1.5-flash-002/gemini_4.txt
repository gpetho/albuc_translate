Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is the last of medical science with its completion, and have reached its end through its expositions and its explanations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Because manual operation has been neglected in our region and in our time, completely forgotten, until perhaps its science perished and its trace was cut off, and there remained of it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered; and error and hesitation have befallen them, until their intentions have been obscured, and their force has been weakened.  It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this treatise according to the way of exposition, explanation, and abbreviation; and that I should come with the forms of cautery instruments and other surgical instruments, when it is done by the addition of explanation and by hastening what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good manual surgeon is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen has related, until he knows the supports of the limbs and their shapes, and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their courses, and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for that reason Hippocrates said that the name is much with the name, and little with the work, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We indeed already said that in the introduction of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Because he who is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy cannot avoid falling into error, by which men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science, and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is, because I saw a foolish physician incise a scrofulous abscess in a woman's neck, and he cut some arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man who was advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore he reached it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Wherefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed I had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and splints with a strong binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he completed it according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he left him for several days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and it remained so until his leg and foot became suppurated, and came to destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	Therefore I was called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and calmness followed, and he escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	Nevertheless, the corruption was already confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore the corruption ceased to spread in the limb, until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician, who perforated a cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated afterwards, until its malignancy was magnified with its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, because when a cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can tolerate having its whole substance cut away.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason, O my son, it is necessary for you to know that manual operation is divided into two divisions: namely, operation associated with safety: and operation with which there is danger in most instances.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already pointed out in every place in this book where an operation occurs which involves terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to avoid that, and to leave it alone, so that fools may not find a way to speak of it and bring dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore take measure with care and caution, and treat your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to salvation and laudable success: and leave alone terrible ailments of difficult healing: and lift your spirits from that which makes you afraid, so that hesitation may not enter into your faith and your well-being.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more conducive to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your rewards.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness: lest you be called bad physicians.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now however I have divided this treatise according to three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Concerning cautery with fire, and cautery with a sharp instrument, chaptered and ordered from head to foot, and the forms of instruments, and the tools of cautery: and everything which is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Concerning incision and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things: and the whole chaptered, ordered with the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of torsion, and similar things: chaptered, ordered from head to foot, and the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.

Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning the benefit and harm of cautery: and to which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its benefits and harms: and in what complexion it should be exhibited.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	Therefore I say that the discussion of the quality of the benefit of cautery, and its harm, is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a science, and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many wise men have also spoken on it, and disagreed: and indeed a little from their discussions suffices me, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	Therefore I say that cautery universally benefits every complexion which is with matter, and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, in the hot and dry complexion with matter they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some have said that cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of that, namely that cautery is not suitable in the illness which is from heat and dryness: because the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness be treated with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the contrary said: that benefit is achieved through cautery in every hot and dry illness which occurs in human bodies: because when you compare a human body and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the human body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say according to his statement: because experiment has already revealed that to me several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not fitting that one undertake this unless one is already proven and experienced in the final chapter of the practice of cautery, and has known the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their duration.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the other complexions, however, there is no fear for you; and especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For indeed all physicians have agreed on them: and they did not disagree on the benefit with cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that from the secret of treatment by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined with it, except with small harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of burning medicines, however, reaches that which is distant from the members: and perhaps it causes an illness difficult to heal in the member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now indeed that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I excuse myself from lengthy speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not that it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would bring to you a hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses with a philosophical demonstrative speech, which would be sharpened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is fitting to perform cauterization, and they put the better time in the spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is suitable at all times: because the harm happening because of time is submerged in the benefit which is drawn with cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if cauterization is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate slowness: because it is feared from them that a greater harm may happen than the small harm entering because of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let not that fall into your minds, O sons, which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely that the illness which is healed by cauterization does not always return: and they posit that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cauterization is nothing but a medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the causes why pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Nevertheless cauterization surpasses medicine in the speed of its healthfulness and the strength of its operation and the vehemence of its mastery: and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the complexion of the infirm, and the location of his illness, and its strength: and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and what arrives at it in its acquisition from foods and similar causes, unless it is an illness in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	An illness subtle in a limb with few superfluities and humors, such as cauterization of a tooth for pain, and things similar to it, it is possible that that pain may not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But truly the speech of the common people again, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is correct speech: not to that which they intend in it: since they believe that there is no cure which can be compared with medicine, nor with anything else after the application of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the matter is contrary to that, and the intention that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is not so, except that when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help: then we administer cauterization at the end of the matter, and it helps: then from that it falls out that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients, however, said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say that, except because of the evenness of gold and the excellence of its substance: and they said that the site of cauterization does not produce pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	That is not true absolutely: because I have now proved it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you cauterize with fire from gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the degree you wish, because of the redness of the gold: and when it is quickly cooled, and if you add more heating to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the craftsman falls into difficulty with it: and because of that, cauterization with iron is quicker and more convenient for us, because of its straightforwardness for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I indeed have now arranged this Chapter on Cauterization according to chapters: and I have arranged them from head to foot: so that they may ease the one seeking what he wishes from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization contributes to the control of moisture and coldness in the brain: which two are the causes of headache, and the abundance of the flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and of drowsiness, and toothache, and sore throat: and universally of every illness which arises from coldness, such as paralysis, headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the patient: that he be purged first with a cleansing purgative medicine for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the patient, and his age, and his custom require.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands squarely, so that he now places his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever therefore your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then heat the olive-shaped cautery; its form is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the place marked with ink, descending, so that your hand is gradually tightened, and you will roll it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift your hand, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see now revealed from the bone the quantity of the head of alkiel, or the quantity of zeuherbi, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat with your hand the same iron, or with another if it cools, until you see the bones which I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and soak the cautery in it, and place it on the place, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place on it the cautery soaked in butter, and leave it on the place until the burn mark is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	Now they have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits; wherefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape away what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to reach the utmost with the cautery, until it makes a strong impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, which is made like the shape of a kirate: or the instrument which women place in the infusion of a small alphabet: and they think that the vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it until it is consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But to me these two types of cautery do not seem at all suitable except in certain men according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with its safety.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity: as we have testified in other members: and especially when the head of the sick person is naturally weak: and indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore operate with it safely.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs in the whole head: and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses leeches, and cuppings, and head purges, and oils, and cataplasms.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things benefits him: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery a little below that one.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it above every horn of his head with a cautery, until the skin is pierced, and a quantity of bone, which we have described, is uncovered.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize him with one cautery in the occiput of his head, in the place which is called the vessel: and it is the place where a cupping glass is placed: and raise your cautery in this, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the sick person finds because of that a very intense pain, and different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I shall call this cauterization in its place: and it is necessary that it be a cauterization, by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its occiput with a finer cautery, than that by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with a burning medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with purifying medicines, and the remaining treatment which I described in the divisions of illnesses is administered, and it does not completely help: then cauterization is used in it according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	Cauterization with a sharp burning medicine, however, is that you take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then incise the place of pain at the time with a wide phlebotom, until a space is made under the skin in which the clove is held.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it under the skin until it is hidden: then bind over it with a suitable constricting pad, and leave it for fifteen hours, then unbind it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterwards put over it lint soaked in butter, until the place forms pus: then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization with iron, however, is in this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	A fire cautery, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a nail, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot and hold your hand; and you slowly revolve the iron with speed; and let the amount that is burned be of the thickness of the skin, about half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand, so that the artery below is not burned and a flow of blood does not occur.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a piece of cloth in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then apply a piece of cloth with butter; afterwards treat with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second knife-like end of the cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an old one.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing an old hemicrania.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a hemicrania with what we have said from the preceding treatment, and what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we said from the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the knife-like cautery until it becomes white after you mark on the place of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or about that: and place your hand at once, and press it until you cut the artery, and reach to the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves in mastication, lest the side be burned, or the nerve which moves it, from which a spasm may result.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be watchful and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its cutting there is danger, and especially to him who is ignorant of what he does, and is not studious, nor experienced: and he leaves the operation with it at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with a recollection of the treatment of the flow of blood happening from an artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	But if you see from the sickness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we have related, treat the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in earache.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is treated with resolvents and the other treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and it is that which is called a point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then prick with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it is rolled; or around both, if pain is in both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And move the cautery away from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with a hot iron: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points in each ear, about like that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in torticollis.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torticollis which is treated with cauterization is only from the types which arise from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization of the type which arises from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of torticollis with bleedings, and purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little lower than its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur except in the part which appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the end of the upper ear, a little below the horn of the head: and another in the temple; the length of which should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, the form of which has been mentioned previously; however, it is not a little thinner than that, as you see: and it is necessary that there be a knife of a little superfluous thickness in it.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with what has preceded until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cautery in the occiput of the head, according to what has preceded: and let the method of cauterization be according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also, cauterization is done with a cautery over the stomach; and this is the most extreme measure.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then let him be treated with what has preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Oblivio.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that in the first instance, great quantities of hyssop and pills purifying the brain be given to the patient to drink.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the patient's entire head, and apply to the back of his head the mustard plaster described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is the method of cauterization: and do it according to the same order which I described there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed by it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make for him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cauterization the breadth of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cauterization, with what preceded.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	But if you wish an addition, and the patient is able to tolerate it: then make for him a cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	But if you wish an addition: then cauterize him above the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him until he is healed: and let the cauterization be oiled according to the form which was set forth.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with hyssop, and with that which we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery above each horn of the head, and with a cautery behind it, and with three above the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if in the illness you need the softening of the body with more of those things, and the infirm person is enduring, and the illness is severe: then cauterize him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery, until a great deal of his skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for him until he is healed: and thus the cautery of Oliuare.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized, unless his epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with purgatives, and with the other treatment which we described in the division: when the patient is strong, or is tolerant in receiving medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if he is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and mouthwashes cleansing the brain are administered, before that for many days, with improvement of diet.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the method: and with another cautery in his occiput, and over every horn of his head with a cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	But if the patient is strong and is tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned in the case of paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	But if the patient is a child, then apply a small cautery, according to this method.

Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we mentioned in the case of paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined towards melancholia, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him something to drink which will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a properly made bandage of linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting squarely should be held on all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is better from old sheep butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a fire with a moderate measured heat, which the finger can tolerate when put into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then empty it onto the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this for the patient once every week, along with his other good regime, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize it making very small points of it, except that you hold your hand with the cautery: indeed, let it be by smelling.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this type of cautery moistens the brain with a quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then place on it a pledget soaked in butter, or chicken fat.

When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and purge the patient with that which cleanses his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And guard him from all dampness, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him on the two temples with two cauteries, if the beginning of the descent of water is in both eyes at once; or on one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the breadth of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	But if you see something of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off of them, and caution from the flow of blood.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in old tears.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old, constant, and are over the veins and arteries which are in the exterior of the head, it is verified that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery that I have narrated in the beginning of the descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need an addition, then cauterize it on every side cautiously of the eye, over the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with what we said in the division, and the medication does not help: then hurry, and give the patient  infirmocochia for three nights; then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery.

Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not move your hand with the cautery, but according to the quantity that burns a third of the eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of lunar cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted, pricking the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	Cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In cauterization with fire, however, instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who cleanse them, until they are lengthened and made even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if they prick him at their root, then bind his eyes with a headband so that they do not move until they grow.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they have grown and are even, then place the patient's head in your bosom; then mark upon the eyelid of his eyes with a cautery iron, a mark which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a pledget soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage upon the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then heat the cautery iron, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape which you marked little by little in many times, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is wholly burnt properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contract, and the hairs rise up at the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place a pledget with butter on it, until the eschar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if some of the hairs return after a while, and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cauterization on that place, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	But if the hairs are below, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is level so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is to instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from paper or cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, one ounce of each or thereabouts; then grind them together well and quickly, so that it does not grow cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread some of it on the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a pledget soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be in your bosom.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move it whenever the patient feels the medicine biting; for its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore he feels this biting, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid rise, as it rises with burning, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then apply more of the medicine to the place where the medicine does not press down and does not darken, until your operation is even, and the eye is contracted.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place a pledget with butter on it, until the burnt skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diaphnicum ointment, or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you in the operation that you observe the utmost care, lest anything of the medicine fall into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if the eyelid softens afterwards, and something fights from the hairs in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the way of rectitude is not hidden from him who studies this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a lachrymal fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom, and let a servant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it does not move or be shaken.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a pledget soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage over his eye; then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's quill from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to be penetrating to the other end, and if you wish it to be upward, try thus.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then press the fistula, if it is open, and draw out the pus from it, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it, and draw out its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with it a little near the cautery from the eye, to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not err, or the sick man is disturbed: and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you arrive at the bone with the beginning of your cautery, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not, then repeat the cautery once, or twice, if you need it: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then apply a pledget with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	But if forty days have passed, and it is not healed: then apply a sharp corrosive medicine to it, until the bone is exposed: and scrape it according to what has come in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the ancients mentioned.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Apply to the place of the fistula, and incise it: then place in the incision a thin tube, that is, a thin cannula, whose shape is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of molten lead, and hold your hand with good retention of the cannula, and let the patient not move at all, lest the molten lead run, or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place over the eye of the patient a compress soaked in egg white, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For the lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed with what we have said, by cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to treat the opening of the nose, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what will come to its own proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing fissures of the lips.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Fissures, which are called chaps, often occur on the lip, and especially on the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you treat these fissures with what we have said in the division of illnesses, and the treatment does not help, then prepare a small, knife-shaped cautery iron, according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then quickly apply the heated iron to the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with cerate until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	Concerning the method of cauterizing an oral fistula.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, then it forms pus and bursts; afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize with fire according to the amount it occupies in the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterwards with what we have said concerning treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the pus is cut away and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come into its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the gums and softened teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum is softened because of humors, and the teeth are loosened, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then a fire cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place a cannula upon the tooth: and quickly insert the ignited cautery into it: and hold your hand a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to what you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the loosened tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt humor is dried.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Concerning the method of cauterizing for toothache.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or a worm in the tooth, and treatment with medicines is of no help: then cautery is used in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	Now cautery with butter is as follows: take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a pan.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a tent and wrap it around the end of a probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then dip it in the boiling butter: and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat this several times, until the power of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, dip wool or a tent in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; and place a red-hot iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	Now cauterization with fire is as follows: take a bronze tube or an iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something in its body of some thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then heat the cautery, whatever shape it may be: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary in the impression of that cautery, that the patient fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for one hour: then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever end you wish, as far as possible: and this is the shape of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in strumae.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When strumae are from phlegm and from cold humors, and they are not obedient to digestion through medicines, and you wish to digest them quickly: then a concave cautery of fire, whose shape is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that smoke may exit from the cautery at the other end: and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time if it needs it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	But if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place upon it lint infused in butter, until what the fire burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with tooth unguent, until it heals in the form of a small tube.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	Concerning the method of cauterization in hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When humors overcome the lung passage, and especially when it is with coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated first with solutive medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it in the uvula at the root of the throat in a depressed place: and beware lest you reach with the cautery to the throat, nor into the skin, except a little of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the juncture of the neck in the last vertebra of it, finally: and let the cautery be nail-shaped according to the manner which preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which preceded, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in diseases of the lung and cough.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the infirm person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the disease is of long standing: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the clavicle in depressed, soft, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be a cannula according to the form which preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, which is called Punctum, whose form preceded in the puncturing of earache: and let the points be from thirty points up to about others.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore the cauterization is alleviated with it, when you do with it at once three cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the armpit, in dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated because of humors, and it is not fixed in the hour of its return from its dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient is laid supine on his back, or on his healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin which is in the inner armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then have a cautery with two points.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three points, wherefore the figure of the cauterization then becomes six cauteries: and the points are according to the thinness of the probe.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of a cautery having three points.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added in this way, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place crushed leeks with salt on the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the patient adhere to stillness, so that the limb is not moved for some time, until it is strengthened.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries puncturing.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, until they draw it from its complexion, and catarrhs multiply in it, and continuous methods of treatment do not help: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the breastbone the size of one finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on the two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And space them so that they do not join, when they produce pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery with which this cauterization is done be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for him who is frightened by this cautery: and it is so that you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity which you wish with a branding iron: then cauterize it with a pointed cautery: then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and dampness, or from gross flatulence, until it departs from its natural complexion by superfluous departure, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the patient be laid supine upon his neck, and you mark with a branding iron three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity upon the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the man's elbow arrives: and let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight body: and do not press your hand with the cautery very much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of what is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, a quantity of half of it not added: and let the patient be standing on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him be lying, who now extends his legs, and raises his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-cautery, when you have skill and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And beware that you do not proceed excessively in cauterization, and burn the whole thickness of the skin, wherefore the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an exit wound occurs, and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient suffers pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, the pain is accompanied by intense sharpness: and you see now, that its treatment has fatigued the physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, it is necessary that the patient lie on his back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then mark the location of the abscess with a cautery; then heat a cautery iron which resembles a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it a single cautery, until the whole skin is burned, and it reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out: then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary to use this type of cautery, except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hands these illnesses occur with some experience: then indeed let him dare this operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But indeed, to leave it alone is better in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said, cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you should take of the dried roots of birthwort, one longer root which is found among them, and let it be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil and ignite it in the fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the clavicle with the neck, and with two small cauteries somewhat obliquely downwards towards the part which is under the chin.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib, somewhat obliquely towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, lower than the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be apparent on the skin by smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And now some ancients have said that there are some men who use a cautery of iron similar to a ray: and they ignite it, and internally insert it into that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess with it, and pus comes out: as we said in the abscess of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII. On the method of cauterizing the spleen.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat a disease of the spleen, with that which we have said of treatment in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then cautery in it is according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is, that you make three cauteries, or four, lining up along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the liver cauteries, the figure of which preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each cautery the quantity of the thickness of a finger, or a little more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cautery be, as we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie supine on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: that you ignite a cautery having two prongs, which we spoke of in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and lift the skin which is in the direction of the spleen, where the left elbow of the patient arrives: and let your lifting of the skin be according to the breadth of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them: then withdraw the cautery: therefore four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care of the cautery after you dismiss it, that it discharges pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than the other things which preceded from the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	Cautery does not fall in dropsy, except for ascites properly so-called.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery over the stomach, and another cautery over the liver, and a cautery over the spleen, and two cauteries on the back between the vertebrae, and one in the region of the chest, and another in the region of the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be approximately the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open, so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the patient from treatment after cauterization: for it is necessary that two intentions be combined in him; and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, according to what preceded concerning its shape; and that with which the back is cauterized, should be olive-shaped, according to what preceded concerning its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When abscesses form in a dropsical patient and are filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize above the dorsum of the foot in the hollow which is between the little and ring fingers; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	Then the yellowish water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each of the two legs, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another below that, about the middle of the leg: and on each hip two cauteries: and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may sweat out from it; then treat it with the other things which we have mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Concerning the method of cauterization in looseness of the bowels.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and humors, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated with methods of treatment, and it is not healed, and you see the patient tolerating cauterization of exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, as preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a thin nail-like cautery: and a large cautery, or two cauteries, over the alcatin above the alhosos.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see exuberant humors, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery over the pubis, and a cautery over each ilium: and perhaps you will add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Concerning the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupt humors, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower vertebra of the back under the almeidati somewhat triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel as if with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming inflamed, then cauterize him above the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and cauterize above his liver, and another above his spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut away althelul, then heat a cautery that resembles a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert it, burning, into the excised althelul: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have related.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with that which benefits them of ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more effective in helping.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the incision and the operation which we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he may be healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	Therefore, when a fistula occurs in someone, and it becomes old, pus and corrupt humors flow from it.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, it is more fitting that you should probe it with a slender probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then learn the amount of its depth with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then heat a cautery which is similar to a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula and the amount in which the nail entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount of your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning a nerve, if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all those places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then treat the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time: then know that it is now completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if materials are not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in its depth there is a corrupt bone, or something like that from those: the mention of which will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from thick wind, and the strength of the sick person is diminished because of it, then it is necessary that you cauterize it above the almethen above the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over each kidney with a nail-shaped cautery, the mention of which has preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the almeidatu itself.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore three lines will result.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore the last ones will be more helpful.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and dampness, until the patient no longer retains urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the pubis above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and with a cautery on the right side of the pubis, and another on the left: and let the length of that lateral cauterization be according to the size of the finger joint: and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or two cauteries, if you need it: and let it be according to the preceding cautery with a nail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and dampness occur in the womb, and it is prevented by that from impregnation, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the pubis in the lower back, or two cauteries: and let the cautery be with a nail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucous humors are poured out to the socket of the hip, and they become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that the leg is lengthened over the other, when they are compared together: and the place of dislocation is found empty in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the patient above the socket of his hip with a cautery similar to a circle: after you mark with a hot iron around the socket, as it is revolved: and that the socket itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the form which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	But if this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of all the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip joint, and the cause of this is cold and dampness: and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary to purge the patient of gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is to cauterize above the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good, or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space which is between each cautery be the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes however the cautery is made in the middle above the head of the hip joint itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, the form of which preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, with one: so that it may be a circle containing the whole hip.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, on the place to which the sick person points there, in which there is pain, and with your cautery on the calf four fingers towards the outside a little: and let the cautery be knife-shaped.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	But if the sick person indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a pointed cautery, with three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-shaped cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterization, that you do not go so far with the cautery as to burn a nerve, or a large artery, and thereby draw upon the sick person great harm, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I indeed have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in cauterization, and the leg swelled, until the swelling reached the foot, and it was entirely perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then there followed a discharge of the bowels, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	But if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men have said, in the cauterization of the hip, of which this is the method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar iron cautery, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its orifice according to the thickness of a date-stone, or somewhat less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space which is between each cautery be the amount of a thumb-joint: and let the cauteries be open on two sides: and let their height be about a joint, or two joints: and make for them a handle of iron decently fitted to the cauteries.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the hip-socket, the patient lying on his healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, "My son, we have used this type of cautery little, because of the terror of its appearance: and because we have found few who would endure it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is among the good cauteries for him who endures it, and finds with it its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	Now the cautery with burning medicines is such that you make two samia having a perforated ring, into which descends a hinge of its door of bronze or iron, the length of the wall; in the height of which are two nodes, or something like them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space which is between both be the amount of the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above; and let that which contains itself towards each other be according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it over the hip joint, the patient lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand very much upon the hip joint.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles warm water which has been heated a little with fire, and hold it for the amount of an hour; and let the patient endure its biting and burning, for he will find the biting like fire, until the biting rests.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the whole hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for a few days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the ultimate aid.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	But if the pain extends to the hip or leg: make him sit in what contains water, as you did with the hip equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unslaked lime, one part of each; grind both, and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which is perforated with one small hole, according to the size that the ray enters; and place under the bottom of the pot another glass pot; and pour over the alkali and lime fresh water, which submerges both by a finger’s breadth: after which you compress them with your hand with good pressure; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water, and pour it over more lime; and filter until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among medicines are those with which ankles are cauterized, also such as tesisie, and cashew nut honey, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed, in narrating, recounted the treatment of a certain man from antiquity, by which he was cured of hip pain and sciatica; and he magnified it to be very good.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that he did not need another treatment, and that he was healed in one turn, until he recounted that he perhaps entered a bath carried, and came out of it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is so that it is taken from green setaragi; and if green is not found, let dry, fresh be taken; and let it be rubbed much with some fat, and let it be placed on the hip where there is pain, or leg, or in the hip joint; and let it be bound, and let it be left for the amount of three hours, or for the amount that the infirm person feels a lessening of the burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes dewy, introduce him into the bath-chair.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes, and it is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not fitting that anyone use a cautery with these medicines, except after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides also said that goat dung, when the sciatic vein is cauterized with it, benefits it: and the cautery is done in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let wool be taken, and let it be soaked in old oil, and let it be placed upon the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle bone, and is closer to the ankle bone.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat it.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore do not cease doing this until sensation reaches the middle as far as the ankle, and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called the Vaccine cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter; and cauterization is not suitable except in this type alone, which occurs from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after evacuating the patient with foul-smelling pills and the like, three lines should be made on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the almond, after marking with ink five cauteries or more in each line, according to the amount that comes from the patient's tolerance and strength: and the cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a nail-shaped cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in incipient gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often happens to small infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you will find in the last vertebra of the back and its nodes that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you see it and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular in this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery take hold of every part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, [make] two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it heals with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware lest you apply the cautery to a hump which is formed in a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in gout and the pains of the joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of the joints are from cold humors which are poured out into any member of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name it gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of healing, and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is so that one cauterizes him after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose form is this.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	But if the pains ascend to the knees, or the other joints, and this happens many times, then cauterize it above each knee with three cauteries, or four on every side, with this same clavus-shaped cautery.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If, however, more are necessary with this cautery, then cauterize him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend to the knees and the back, then administer what we said of cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	But if the pains are only in the hands, then puncture around the wrists, as if two lines are rolled around.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, a point above every node, and above the ridge of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not deprive the patient of good regimen, of the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good regimen is done, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with God's help with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and it is beginning to be near: then it is necessary that you order the patient to omit eating on his day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And that he use lenitives, so that stool descends from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath, until the bladder or intestine emerges or appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a cautery under the rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then heat the cautery, which is of this form, until it becomes white and throws off sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then return the intestine or bladder to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the assistant place his hand on the place, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the legs of the patient, and placed a cushion under him, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on the mark, your hand with the cautery standing straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you reach the bone with it; or repeat with it another time if you have not reached the bone with it on the first attempt.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and there results from it for the patient either death or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be thin, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with other ointments until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you provide his nourishment for the length of time of his treatment, which softens his bowels: so that the intestine does not come out during straining and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it on for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him be lessened from labor, and from fullness of food and drink, and from loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regime, thus he is healed with a complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will describe the treatment of ruptures with incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	But when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize his rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be as one-third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some earlier ones have said: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with a hot iron, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help it: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery of every limb be according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it heals from the first cauterization, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat the cauterization on it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because it is customary for these pains to move from one limb to that which is near it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary that you pursue them with cautery, until the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Lepers, moreover, are sometimes aided by cautery with the greatest benefit.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy which arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when you wish to cauterize it, consider.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is incipient, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it does not descend, nor stand still: and you fear for the patient, that corruption will seize upon his whole constitution: then cauterize him upon the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, noticeably, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two upon the two temples, and one behind upon the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And lastly apply your hand with the cautery lightly, until it imprints a small mark upon it, and the scabs are loosened from it: so that the exhalation of gross vapors from it may be relieved, and cauterize also with a cautery upon the spleen itself, as has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head, and with a cautery upon the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries upon the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries upon the vertebrae of the neck, and six upon the vertebrae of the back, and one large one upon the haunch near the coccyx and one above it, in the almeidati: and two upon the hips: namely upon each hip one, and two upon the knees: one upon each knee, and two upon the shoulders, and two upon the elbows, and two upon the tenderness of his chest: and cauterize him upon every joint, of the joints of his fingers and toes: and cauterize upon every heel of his feet, and the wrists of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves which are upon the back of the heel, lest you burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery upon the pubic bone, and another upon the stomach, and another upon the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add cautery, the more is the help, and the more beneficial.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the patient does not find pain in cautery, as healthy people find it: because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of size and smallness according to the limbs and joints: according to what preceded in the kinds of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the cauteries with the flour of herbs with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in numbness.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to what the size or smallness of the limb deserves.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes cauterization is done for some numbness which happens in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	Truly, let no one presume upon this except he who is wise in the anatomy of the limbs, and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When the albaras becomes chronic, and nothing from the arts of medicine benefits it: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery a little, according to the amount of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the flour of the herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: of each let there be one part; let all these be mixed, and spread upon a cloth, and applied to the place, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When the cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it is rolled up.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The wise, however, have said that it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But it does not seem so to me; because I fear that it will ulcerate; and I have already seen that happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said; or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an adubelati, and it is slow in maturing, either because of the superfluity causing it, or because of the age of the patient, when he is decrepit and has little blood, or because of the time, and one wishes to hasten the maturation of the adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it itself will hasten with maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you wish its perforation with a cautery, then a fire cautery, whose form is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the diseased, so that the flow of pus may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corroding ulcer.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corroding ulcer is nothing but a corruption in a limb that moves, and corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	Therefore if you see a corroding ulcer in a place that will tolerate cauterization with fire, then have many fire cauteries, small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place where the corroding ulcer is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every part until you eradicate the whole corruption, and nothing at all of it remains.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and apply crushed sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas, until all the eschars and all the corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	Therefore if you see that after three days flesh grows in a healthy growth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And a corrosive is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it arises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is of quicker help: and indeed I have already spoken of its cauterization with a sharp medicine in the division: therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in nails and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Often this sickness happens in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered thing which harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed cautery in them is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for that with fire, make a concave fire cautery similar to a vulture's feather: which is made from iron, according to the quantity which contains the nail on every side: and let it be of thin edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it, ignited, upon the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then roll the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then plaster it with wild mallows, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster upon it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it itself will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with a flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	But if they are not inverted, and happen many times on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply a cautery to them with warm water: and it is so that you take a small tube of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather: and place it over the nail, or wart.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw into the tube a small quantity of warm water: hold your hand, and you revolve it with a slight compression of your hand, so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the nail, and the warm water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait a little for the biting of the warm water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it, for the nail is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with them one after another, until you come to all of them that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When tremor happens to someone from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five, upon the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and upon his stomach a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor rests with olive cautery, and the health of a cold illness hastens.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul things are expelled in the body, that is, pustules, which are made from gross corrupt matters.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary that they be cauterized on every head of the pustule with a fine cautery with myrtle wood, whose end is lit with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long birthwort.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized immediately, at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner: and they do not increase; and the superfluity making them is broken, and is healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that it be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Very often there occurs a flow of blood from an artery which is cut in a wound, which happens externally, or in the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to cut it off.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it: and press it firmly until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing comes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put in the fire small olive-oil cauteries, and many large ones; and blow upon them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place in which the artery is broken, and place the cautery upon the vein, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	But if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not cease doing this with one after another until the bleeding stops.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware lest you burn the nerve which is there, and another harm befall the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the bleeding is stopped.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicines with the property of staunching blood are placed upon it, and it is bound with a suitable compress.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But he who manages its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or the application of cauterizing agents, and the like, does not completely benefit him, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if this should happen to someone, and a physician or medicine is not present, then he should begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have described, and constricting it strongly, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not removed, pouring cold water of intense coldness constantly over it, until the blood clots and thickens, and is excised.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile he should consider what he needs from a cautery or from medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	Concerning Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the first chapter, every illness in which a cautery with fire and burning medicine is suitable, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed chapters there from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that what is sought may be lightened for the seeker.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, O sons, that in this chapter is, from the terror, that which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that it is necessary that caution be more vehement in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood often falls, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of an exit, or cure of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death falls upon many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that fall upon you in which there is hesitation, for sometimes there fall to you in this art kinds of men with kinds of infirmities.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them is he who is angered by his illness, and death is light to him: because of the vehemence of what he finds from his illness and the length of its malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness is from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is he who gives his wealth, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is pernicious.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more vehement than your greed and your rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything of it, except after certain knowledge, which verifies with you that to which a laudable outcome arrives.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the treatment of all your sick, prognosis and indication of that to which health is suitably directed.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that is for you help in the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you direction and inspiration: because that is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: that the thing which you wish from it, and of which you have need, may be lightened for you.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Concerning the treatment of water which gathers in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this infirmity very often happens to children at birth; or when the midwife constricts the child's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed I have not seen this sickness in others than in children: and death has hastened to all whom I have seen of them; therefore it seemed to me to omit an operation in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until it could not sit upright because of the size of its head: and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed, either gathers between the skin and the bone; or gathers under the bone upon the dura mater.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with one cut in width: and let the length of the incision be about two fingerbreadths, until the moisture flows out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of the spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head opened on every side: and the water is depressed when you compress it with your hand inwards, and that is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the incisions with cloths and powders.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then moisten it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the binding, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not allow the head to be bound equally.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the patient all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is that you consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes it is greater in the occiput, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear to you: and incise it as much as is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe that you do not cut an artery, and that a flow of blood occurs, and that the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of the moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When catarrhs happen to someone in the eyes, or in the chest, and it becomes chronic, and the treatment of medicines does not help: then the final treatment in this is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you wish to incise them, it is necessary that the patient shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the patient bind his neck with any cloth of his.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulsates.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both are the depressed places which are behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in certain men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a cautery on each side: and incise each with a sharp spatula on both sides, the incision reaching to the bone: and let this be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce the spatula under the artery, and incise it upwards with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is incised, blood flows out with a pulsatile flow, which leaps inwards with a frequent leap.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with cautery, and incise to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which it is necessary to let out of blood, is six ounces and perhaps you let out more, or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All that according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the infirm and the fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if something of the sifac remains at the bone, then incise it, lest a hot abscess occur: then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man suffers from chronic headache, or acute catarrh due to acrid humors and heat in the temples, or chronic headache and similar conditions, and he is treated with medical remedies and they do not help, then we have found in these illnesses that extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have described, is effective.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operating in their extraction is that the patient should shave the hairs which are in the temples, and direct [the attention] to the artery appearing in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it is shown to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few men, or by the intensity of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	But if it is hidden from you, then let the patient bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or steam the place with hot water, until it appears to you in manifest appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a spatula, which I formed a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw a hook into it, and draw it upwards, until you draw it out of the skin, and make it escape from the tunics which are beneath it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	But if the artery is thin: then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it a part according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and that no flow of blood occurs.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not rise completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from the blood about six ounces, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if the artery is large: then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with double thread, strong, of silk or of alhod cords, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the healing of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, with a knife-cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better operation, unless the patient has a fever, or is of a heated complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because cautery is among those things which help to end humidities.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of arteries that the place be filled with old cotton; and that properly made pledgets be placed upon it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after dissolution it should be treated with dry medicines which cause flesh to grow, and with linen cloths, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi; and bind your hand until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	But if none of these things is present to you, then place your finger on the place until the blood clots.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness ceases, and bind it as is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And of what is lighter and easier to extract from an artery, it is that you cauterize a vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are of much less sharpness than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like two knives, cold hastens to both: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this therefore the work is better than all work, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space which is between the two knives be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with a branding iron: and place both very hot, until they arrive at the mouth, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities is lengthened.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Concerning the care of sharp, constant flow of tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are constant tears, and their flow is from the veins which are on the outside of the skull, and nothing of medicinal cures helps with them, and you see the face of the sick person already reddened, and he feels a crawling on his forehead, like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are thinned, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded with corrosion, and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears; then the ancients needed in their cure this operation, and they named it a cure with the Knife.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is so that you should instruct the sick person to shave the hairs which are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then incise three equidistant fissures on the forehead according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of the fissure be about two fingers, and one fissure be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the muscles, and the third from the other side; and beware of cutting the arteries which are on the two sides; and lengthen your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of each incision be the amount of three joined fingers; and have a prepared piece of sponge, or much dried cloth, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which the following is soon the form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is from the side of the temples, up to the second incision; and scrape with it all the skin which is between the two incisions, with the sifac which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do that also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues to that which appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, press out the places with clots of congealed blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put into each fissure a pledget of old linen, and place over them pledgets soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, loosen the ligature, and administer a plentiful infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs in the eyes from the interior of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When sharp, acrid, persistent catarrhs affect someone, and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their sight already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is sharp, intense pain deep in the head, and sneezing follows: then understand from these occurrences that those materials and catarrhs do not come except from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you order the patient to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to one side, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision go to the bone: and keep your hand away from the temporal muscles which move during mastication: until the bone is uncovered: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with old linen or linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind it above with pledgets: and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you unbind it, and you see that the hot abscess is now diminishing: then you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of resin: and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Whatever falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water and vinegar, and things similar to them; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone, or a kind of stone from those which are not added to, nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then instill into the ear something of perfumed oil, or sesame oil.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then manage its extraction, and make him sneeze with sneezing powders, and close the nostrils at the coming of the sneezing, after you place around the ear pieces of cloth, or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For very often it comes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not come out, then manage its extraction with forceps, that is, with fine tweezers: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out with forceps, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then manage its extraction with a small, thin, blunt hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not come out by that, then make a cannula of bronze, and insert the end of the cannula into the hole of the ear deeply, and plug what is around the cannula with wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for the wind except through the cannula: then extract it with your strong suction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For very often it comes out with what we have narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not come out in this way: then take some helkalimbat, or some birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a moderate amount: and place it on the end of a rod after you have neatly wrapped cotton around it: then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incise, before a hot abscess or a spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of incision is that the phlebotomist first bleeds the patient in the cephalic vein: and draw from him blood according to his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fat in the depressed place: and let the incision be of a lunar shape, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever is possible for you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew up the incision at your leisure with speed, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	But if the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains which grow and swell, then manage its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you to exit, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And manage with it the excision of that kind of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do that when you think that that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with a subtle forceps, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water however which enters the ear, it is necessary that the infirm person use sneezing with the head held back first: and he has already filled his ear with a little old cheese: and is lying on that ear in which is the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it exits through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire a little, and let the infirm person introduce one of them into the hole of his ear: and let him jump on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore let him not cease doing that with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water exits so, that you take from a pyre, or from a rush one, and introduce one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burnt.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat another rush, and do this many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a tube as was previously described for the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction however of an animal entering into it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of a large body, which is apparent to the senses: then manage its extraction with forceps and hooks: and its matter is easier than all things which are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction however of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise of distillations, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something of worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the form, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate: then suck with it with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to come out, then seal around the edge of the cannula with wax, as I said in the case of a stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	And if they do not come out with what we have said, then administer distillations which the ancients have already tested in the killing of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring out of oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, with a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Therefore let that which pushes what is in the concavity of the cannula be made neatly of bronze.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a radius and wrap cotton around its end neatly; then pour oil or juice or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the radius with the cotton from above, and press it with your hand with moderate compression until the oil is impelled into the concavity of the hearing, and the sick person feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear should already have been heated a little with fire; and beware that the thing which is distilled into it is not very cold, for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Concerning the treatment of blockage happening in the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants come forth from the wombs of their mothers imperforate.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some people that there is a blockage in the passage of the ear from a wound, or from flesh growing there.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this blockage sometimes occurs in the depth of the opening of the ear, which sight does not reach; and sometimes it happens at the exterior of the opening a little, and sight reaches it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore that which happens in the depth of the ear, and which sight does not comprehend, is in most instances difficult of healing.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which sight reaches, it is necessary that you place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look into it: then if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a thin spatula, whose form is that which follows, let its extremity in which there is a certain small width, a certain part of which is sharp: and let the rest of the spatula be of two smooth sides: so that it does not injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the blockage is from flesh grown in the passage of the ear: then hold it with a thin hook, and cut it with strong ease, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	But if the blockage is in the depth of the ear: then take a thin, smooth probe, and heat it slightly with fire: then insert it into the passage of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel the blockage with it, which the sick person finds with difficulty of hearing, attempt its opening with ease: and beware lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a pledget according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a pledget, and soak it in rose water, and powder over it crushed vitriol, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	But if you see the ear already festering: then it is necessary that you remove the pledget, and leave it with another pledget, which you will wrap in cerate which is made with rose oil, until the warm abscess subsides: then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if bleeding should occur: then submerge a sponge, or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear: and use the remaining treatment, which stops the flow of blood, described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of a stye on the eyelid.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	Those styes which occur on the eyelids of the eye, are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore it is necessary to grasp them with forceps: or with a hook, and to cut them out with a spatula from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place pounded vitriol on the area.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For often they return when something remains of their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Concerning the treatment of the eyelids' hailstone.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Very often something happens in the eyelids which is similar to hail in its strength and hardness, and because of that it is called hailstone: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore, the operation in them is that you consider then, if it is a hailstone proceeding in that which appears of the eyelid, and they are moved to every part, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore find a fissure upon it lengthwise.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then flay it from every side easily until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if its excision is not prepared for you except after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision a little, then that harms the patient in something.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the fissure is large, then unite it with a suture and treat it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and fills it with flesh.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the hailstone slopes towards the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then invert the eyelid and suspend the hailstone with a hook, except that you need an incision, and press it on all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, it will not harm in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the hailstone with salt water, and treat the place with that which produces flesh, until the sick person is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of the axirnath of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is fat which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid; and it happens most to boys; and it weighs down their eyes, and catarrhs happen to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them; and therefore you see them lying down on their faces always, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, which swelling has now covered; and the prominence of the axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is that the sick person puts his head in your bosom.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth, and prepare a pledget in it, and make from that pledget a circle according to the quantity that contains the axirnath on every side.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on every side, so that the axirnath may collect in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then make a cut in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, making incisions across, and let not the incision be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you cut the whole skin until you arrive at the axirnath; for in many dispositions the axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore draw it out with the cloth which you have infiltrated between your fingers to the exterior: and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed: and beware lest you add to the incision, so that you do not arrive with the lancet to the eye, and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if the axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, add a little to the incision easily, until the axirnath comes forth.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then draw it out, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then submerge cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and bind it with powders.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And some men grind salt and put it in the hollow of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture may be liquefied.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if it happens in a place of a hot abscess, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the ways of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whence it happens that it is wrinkled as it ought not to be.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When superfluous hairs are born in the eyelids besides the course of the natural hairs, and grow old: then they harm the eye, and cause various sicknesses, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and albugo, until it becomes a cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed cured according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was premised in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by tubes, according to what I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle into it, in which is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with the thread penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a probe.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid below the added hairs with a spatula, falling from the larger lachrymal [gland] to the smaller lachrymal [gland].
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the thread, and place a small pledget of cotton or cloth under the eyelid: then mark above the eyelid with cautery, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the shape is made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: because this varies in men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there is one who needs a large amount to be incised from the eyelid, according to the amount which is softened from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with a spatula incise upon the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger lachrymal [gland] to the smaller lachrymal [gland], and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, such as is the thickness of a ray.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce a hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then flay it completely.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then join together the two lips with a suture, with a needle and fine woolen thread: and wipe away the blood, and make adhere that which superfluously protrudes from the threads over the two eyebrows, with certain sticking substances, if you wish to do it: and if not, do not worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days: afterwards treat it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the closure of the wound and its joining: but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancients taught this method of treatment, Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	Nevertheless, there is concern about the patient, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is also in Ataxmir: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, separate or joined, according to this form which follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with evenness of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold a hook, and it is not equal: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the greater lachrymal, and a second thread near the lesser lachrymal: and bring together between your fingers the threads with evenness.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with an even elevation: and raise the skin on which the mark has been made, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and care for it, until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if an abscess should occur at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with cerate, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that their hairs are turned.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore it is necessary that you use what we said in the incision: but suture is more skillful for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you turn back the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have related.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two canes, or two slender pieces of wood: whose length shall be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width shall be less than the width of a spatula: and you have already incised at the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then carefully apply each over that which is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the two canes from both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the constricted skin will die, and will blacken, and will putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it is delayed, then incise it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two tubes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Concerning the elevation of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this is, that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you bring together its ends, and tie each with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then place in Alinxotati another fine thread under it shortly, and knot its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the patient place his head in your bosom, and be near the sun so that the operation may be clear: because it is a subtle, or minute, operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up above the Alinxotati: and insert into the Alinxotati that hair: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the Alinxotati is pulled, and the hair does not come out with it: you will pull the Alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you have placed in it, until the Alinxotati comes out from the upper hole, and you see it with the sight of the eye: then indeed you will pull the Alinxotati and the thread: and pull out both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and it will be lifted with it; or leave it, until it lengthens after a time, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the care of the Alxatrati which happens in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental therefore happens from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation in it is that you split that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and you place between them a pledget of linen, and you bind it, until it is healed.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things which dry and constrict; for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek: and embrocate with water in which althea, linseed, and diachylon ointment has been boiled, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap with it a pledget, and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all your ingenuity that it not consolidate, according to the form which it was at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this indeed operation which we have spoken of, is nothing but a certain rectification of Alxatrati, that the form of the place not return completely to what it was.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs below, is that which is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one arises from a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you insert it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lachrymal to the right lachrymal, until the thread arrives at the two extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and incise it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it ought, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a radius, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is made from them: until when they are joined their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with a wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, of softening medicines and linen cloths, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an abscess occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a linen cloth, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the discussion about the treatment of an abscess, when it is above or below, is that the operation proceeds in it according to how the abscess is prepared.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is of many diversities in form: and the skillful surgeon prepares the method with whatever way is possible for him, until he restores the form to its natural form, or near it, and the patient himself, according to what is suitable for him from the operation and instruments in many situations.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of a probe under the eyelid and lift it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not have the sharpness of cutting spatulas, but rather be somewhat blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed and injures the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you are scraping away that adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the whole adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with water: or instill into it from a sieve made from ziniar dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid and eye with a linen cloth: and place on the eye wool infused with egg white: and after the third day use a sieve, and with solidifying agents, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominence of flesh of the tear ducts.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is according to two methods.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is sinewy: and is similar to hard, thin parchment.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not sinewy, similar to congealed white moisture: which when iron touches it, or you try to seize it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not fix itself in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types do not begin except from the greater lachrymal [duct], until it gradually goes, until it covers the vision, and prevents light and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating in its incision is: that the sick person puts his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the growth with a hook of little doubling, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, or an ox, or a cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the growth: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the growth with thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the growth which follows the pupil, as if you were scraping it with the hair to its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that a constant flow of tears may not result from its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the growth is extended with a hook alone: or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it with a smooth spatula, whose form is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware lest the spatula touch the corneal tunic, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, throw into the eye something of crushed salt, or of a powder made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is appropriate, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	But if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is treated many times with medicines, and is healed as I have narrated in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	But if you wish to incise it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a thin, smooth spatula, of weak sharpness, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the nail from above with reason and subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	But if you see that it is rarefied and broken, and the shaving impresses upon it, then distil from your hour into the eye some eye-salve made from zinc, or from red eye-salve, or crushed salt: and cover the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation on it, until the whole of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a warm abscess in the eye contrary to this: for then leave it, and treat the abscess until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with reason, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	But the eminence of the lachrymal flesh, if it harms the eye with great harm, should be suspended with a hook, and a part of it incised: and do not extend the incision, lest the flow of tears be impeded.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then drop into the lachrymal duct red  eye salve, or that made from  verdigris, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and the flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes a red, fleshy growth is born in the eyes of men, either superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a wild rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation in it is also, that the infirm one puts his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with hooks suitable for it: and hold it with one forceps, or a pair.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then incise the flesh first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, lest you injure it during the operation: and let your incision be that with which you incise it, either with a spatula, which we have described in the incision of the nail: or with small scissors, with which the asebel is collected, according to what its form will become after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your incision is completed, and all the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or instill into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines: and place over the eye externally cotton with egg white: so that it may be protected from hot inflammation.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	But if some of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear hot inflammation: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which soothes inflammation.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with the added flesh which occurs in the eye from this type.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you avoid treating any weak eye, from a natural or accidental cause, by operating with iron: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations, until you see that the member is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Concerning the removal of a cataract from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Cataracts are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent the sight from performing its function: and they weaken the eye with the passage of time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which is the cataract is strong, and there is no illness in it other than the cataract: then remove its cataract.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is so that you instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be a thin double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks joined in one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with fine scissors skillfully, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are resolved: and beware lest you injure the eye with the ends of the spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at midday in front of the sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red vitriol: so that by its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the sebum.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if it is not possible for you to collect all of it at that time, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days, until its pain is settled: and it is secured from a hot abscess: then repeat on it in the same way, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the shape of the scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Concerning the reduction of the Arissati to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians name Arissati a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to what its description preceded.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not healed, then there is no skill in it: except that you should incise above the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is uncovered.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is uncovered, and you see in it corruption, or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is named the rough head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of untempered iron, and let its head be round like an awl, which should be pointed with the point of a file, or the point of an aliskilfer with a fine point: and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that that corruption is now scraped: and do that several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with drying styptic medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not fester, and no accident happens in it: then know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is nothing in it but to reduce the fistula to the hole of the nose, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you uncover from the second bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone is uncovered, then take a trepan according to this form, let its iron extremity be triangular: and let its wood be a pyramid narrowed to the extremity, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it upon the bone itself: and let it be near the lachrymal duct: and lengthen your hand from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then revolve your hand with the trepan, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: through this that he finds wind coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with drying styptic medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh grows, and the place hardens: then the matter which was poured out to the exterior, returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter on the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	Concerning the reduction of a protrusion of the eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision: then it is necessary that you loosen the patient; then you should bleed him; afterwards you should apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye from above with a plaster with many small pads.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the small pads is: that you take many soft cloths, and each cloth of them is doubled four times: make many of them: then place them one upon another, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth with a strong binding.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the binding again softens, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly: then remove the binding after a day and a night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	Therefore if you see the eye has returned to the coat of the grape, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and the small pads, and the binding, and the cupping glasses, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Concerning the incision of the grape coat.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the grape coat, then it protrudes and comes forth outside the eyelids like a grape seed, and the appearance of the man is disfigured because of it, and it is necessary to incise it: then the operation in it is, according to what I relate: and it is, that you insert a needle into the root of the grape from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle in which is a double thread from the lachrymal part, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then incise the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the grape around the needle; and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle, and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and leave it until the thread falls with the grape.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the grape is constricted from every part with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds a large prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is perforated with a fine spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and the white moisture flows, and the eye descends, and enters immediately: then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Concerning the treatment of alcomnati.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness which is called alcomnati is nothing but pus which gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is to make the sick person sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head with your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then let it be fixed, and not descend, and the light be resolved: and let the sick person see things as he saw: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula, and incise with it above the corneal layer a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the cornea, until the pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then let it be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Concerning the treatment of water which descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken of the species of water in the division, and what is suitable for perforation by a statement declaring and explaining, then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then therefore it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands squarely, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his sound eye, and bind it tightly: then the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which is the water, is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take in your right hand an almond, if the eye is the left: or in your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the almond near the cornea by the thickness of a ray in the very apparent whiteness of the smaller lachrymal eye: then push the almond with force: and you revolve with it your hand, until it penetrates the white of the eye: and you feel that the almond has now arrived at the empty thing.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the almond to the depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and that is the cornea of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see them in the pupil itself, by the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the almond up to the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards one time after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almond comes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the almond with ease: and you roll your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something of clear gem salt in water: and wash the eye inside with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place outside the eye a whole pledget, or wool infused with rose oil and egg white: and bind with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are of our time, place on it crushed cumin with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	But if the almond does not obey you at entry into the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose form is this.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore pierce with it only the conjunctiva, and do not put your whole hand in the hole: and it is only to make a subtle way to the place of the almond.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almond, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, let a properly made bed be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and let him be forbidden all movements, and coughing: and place his food, that which soothes his nature: and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage remain in its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that dark room, and test his sight: and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not fitting that he do this at the hour of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather it is fitting that he avoid it: because water quickly ascends through vehement gazing.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a warm abscess occurs, then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day: and rectify it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed: then bind up his sight, and place on his face an oral medication by which his sight may be governed under it for a few days, him being in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him gradually leave the house, and converse in his own rooms.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in the cautery the student is not excused from vision sometimes: for then let him dare the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed there has come to us a certain one of those who are from Alayrach, who said that there was made in Alayrach a perforated tube, by which water is sucked.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Truly therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has made it: nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the kinds of tube, that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of bronze properly; and let their ends be triangulated with this same subtlety, and the end sharp.
Formae magda.	Forms of tube.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Concerning the care of flesh grown in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes diverse fleshy growths are produced in the nose, of which some resemble a many-legged scorpion; and of these there is cancerous flesh, stony, dark in color; and of these there is that which is soft flesh, not dark in color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore in that which of these fleshes is soft, not malignant, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you cause the infirm person to sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and throw a hook into those fleshes; then draw them outwards, and incise that which you have grasped of them with a thin sharp spatula from one side, until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	But if something remains of that whose excision is not possible, then shave it with one of the fine instruments easily, until nothing of it remains.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood dominates you, or a warm abscess happens: then oppose it by that which is necessary: or it is of malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then let vinegar, and water, or wine be thrown into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that he is now healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If however the moisture does not penetrate as it ought, then know that within it is flesh grown in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then therefore it is necessary that you insert a linen thread which has a certain thickness, and tie many knots in it: and place between each knot the quantity of a finger, or less: and let the sick man contrive to send one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it similar to azer: and let him draw his breath, until it reaches the cavity, and comes out over his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed boys often do something similar to this in schools: and it is an easy thing for him who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then take and saw the flesh with the knots which are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread: and put into the nose after wiping away the blood a pledget which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then finally put a lead tube in the nose for a few days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if it needs treatment which dries, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a head-purger, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: let it be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its channel similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making a head-purger should be full, open; which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish of juices and liquids.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Concerning the care of nasal polyps.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a polyp grows at the tip of the nose, and becomes large, and increases with the days, until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that it is necessary that you cut it out at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place on the location, either a cautery, or a burning medicine which stands in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore its incision is delayed, until it becomes large, then consider, if it is stony, hard, dark in color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: because it is a cancerous abscess.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For many times I have seen, he who incised such an abscess, and great harm happened to him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible in all of it, then empty the diseased area, and incise it without fear, without dread: and treat the place with that which dries and constricts, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, the operation benefits little, except in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something like that happens to someone, you ought to consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood: and then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture: then treat it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of the discontinuity are already separated, and each part has healed: then it is necessary that you scrape away all the part from its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then bring together the two lips with suture, and tighten them, and powder over it dragon's blood, and crushed olibanum: and put over the powders a piece of diachylon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bandaged for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then untie it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is to bring together the discontinuity, either with needles, as we have narrated in the suturing of the belly: or bring together the discontinuity with thread, as I have let you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Concerning the extraction of knots from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people indeed often have hard abscesses in their inner lips similar to grains of barley: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary that you turn back the lip, and incise over each knot, and lift it with a hook, and incise it on every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with crushed alum, until the bleeding stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then let it be washed with vinegar, and let the place be treated with it, where there is astringency, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Concerning the incision of proud flesh upon the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often there grows upon the gum an excessive flesh, which the ancients called abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore it is necessary that you suspend it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and incise it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place upon the place pounded alum, or other astringent, drying powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	But if that flesh returns after treatment—for often it returns—then incise it a second time and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Concerning the extraction of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough, foul crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth, on the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, and sometimes they blacken and turn yellow and green, until corruption from them reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore you ought to make the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth on which you see crusts and things like sand, until nothing of them remains; and similarly deal with the blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other things until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is in them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second, and a third, until finally you achieve what you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth needs scrapers of diverse forms, many shapes, according to what is prepared for your operation; because the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from below is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of scrapers should be prepared beforehand, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Concerning the extraction of aching teeth.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you treat the tooth for its pain with all skill, and delay in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing that can replace it when it is eradicated: because it is a sublime substance: until when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary, when the patient is compelled to eradicate it, that the aching tooth be firmly and surely grasped by you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a sound tooth and eradicates it: then the pain does not depart, until the diseased tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the practice of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is ascertained by you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps on it in a good position, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have now held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it on every side easily, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and tighten it with the end of a thin rod, so that it is not broken at the time of your tightening upon it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you act carefully with scarification around the gum on every side very much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the patient from that evil which is greater than his first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness concerning its eradication, except that they administer what we have narrated.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For very often they cause great illnesses to happen to men, which are more difficult to break, and all, or some of its roots remain; or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have often testified to that.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then let it be rinsed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	But if a flow of blood should occur from the places (for it often happens), then grind something of zegi, and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved, let them be of long ends, short handle, thick, so that they do not bend when pressure is applied with them to the tooth: let them be like you see of thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not yield to each other, nor bend: of short ends, and let them be made of good iron, or of properly made steel, of straight ends: and at their ends let there be teeth, some of which enter into others, and grip with a decent, strong constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the ends are made like the shape of the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of broken jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When, in the eradication of a tooth, something of it remains, then it is necessary that you place a poultice with butter on the place for one or two days, until the place softens: then introduce into it forceps, or pincers; the ends of which are similar to the mouth of a bird which is called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This, however, is the shape of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their ends be made like a file within: or like aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not yield to exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you scrape above the root, and uncover all the flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called a small lever, of which this is the form.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the extremity be short, somewhat thick: and let it not be brittle, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root comes out through it, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments, whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first is triangular at the end, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of a triangular end, slender.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also helped with this instrument having two branches, of which this is the form.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the matter of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also let there be help with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this form, of a twisted triangular end, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break: and let it not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that the instruments for teeth are many: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and the skillful artisan, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument, according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves signify to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because there are illnesses to which the ancients did not describe an instrument, because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if a bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then examine it in its place with that which is suitable to it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with a gouge, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone may be tightened, or held with it, and not escape and move, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then shave it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Concerning the sawing of teeth projecting above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth project not according to their natural course, the form becomes foul thereby; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, those who are for sale.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is grown after another tooth, and is not located, or its sawing or filing is possible, then eradicate it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then incise it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made of strong iron, very sharp at the end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision, by which you incise it, be over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is prominent and exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of iron, of which this is the form.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely of iron, and its handle of very small points, like a file with which needles are made; with which the tooth may be filed little by little over many days easily, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then smooth it, finally shave it with certain razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	But if it is a tooth, from which a part is broken, and injures the tongue: then it is necessary that you file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made even: and smoothed, and does not injure the tongue, nor impair speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Concerning the fastening of teeth with gold threads.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When a shaking and movement happens to the front teeth from a blow or a fall: and the sick person cannot bite on what he eats so that it does not fall out: and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment has not worked: then the method is that they be fastened with gold thread; because silver turns green and rots after a time; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be medium in fineness and thickness according to the amount it takes between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the manner of fastening is that you take a thread, and insert the double of it between two healthy teeth; then weave with the two ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether it is one or more, until you reach with the weaving to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving until the part from which you began; and tighten your hand with skill and wisdom until it is not moved at all; and let your tightening of the thread be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors; and join both, and twist them together; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue; then let it remain so bound.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it loosens or is cut, tighten them with another thread, and it will remain thus for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth, and the manner of fastening two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after the fall of both, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and this is done only by a skillful, prudent, and experienced craftsman.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes something is fitted from the bones of animals; and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and is placed in the place from which the tooth is supported and tightened, as we have said; and it remains, and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the incision of the ligament which happens under the tongue and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound which has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in it is that you open the mouth of the sick person at his head in your lap, and lift up his tongue: then incise that sinewy ligament across, until the tongue is released from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	But if in it there is something of hardness and knotting, and it is from the healing of a wound: then throw a hook into it, and split it across, until you incise the ligament, and the knotting is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware lest there be a fissure in the depth of the flesh, and you incise an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then let the place of the incision be washed with rosewater, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a linen pledget, which the sick person should hold throughout the night: so that it does not heal up again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded alum on the place.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a slow cautery, which is suitable for it; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Concerning the extraction of a ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue which resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it is magnified so much that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in it is that you open the mouth of the sick person before the sun: and consider the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of a dark or black color, hard, to which the sick person feels no sensation: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it inclines to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw in it a hook, and incise it with a thin spatula, and free it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	But if blood overcomes you in the hour of your operation, then place on it crushed alum until the blood is stopped: then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be washed with vinegar and salt: and cure it with the remaining treatment suitable for it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes abscesses occur between the throat glands, that is, glands which resemble the glands which occur externally: and they are called the two tonsils: which when you treat with what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore the abscess is hard, of a dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood, but rather leave it until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will perforate it: or it will break open by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then it must be incised.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in it is that you should consider before its operation, if the heat of its abscess has quieted completely, or is lessened by some diminution: then therefore make the sick person sit before the sun, and let his head be in your bosom: and open his mouth, and let a servant take [a tool] between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, of which this is the form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	Therefore, when you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your vision falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, except that you draw something of the tunics with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then incise it with an instrument, of which this is the form which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is similar to scissors; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other sharply: therefore take care that it is made of tempered iron, or imbued alfuled.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then incise it with a spatula, of which this is the form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you incise one tonsil, incise the other according to this same kind of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if a flow of blood happens to him, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and things similar to them from among the styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses are produced in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore incise them according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I indeed once treated a woman of an abscess which had formed between her throat, which drew towards blackness, little sensation, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her eating, and drinking water: and she had already come to death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches until they came out above the two openings of the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	Therefore I hastened, and fixed a hook in one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where it was grasped from the opening of the nose.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same to that which protruded from the other opening of the nose.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it: therefore the woman's throat was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to incise that abscess many times for a long time: and the abscess succeeded in the place of that which I incised, until it was greatly prolonged and with it that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore I devised, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore it stopped from increasing: then I went away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Concerning the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When catarrh descends to the uvula, and becomes an abscess, and is long: then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a grape.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot abscess has subsided from it, and it is thin: then it is necessary to incise it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is gathered from it is round, and has no length, and is bloody, or brown, or black, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in it there is fear for the patient.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I described, from its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit facing the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument, the description of which preceded: then fix a hook in the uvula, and pull it downwards: and incise it with one of the two instruments which I described in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you not incise from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you incise more of it, you will injure the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what we have described in the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the patient is frightened by the incision: then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in it is not, except with a sharp instrument; and it is that you place the head of the patient in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take of the water which I told you in the chapter on cauterizing, and mix with it unquenched lime, and put it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the form.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremity of it in which the medicine is placed have a concavity, like the concavity of a spoon's bowl.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself; and let the patient be lying on his side, so that the saliva may run from his mouth from the inside of the medicine, so that nothing from it may descend to his throat and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you should hold it over the uvula for the amount of half an hour, until you see it now blackened, and the biting of the medicine calmed.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a pledget, and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the pledget with medicine, and insert the spoon with the pledget into the cannula from above, until the pledget adheres to the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you achieve what you wish of the cauterization of the uvula.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it: for it itself dries and falls after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	But if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the uvula with a pledget soaked in butter, and clean with it what is around it of the medicine: and rinse with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it is to be treated externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore this method of treatment is healthier than incision and further removed from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the uvula is also treated with something finer than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamint, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sage, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and combine all of them, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be luted with clay properly: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or bronze: and let the end, in which a pomegranate is placed, be inserted into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor ascends to the uvula through a small tube, until the uvula is much darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the arrival of the abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it often adds to the abscess: and it is not fitting that you do it except at the decline of its hot abscess.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube, and place on its end an eggshell: so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned; because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is among good treatments with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone, or fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore it is necessary that you extract what of them is apparent upon which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument towards the sun, and it is made clear to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the infirm person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the infirm person swallow a piece of turnip, or the root of lettuce, or swallow a morsel of dry bread: or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge; and tie it on a thread, then let him swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it arrives at the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be somewhat thicker than a radius, and at its extremity let there be a curve, which he may easily insert into his throat; and let him have his head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest coughing should occur, and let him push the bone or spine with it, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that the sick man should insert it is better, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing; and let him push it downwards, or draw his hand with the instrument upwards, all of it according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is medicated with that which I mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then examine in the throat of the sick man before the sun, or by the sun, after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon a leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine tweezers carefully.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	But if it is not possible with them: then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the throat of the sick man as far as the throat: then insert into the concavity of the cannula an iron heated with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the sick man abstain from water the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not come out with what we have recounted, then fumigate the sick man with bugs, or with asafoetida with the instrument which I recounted in the fumigation of the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because it itself will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals with fire: and the pot is covered with a cover, in the middle of which there is a hole: and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw in the fumigation, and let the sick man put his mouth to the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has now reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that it come out with this regime.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon the eye itself.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is a roughness like a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go of it completely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to what comes to mind of them, namely one, and one in this book: and they differ in their perforation, and incision of them in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is from the species of the abscess itself, and that which it contains of humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is because of the places in which it happens in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among abscesses there are some which it is not necessary to perforate except after the maturation of the pus in them and its completion: and among them there are some which it is necessary to perforate while they are raw, and not matured according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses which are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its duration is prolonged until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: wherefore it is a more proximate cause of the contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or there is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that member, or through it the principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it immaturely: and it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and a fistula be formed, or it be formed in its end which is not healed.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of an abscess which has matured according to its completion: and that is at the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the abscess: and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of more vehement eminence: and let the perforation go in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of muscles, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and lastly in all equal places, in which there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	However, in those which are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When however the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you delay its perforation, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and foulness, and perhaps its lips and its depth will harden.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body in necessity: or according to that which the member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a large perforation: or many incisions according to the likeness of the magnitude of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are some abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be hollowed out: and incised when it has already become like a cloth, and has become at the point that it is already dead: as that which happens in many, such as boils and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And some of them are those which are cut with a three-angled incision.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And of them is that which is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like the abscess of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And some of them are those in which a round incision and a lunate incision are administered: and similar to them from among the incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That, however, which does not have a head, such as are soft superficial abscesses, it is necessary that you perforate it with a superficial or only flat perforation.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when an abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, that you do not hasten and extract all the pus at that time:  but rather extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then stop up the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times gradually, until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old, decrepit person; for the animal spirit is often dissolved from the body with the exit of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, by which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	Therefore if the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply linen cloths, or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures of perforation, then it is necessary that you insert a linen cloth into each fissure, until they meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the abscess you have cut away part of the skin, or have hollowed it out around the edges: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is woven, or is scraped with flax lint without moisture: and bind it tightly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them: and apply it to the place of bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have recounted in many places of this our book, and from the division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the winter time, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you infuse little powders with warm wine and oil: and place them on the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place powders soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when it shall be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you resolve the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer in its treatment that which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This therefore is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the way of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment summarily individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of the species of Nodes, which contain tunics, which are sacs for them: as if they themselves were the wattles of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their species are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are fatty; and some of them contain a humidity similar to mud; and some of them contain a humidity similar to cooked vegetables and porridges; and similar things; and some of them are hard, like stone.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as an artery does not oppose their incision.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their incision is that you should explore them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains humidity, then incise it with a longitudinal incision, a superficial incision: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the incision from line b. to line g. When therefore the humidity is evacuated, then scrape out the cyst which contains that humidity, and do not leave anything of it at all.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For very often it returns, if anything of it remains.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then dip a pledget in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remains of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat on it a pledget with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing of the cyst remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	But if the abscess contains a fatty node, then cut it according to this form, the incision having the form of a cross; and throw hooks between the lips of the incision, and scrape it from every part; and try your strength in extracting the membrane which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if an artery opposes you, then do what I shall tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it is of little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in certain men, with which there is entirely no moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman, and I found an abscess like a solid and hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken; and if someone were to strike it with something thrown, it would wound him.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses however occurring in the head, besides these namely abscesses which occur in the heads of children, and near the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or place their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus may be relieved downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with what is suitable for them from treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Concerning the incision of the Strophulae in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And concerning those which of them occur in the neck, there is one, and many: and they are generated from one another: and every Strophula of them is within its own tunic, just as it is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of these Strophulae are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And of them some are stony: and of them some contain humors: and of them some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, in that one of them which you see of good disposition to the touch, whose evident color is near to that of the skin, and moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the jugular vein, nor to the artery, nor is deep: you ought to cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line b to the line g, and flay it from every side: and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is important to be cautious, lest a vein or nerve be cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the spatula not be very sharp: lest it injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or an artery, or it prevents you from operating, then put on the wound crushed egg-white, or some powders which staunch blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins and wants to suppurate.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stanched. Therefore return to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then investigate with your index finger if anything remains of the small pustules or other small things: therefore incise them and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if there is a large vein at the root of the pustule: then it is necessary that you not incise that pustule from its root; rather it is necessary that you tie it with strong doubled thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old linen which you have previously submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire pustule is incised, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and dress it immediately, after you see that absolutely no excess remains.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that excess remains because of the size of the pustule, then it is necessary that you proceed to incise its root and extract it: and administer the suture which we have described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And which of the pustules contains moisture, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that the place of its maturity appears to you: and place the perforation from that which follows the lower part of the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation a pledget with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound to be already cleansed: then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said that this incision is in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those having quinsy, the incision of the epiglottis must be avoided: since no help is done by it; because all the veins and the lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	Truly in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in the two tonsils, when there is no illness in the trachea, it is necessary to use incision of the epiglottis, to escape from the destruction which happens from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do it, we must incise the epiglottis between three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across, in that which is between two circles, to the extent that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage: and indeed this place is suitable for incision, since it is free from flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	But if the physician is timid, then it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should cut the skin, until when he arrives at the trachea: he should avoid a blood vessel, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the membrane which we have described: and the incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm which comes out of it, with that which is broken, and by the loss of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	Therefore, when the time in which suffocation is feared is removed, bring together the two lips of the skin wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this discourse which we have narrated is this:  unless they see that one of these abscesses has already blocked the throat of the patient, and the patient is close to death, and wishes his breathing to be cut: they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient breathes through the wound site with a certain respiration, and is saved from death; and for this reason they order that the wound be left open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed, and its malignancy lasts for three days, or thereabouts: then they order the wound to be sewn and cared for until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw with my own eyes is that a maidservant took a knife and put it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to her treatment, and I found her roaring like the roar of the dying.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore uncovered the wound, and found little blood which had flowed from the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor the gullet; and wind was coming out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore cleansed and sutured the wound, and treated it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice: and after some days she returned to her better condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that in the incision of the epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the incision of a throat hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is found much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two methods: for it is either natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one certainly there is no pus.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one however is according to two methods: of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other method is similar to an abscess which comes from the knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear, and it is not necessary that presumption be made to it with iron, except in that which is small: and you prove it, and investigate it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected with any veins: then cut it, just as nodes are cut: and extract it with what contains it from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then explore the whole of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with what is necessary from treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Concerning the incision upon the kinds of nodes.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already mentioned all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary that I relate here the difference between a Node and an Exitura, since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when an Exitura is heat, and fever, and vehement pains, until the boiling over of superfluity is settled, and putrefaction is completed: then indeed fever and heat are quiet.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	With a Node however there is not heat, nor fever, nor pains, and a sifachin cyst contains them, which is a proper sac for them, and is according to the color of the body: and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fat: or they contain humidity.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore it is necessary, when you arrive at the treatment of a Node, that you examine it, and investigate it firstly with an instrument which is called Intromissum, according to what its form will be in the chapter which is after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of investigating abscesses, and all Nodes is, that you take this instrument, and introduce it into the most humid place, which you find in the abscess: and you revolve your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then move your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider that which comes forth in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore a running moisture comes forth, whatever its colour may be: then incise it with a superficial incision, according to what I said in the other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes forth in the track of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty: therefore incise it above with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and flay the skin from every part with ease: and keep the cyst if you can over it, so that you extract it whole with the Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the cyst bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it piecemeal, until nothing of it remains.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or much of it remains, the Node returns to a great extent.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if it overcomes you, and a little remains of it: then fill the wound at your completion with certain sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place over it what sits a hot abscess, and treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore the Node is large, then sew its two lips, and treat it with that which incarnates.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if you have a pulsating or non-pulsating vein opposite: then hasten, and fill the place with pounded zegi, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies, and the boiling of the blood ceases: then return to incising what remains of the Node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning the instruments for cutting and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Of these are the shapes of the intromittents, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For of them there is a large one, and of them there is a medium one, and of them there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of well-tempered iron, square-ended, so that they readily enter the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the shapes of the perforating instruments, and one of them is called a beris, that is, a perforator: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For of them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suitable for investigating by means of them abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes from what is between them of bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, soft, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of citrine, or of bronze, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those which are made of citrine.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And they are also made from black lead, which are suitable for investigating by means of them fistulas, whose cavities have reflections, so that they are reflected with their softness along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And again they are of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because among them are long ones, among them medium ones, and among them short ones, according to the amount of the size of the fistula and its stricture.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because among them are simple ones, namely those which have one curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And among them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and skinned: and they are of three kinds: for among them is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their ends with which the cutting is done are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except that with them help is given in the skinning of nodes for fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that the sick man may be healed by them, and find some tranquility from the burning which he finds in the skinning of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the magdae, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of bronze, and are similar to a spatula with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end is a hidden spatula-point: and in it it runs inwards and outwards when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the spatulas which are hidden between the fingers in the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The shapes of the cupping-glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat long, as you see: and let them be thin.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping-glasses be with you, large and small: so that you may cut off blood with speed when necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them in cutting off blood in every place of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the thighs of the leg, and the hip, and the thighs of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar to them, from fleshy, moist places.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes small instruments are made from them, similar to the husks of pistachios, according to their form: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Concerning the care of the nipples of men which are similar to the nipples of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the nipples of some men swell upon the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they are similar to the nipples of women: and they remain badly festering.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	He who therefore abhors that, ought to cut above the nipples with a lunar incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then flay all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill the wound with incarnative medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and tend it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the nipple declines downwards, and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that it be split on its two upper sides with two incisions similar to the lunar figure, each of which is joined with the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards flay the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said of suture and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	But if you do not complete the incision of what you ought to incise, because of the patient's restlessness, or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a pledget soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then tend it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the perforation of an abscess which occurs under the armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	Those abscesses which occur under the armpit are of the hard kinds of strumae, which contain cysts, and some of them contain fluids.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those therefore which contain fluids ought to be incised with a lunate incision, in this manner, from line b. to line g.  When therefore all that is in the abscess of pus is evacuated, then fill it with old tow, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let the tow be removed, and let it be treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	But if the abscess is of the kind of nodes of strumae, then incise it as we said in the section on strumae equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs because of an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it is consolidated, then an abscess often results from this; and similarly it happens with a vein also, that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a grating in it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And incision upon this abscess is a mistake, especially that which is under the armpits and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, its treatment with iron must be avoided, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, must be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, for that which is from the swelling of the opening of an artery, make a longitudinal incision in the skin.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the artery; and free it from the tunics until it is uncovered.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with double thread in two places, as I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood which is in it flows out, and the abscess is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment which produces pus, until the ligatures fall off; afterwards treat it with ointments suitable for it, until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	But if there is an abscess because of a section of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what you can of the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the abscess with a good ligature: according to what I said to you in the ligature of a grape, from two parts with two ends of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the needle: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its middle, until when comes out what is in it: then incise the superfluous skin, and leave what is tied of it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place on it a small pillow which you have submerged in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment, which is done with linen cloths and ointments, until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning an abscess which happens from the twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess happens in an artery and vein, similarly an abscess happens in the nerves: which happens in them through a blow, or happens from excessive labor, and similar things; and it happens mostly in the places of the joints, or the heel, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many conditions without pain: and when it is squeezed forcefully, the sick person feels in it something like numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess collected deep in the body, indeed it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and it does not go forward, or before, nor backward behind.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what is of them in the joints, it is not necessary that it be invaded with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps, indeed, a contraction will happen.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which of them is in the head, or in the forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and flay it: then remove it, and close the wound with suture: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the incision of an abscess which happens in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	It happens to some men many times in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies,  thelil, which are called Fungalia, because of their similarity to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is slender, and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small; and some of them become very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I myself have seen a man, and in his belly were two thelil, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, small root, and their lips were inverted, and they were split, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore I cut them, and found in one about eighteen ounces in weight and in the other about six ounces. And the operation in cutting them is that you should consider then, if the patient is moist, and the color of the thelil is white, moist, with a slender root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and let cauteries be ready for you in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For very often much blood is expelled during its section: therefore, if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it quickly.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	But if you see the patient is fearful and timid of incision with iron, then take a suitably made lead thread, and tie the thelil with it: the method of which is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead ligature.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease tightening the lead, as often as it presses on the thelil, until it is cut off, and falls off by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the thelil has a thick root, then there is something of fear and dread in its incision: especially that which is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless, it is possible to incise half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you presume to incise a thelil which is brown in color, of little feeling, foul in appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess; and I shall come to the remembrance of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Concerning the treatment of the protrusion of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	A protrusion of the umbilicus happens from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures of the fascia which is over the belly; and from it protrudes fat or intestine, according as it happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood which flows from a vein or from an artery, according to what has been said before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from wind constricted there.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if it is because of a fissure of the fascia and a protrusion of fat, then it is similar in color to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain; and it appears in various places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is because of the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is, with that which we have narrated, of more significant variety.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is much magnified at the entrance of the bath, and considerable effort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If however it is because of moisture, it is soft, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor constricted, nor is anything added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	But if it is because of blood, then with these signs a swelling appears tending towards blackness.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is because of a growth of flesh: then it is a serious swelling, large, hard, and fixed according to a single quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If however it is because of wind, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that is, that you consider then, if the protrusion of the navel is because of blood of an artery, or vein, or wind: then it is necessary that you are forbidden from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I spoke of swellings because of an artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	But if the protrusion of the navel is because of intestine, or hernia: then it is necessary that you instruct the patient, insofar as he holds his breath, and stands standing stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with a cautery around the whole navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards instruct him, that he lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a broad spatula around the navel over the place which you marked with a cautery.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards extend the middle of the abscess upwards, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it around firmly with thread, or with a strong silk cord: and let the knot of the ligature be secure.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find it already seized by the ligature: then pull on the ligature, and insert your index finger, and push the intestine into the interior of the abdomen: and if you find a hernia, then seize it with a hook, and incise its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if an artery or vein is contrary to you, then surround it greatly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert the two needles into the circumference which you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then constrict the abscess in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and falls by itself: or incise it when it becomes thin and putrefies.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	But if the prominence of the umbilicus is from raw flesh in it, or from humidity: then it is necessary that you hollow out the abscess, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or humidity, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Concerning the care of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of cancer, and how there is a way to its cure with medicines: and it must be avoided in its treatment with iron, so that it is not ulcerated: and we have spoken of cancer generated in the womb, and caution from its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: such as cancer which is in the breasts, or in the hip, and similar to them, from the limbs situated so as to extract it entirely: especially when it is small in the beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When, however, it is old, and is large, it is not fitting that you approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I have not been able to cure anyone of it: nor have I seen another before me who has succeeded in it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in it, when it is situated as we have said, is that you precede, and relieve the patient of black bile sometimes.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomize him if you find him with manifest repletion.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with a preparation, in which he is placed with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw hooks into the Cancer which are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to exploration, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood run, and do not cut it off quickly, but rather press the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever is possible there of instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already recounted in the division the types of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs, and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is only a type of ascites alone; and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympanitis, nor in the case of hyposarca entirely, for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanitis, with medicines, and your treatment has not helped, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient has already suffered weakness, or has another illness besides dropsy, such as a cough, or diarrhea, and things like that, then beware of treating him with iron, because that is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the method of operation in him is that you raise the standing patient between your hands, and the assistant behind him presses his abdomen with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spiny spatula, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be of two sharp parts, long, the sharp end like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, let there be some shortness in it gradually, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation as far as the intestine and injure it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen the incision from the navel by the amount of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubis.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the generation of dropsy is due to illness of the liver, then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then perforate the whole skin with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with a spatula between the skin and the fat, as if you are flaying it; and let the amount that is flayed be the amount of a fingernail, or thereabouts.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then perforate the fat until the spatula reaches the empty place; and that is the place of the water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument, of which this is the form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: which in its lower part has a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other: and its end is incised, according to the manner of the incision of a reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a moderate amount.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps the patient dies from the dissolution of his vital spirit; or a syncope occurs to him which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the amount of his strength, and according to what the patient's conditions signify to you from the strength of his pulse, and from the goodness of it.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Which is because it is immediately retained because of the skin which retains the opening which is on the sifac: of which I have spoken, so that you pierce it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the following day, if you see the patient tolerating it: and also withdraw a small quantity of water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until nothing remains of the water but a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are worried about the patient, and you leave a large amount of water: then treat him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and let him suffer from thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water: according to what I have narrated in what precedes.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the care of infants who are born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When one of the infants comes forth from the womb of its mother, and its urinary passage is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore it is necessary to help with its perforation immediately upon birth with a very fine spatula, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin lead nail in the opening and bind it: and keep it in for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he wishes to urinate, let it be removed, and he will urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then replace it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put in lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is because, of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis; wherefore he cannot urinate forwards, until he raises his penis with his hand upwards.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there generation for him, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it is a very foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in this case is that the patient is laid on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong extension, and incise the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp instrument, or a sharp spatula: just as is the incision of a reed, or as you shave something, so that the middle of it comes to resemble the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as it ought.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware in your operation of a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For that often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore oppose to it that which stops blood, and care for the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning Albucasis, what happens in the foreskin and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These things often happen to the penis according to Albucasis, and it is a protrusion of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And of it, one is malignant, and another not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a thin hook, and you should cut it away until you cleanse it entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place on it lint soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterwards with diafinicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	But if the Albucasis is malignant, of foul colour, then it is necessary that you apply a cautery to it after its incision and shaving.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	But if the Albucasis is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and part of the Albucasis is between the foreskin, and part of it outside: then it is necessary that you remove the Albucasis which is inside first, until when it heals, then treat the outside: because when you treat it simultaneously, the foreskin is not secured from being perforated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now blackness and corruption also happen in the testicles and foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, it is necessary that you hollow out everything that is already blackened, and that wants to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then spread over it afterwards with honey which has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate rinds, and of crushed, sifted herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	But if a flow of blood happens, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For a cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for a flow of blood, and a wound when it is corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	But if the head of the penis is corroded, and the whole thing is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary that you introduce into the passage of the penis a small tube of lead, so that the sick man may urinate over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion, however, of the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this adhesion indeed does not happen, except in him whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon it: and sometimes adhesion happens because of a wound, or an abscess: therefore it is necessary that you scrape it with a blunt spatula, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	But if it is difficult to distinguish them exactly, then it is necessary that you scrape something from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is because when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it is perforated because of its thinness quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated with astringent wine, until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the cure of an error happening to them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we should mark in it a better operation, and a lighter way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books; because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is, because I have found the greater part of surgeons and phlebotomists use cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and they use cautery, and binding with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I indeed have already tested all these methods, and I have not found a better one than cleansing with scissors and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a razor, very often the skin escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is incised, and the lower layer remains; therefore it is forced to make an incision to cut the other, and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the cleansing which is done by cautery, that is, a finger-shaped instrument which seamstresses use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not secured: because perhaps it enters its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron escapes, and spoils your operation: and indeed a child's skin is short by nature, and very often they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have already seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread has revealed a good method to me: because scissors are proportional in incision: therefore, because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation in one time: and a compression is made with a similar shape, containing the skin of the penis from every side, with which no error falls at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of operation is that you make the child, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, understand that you are not doing anything except tying a thread around his penis: and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way that is possible for you, from what his intelligence receives.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands in a prepared position, and let him not be sitting: and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, lest the boy see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand to his penis, and inflate the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the penis emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from the dirt that has gathered on it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards tie a second ligature a little lower down.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature with a good hold, and incise between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then raise the skin quickly upwards, and draw out the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better) and put powder on top: and over the powder a cloth in which is spread the yolk of an egg boiled in rosewater, beaten with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on it until the next day: and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	Now the shape of the forceps for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt, and let them be meeting: lest a branch of the nail come out in them: and let the length of the two sharpened parts be like the length of the two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	An error however occurring in cleansing is: because perhaps the whole inner skin escapes, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you extend it from your hour with your nail before the suppuration of the place: and incise it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then draw it out with a hook, and incise it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days pass it, and what is under the rod remains swollen, suppurated: then leave it, until the warm abscess settles, and flay it easily, and incise it as it is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore treat it with that which consolidates the wound from the powders, which we have recounted in the treatise on powders: and if it is incised from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the higher parts, that also will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Concerning the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growth of flesh, and similar things from those which we have mentioned in the divisions of treatment.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is now in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that the patient be bent over on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, the neck of the bladder is compressed to expel the stone backwards: wherefore the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	But if it is not released by what we have said, and the matter is severe for the patient: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave like the quill of a bird's feather in the slenderness of a ray, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: to which there is a slender tube at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of exiting urine through it is that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool or cotton at its end, a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if anything of the wool is superfluous, but insert it into the tube forcefully, like an elevator.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white: and make the patient sit on a seat, and rub the bladder and its neck with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the penis easily, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it upwards from the part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has now reached the empty thing: and this is not done according to this order, except because the passage, in which it goes, is one in which there is tortuosity.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw it out, and make the urine run through the urinary passage: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease doing that, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is constricted in it, and it is necessary to instill waters and medicines into it: then let it be done with an instrument which is called a Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which is that which impels, should be according to the quantity which fills it without addition, until when something is drawn with it, the moisture is drawn in: and when it is impelled, it is expelled with it to a distance: according to what the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is thrown in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore, when you wish to throw moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with it that which impels upwards, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its end into the tube, as we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then impel the moisture with that which impels it; for then the moisture immediately arrives at the bladder, so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The shape of a slender clyster by which the bladder is clysterized.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or brass: its head should be taller, similar to a small flask, and below it a sinus into which a ligature falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a ram's bladder, and put into it the moisture with which you wish to clysterize the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between the two sinuses with a strong ligature of double thread; and warm that moisture slightly over a fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the clyster into the rectum, afterwards squeeze your hand over the bladder with the moisture with a fitting pressure, until the patient feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and perforate it all around its circumference.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they are rolled up.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as the alsofratu is gathered: after you put into it what you want of moisture, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	Concerning the extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	Now we have spoken in the division of the kinds of stone, and its cure with medicines: and I have spoken of the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs of all of it: and I have spoken of the stone in which operation with the hand and incision falls: and it is the stone generated in the bladder properly: and that which is fixed in the urethra: and I am narrating that with clear exposition and brevity.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore I say that the stone generated in the bladder happens most to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its thinness: and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs his penis, and labors with it, and often it hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised, and the anus comes out with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of boys is easy, until they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in old men.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In young men, however, it is moderate, in that which is between that: and whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if small, the treatment is the opposite.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with a clyster, which draws out all the stool that is in his intestines; for it sometimes prevents the finding of the stone during the search.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the patient be taken with his feet up, and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or rise from a high place sometimes.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit prepared between your hands, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the whole bladder may slope downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the stone in the space, then hasten immediately with the incision upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the patient is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a grown young man: and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place, of which you wish to make an incision: and instruct the assistant, that he press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant, that he extend the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand, that he remove the skin, which is under the testicles in the part from the place where is the incision.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the cutting instrument, whose form is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And cut in that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision is wide externally, and narrow internally, according to the amount that the exit of the stone from it is not greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that of a stone there are angles and edges, wherefore its exit is difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is a smooth one, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore to that which has angles and edges, add to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	But if it does not exit thus, then it is necessary that you work upon it: or that you tie around it with a suitable bandage, whose end is like the moon, which binds the stone, and does not slip from it: or that you insert beneath it a slender instrument, of curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot [work] upon it, then enlarge the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	But if something of blood overcomes you, cut it away with a scalpel.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If however the stone is more than one, then push the largest first towards the opening of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then incise upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards push the small one after it: and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	But if it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut into it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because one of two things happens to the patient, either that he dies, or that continuous urinary dribbling occurs to him; because the place does not completely heal.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But manage its expulsion until it comes out; or contrive its fracture with forceps until you extract it piecemeal.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot abscess may be seated.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the patient on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you have loosened it, bathe the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if a hot abscess occurs in the wound, and corrosions, and similar things: as if the blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented from flowing out: and this is known from the passage of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and draw out that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and apply to every kind of it that which is suitable for its treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment that you bind the two hips together, and bring them together, because of the medicines which are placed on the area.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	But if the stone is small, and is in the passage of the penis, and is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is prevented: then treat it with what I relate before you arrive at incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times you will be excused from incision by this treatment, for I have already proved it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is so that you take a perforator of  steel, whose form is this, with a triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and tie with it the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the perforating iron into the penis easily, until the perforator arrives at the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand in the stone gradually: and attempt its perforation, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For the urine is immediately discharged.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it is broken, and comes out with the urine, and the sick man is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something which prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then pull it out.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and clean the congealed blood which is in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And the ligature of the thread under the stone is not necessary, except so that it does not return to the bladder: and the other ligature above, except so that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, that you raise the skin upwards, so that it returns to its proper place, and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Concerning the extraction of a woman's stone.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is rarely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if a stone should happen to one of them, then the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And a second is, because you do not find a woman who will uncover herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or has a husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	A third is, because you do not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially manual operation.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And a fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	But if necessity compels to that, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-skilled: and few are found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If however you lack that, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a well-taught midwife in women's matters, or a woman who has some skill in this art: therefore make her present, and especially instruct her, that she may do all that you instruct her from the examination concerning the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First, that is, to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore she finds it, let her constrict it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the afflicted woman, and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with the greatest of her strength, until she arrives with it to the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then let her cut upon it at the opposite half of the vulva at the root of the thigh, on whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and let her finger not be removed from the stone, constricting under it: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then let her insert a probe into that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore she feels the stone, then let her add to the incision according to a proportionate amount so that the stone exits from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that the kinds of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its kinds, so that this may signify to you what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place pounded alum, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out: and make sure that you prepare with you from the instruments, which I mentioned in the extraction of the stone in men, so that you may be helped by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	But if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which has been cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it tightly with a suitable bandage: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	Therefore, when the sharpness of the blood has subsided after days, and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Concerning the incision for watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white membrane which is under the skin of the scrotum containing the testicle; and it is called a membrane.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own tunic, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the testicle, until it is considered a different testicle, and is the skin of the testicle between the white membrane which we have mentioned; and this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And indeed the generation of this hernia is from weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either its color inclines toward yellow, or it is red and bloody, or foul and black, or it is white and watery, and this is what is most common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white tunica we have spoken of, then the abscess is round, somewhat long like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in its own proper tunic, then the abscess is round with a part of an egg, and because of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white tunica, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with the introduced square, whose form preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that therefore which comes forth in the track of the introduced instrument, judge concerning that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you order the patient, that he be bled if that is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let him be laid on his back on something a little high, and place many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left, and instruct the assistant, that he sit on his right, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the flank of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, even near to the pubis: and let the incision be made according to the straightness of a line equidistant which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane containing: and flay it and observe, or beware of this, that you cut it: and let your flaying with which you flay it, be from the part which hangs with the egg more: and subtly search with the flaying according to the quantity which is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then perforate the membrane full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the membrane upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles containing: and incise the membrane however it is possible for you to incise it, either with its totality, or piecemeal, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not exquisitely search, in its incision there is no security, lest the water return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the egg proceeds outwardly from its skin in the hour of your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the membrane, replace it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then unite the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	But if you find the egg corrupted by blackness or something else, then it is necessary that you ligate the vessels which are its suspensory, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut away the testicle with its suspensory, and extract the egg; afterwards treat it with what we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two roots: therefore cut the other part as you did the other equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it seems to you that one operation is sufficient, then do it: then wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions wool submerged in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside other wool which you have submerged in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the scrotum: and place on top folded cloths, which are compresses: and bind them on top with a bandage which has six [layers] according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are taken, and sewn, and filled with carded wool, according to this likeness: and let the ends which press be made of tow, or moist wool: and let them be gathered with a tightening in the lumbar region of the breeches: and one end should reach above the anus to the back, and the second should reach to the part of the pubis: and two ends below to the two hips, and two other ends to the two groins, and let the whole tightening be gathered in the lumbar region of the breeches.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this root is treated artificially with cautery in place of incision with iron: and it is that you take a thin, knife-shaped cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have related: until when white pus containing water is revealed: then take a cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It is similar to a Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then perforate that pus with it, and it is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the pus with hooks, and scrape it with a thin, heated cautery, and incise it as much as possible, until you eradicate all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if a hot abscess, or blood flow, or something else opposes you during the incision, or during the cauterization, then you must treat what opposes you with the treatment that suits it, as has been stated before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not await this operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I shall relate: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is confirmed to you by what we have said concerning the signs, that the abscess is watery, then you must make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a broad spatula; and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a pledget over the place, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water may run out; then treat it until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is opposition to the egress of water at the time when you perforate it, and this is only because a white membrane makes opposition at the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of the water, then it is necessary that you introduce a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of dropsies is drawn off, the form of which has preceded; or add to the operation of the wound a little.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and is collected after six months, or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it is collected, then let it be perforated in the same way, and the sick person will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Concerning the treatment of fleshy fistulas.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the incision upon this fistula, there is fear leading to destruction in many conditions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore its dismissal seems to me to be its salvation.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	Therefore I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are formed: and this happens from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Either from an excess of something sharp or acrid, which is poured out to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from a knotting of the arteries, and their swelling: as its mention has already preceded: or from a swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, that which is from them [i.e., from among these causes] from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That, however, which happens from the swelling of the veins, does not disperse anything from it upon compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that an incision is made upon this kind and upon the remaining flesh: and it is, that you cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the testicle upward, and extract it with the white sheath; and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and ligate the vessels; and incise the spermatic cord after you free it from every part of the parts of the testicle.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the testicle is consolidated with those newly grown flesh, then it is necessary that you pull the testicle and incise it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something of the sheath, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion, and incise it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you incise all of it, and extract the testicle, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Concerning the treatment of fistulas, which is with a vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	A vine is a swelling enveloped in a certain wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles: and it makes movement and exercise, and walking, difficult for the patient.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness is fear, because of that which preceded its remembrance.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Truly it is necessary that we speak of the operation on it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	Therefore I say that it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspensory of the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the vessels which are near the penis: and let another assistant hold them, and extend them with a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then incise with a broad, sharp spatula with a transverse incision in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are uncovered.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then flay from every side, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards, insert into them a needle in which there is a double thread, and tie it in the first place where the veins meet: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the foul, corrupt humours.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which pus is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle may fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For there is no harm through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if it happens that a vein affects all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed with the vessels: lest the egg be deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and waste away, or dry up, and there be no benefit with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Concerning the treatment of intestinal fistula.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The outcome of this fistula is from a section which happens in the sifach extended over the belly in the groin region from the mirach of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the sifach or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy thing, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	Is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and there is an equal abscess towards the depth: because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign when it is from a cutting of the sifach, because it causes a vehement pain suddenly from its beginning: and the abscess is different, appearing under the nearby skin: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes the zirbum exits with the intestine: and this is named intestinal Ramex, and zirbia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes excrement runs into the intestine, and is retained there: and with it is the destruction of the sick person: because it causes a bad pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this kind of illness with iron there is fear: wherefore it is necessary that the case be avoided in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is, that you instruct the sick person to return the intestine with his hand to the inside of his cavity, if it obeys return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he is laid supine upon his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin which follows the skin to the upper parts, and cut the whole skin of the testicles lengthwise.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and the incision should be of such a size that the egg may, if possible, come out of it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then flay the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until, when the white siphak is uncovered, hard on every side: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and absolutely loosen with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand: and with this extend the white siphak upwards with your left hand: and raise the egg with the siphak to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards: and you loosen the adhesion which is behind with complete loosening.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers, so that there may be nothing there of the intestine involved in the hard white siphak.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find something of it, then push it downwards to the belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads: and insert it near the last siphak, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over some with a figure which is in the manner of a cross: and tie with them the alsifach, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until nothing from the vessels which nourish them can send anything to them: so that a hot abscess may not happen from it.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again a second ligature outside the first ligature, less than two fingers distant from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures leave from the siphak, which is under the skin of the testicles, the amount of the size of a finger: and cut all the rest according to the roundness, and remove from it the testicle.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles an incision, from which blood and pus flows: as we have related in what precedes.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound: and apply the ligature which we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white siphak which we have mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be moistened with warm water: and place on it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning a cupping instrument with a tube.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this cupping instrument I have not seen anyone who dared to operate on it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first ones said that it is done as we have narrated in the cupping instrument which is with a tube.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, to tie the vessels after the incision upon it with ease below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away; and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning the rupture which occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all hours: truly if time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that happens from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groins, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the sifach is extended; then it softens, and the place suppurates, and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its cure is with a cautery, as its account preceded.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and it is, that the sick man lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the place of the rupture of the abscesses and the protruding part, with a cut across, according to the amount of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then constrict the alsifak and what are under the skin, until when the white sifach is uncovered, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a radius, and place it on the protruding place of the sifach, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew two protruding places on the end of the radius from the sifach, and connect one of them with the other with a suture: then withdraw the end of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the alsifach completely, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I made you know in the treatment of intestinal rami.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	Therefore, when you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the sisach is contracted, and no prominence is added to the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, on account of which the flesh which is between them is softened, and its appearance is made foul.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked in its cure, that he make the sick man lie on his back, and cut away all the skin which is softened upon the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he shall bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, sew first the superfluity of the softened skin with three sutures, or four, and make the suture firm.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then incise between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat with the treatment of the other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	Concerning castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is forbidden in our law: and because of that it would be permitted to me not to mention it in this my book: and its mention is not necessary, except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it: and that he should know the treatment of him to whom it has happened.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by fissure and incision.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	Now in that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	But in castration by fissure and incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut above each testicle with one incision, until when the two testicles come forth: then incise them after you have skinned each one, and do not leave on them of the *sifak* anything except the thin *sifak* which is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite in two ways.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite from men is according to two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is that which appears in what follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a figure like the vulva of a woman, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one species, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubis like very small male testicles, projecting outwardly: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three kinds, two from men, and one kind from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut away the added flesh, until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second kind of men, however, from which urine exits, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the incision of the frenulum, and of the prominent flesh in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The frenulum is perhaps added to a natural thing, until it is defiled and its appearance becomes foul; and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it is spread out like in men, and reaches even to coitus.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore it is necessary that you hold the excess of the frenulum with the hand, or with a hook, and incise it; and do not be excessive in the incision, especially in the depth of the root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	The flesh that arises is flesh which is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it goes out to the exterior according to the likeness of a tail; and because of that some first name the illness tailed.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary that we incise it just as we incise the frenulum, and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the imperforate vulva of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is, that is, the vulva of a woman is not perforated, or the opening is small.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from a preceding illness: and this indeed happens either from added, grown flesh, or a thin membrane, or a thick one: and it happens either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of it is made by the midwife's examination, if the obstruction is apparently close.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the obstruction is from a thin membrane, and is close to the two lips: then hasten, and break it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is so, that you place small cushions on the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place the index fingers of your two hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips forcefully, until the thin membrane is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the place: and let the woman have intercourse every day, so that the place does not consolidate in another way.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the membrane is thick, dense, then it is necessary that you cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the obstruction is of a fleshy nature, then suspend it with hooks, and incise it: and have with you medicines that stanch the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not consolidate quickly, hold it for several days: and administer a pledget of dry linen, then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes other fleshy growths are born in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be incised in this manner: provided it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb, do not in any way oppose it with iron.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor rubea in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the orifices of the veins, until much blood flows from them continually.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids become old, they become athelil: and I have already spoken in the division of their species, and their signs: and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those of them which are in the orifice of the womb upon which the senses fall, are those which are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the athelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then pulverize upon them at the flow of blood from one of the incisive powders without mortification: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then let him push her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and pomegranate bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it upon her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, apply cupping-glasses to the back and breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarthith, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the branches of alaulat, that is, aglanter, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the abscess is quiet, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth however is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you incise what appears of it, according to what I said in thelil equally: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Concerning the perforation of the Exitura which happens in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIIII.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I indeed already have spoken of all these illnesses and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I speak in this treatise of the hot abscess which happens in the womb, when it is of the abscesses which gather pus, and you wish to know how its opening is done with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it redden: if numbness falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps in maturation, until when the acuteness of the symptoms rests.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat which surpasses two seats, and she is reclined, or she is laid upon her back, and she draws her feet to the lower part of her belly: and let her hips be spread, and let her put her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable ligature to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those which are later.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix with a radius the depth of the woman's womb: so that that which enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harms the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions upon the covering of the depth of the womb: so that the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb may be prevented: and it is necessary that he place the handle, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that he hold the instrument, and that the attendant revolve the handle, until the depth of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by hand, and is smooth and soft: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a linen cloth submerged in rose oil: or in green oil, in which there is some styptic quality: and place the linen cloth, and draw out the section in the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally upon the womb, and upon the pubis, clean wool submerged in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be treated after two days with an ointment which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is clysterized with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily, or long birthwort has been boiled: then it returns to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	But if the wound is hidden internally in the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from its treatment with iron, indeed treat it with that which we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	On the teachings of midwives, how live embryos, having emerged according to a non-natural form, are to be treated.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 76.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to know first the form of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman being compressed downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and that which is upon her of the birth is lightened, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends head first, the afterbirth descends with it, and is cleansed from those superfluities by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But that which is besides this birth, is unnatural, blameworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Because sometimes the fetus exits on its feet, and its body exits before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hands exit: or its belly exits: and perhaps it is turned about its neck, and similar things from blameworthy forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, skillful in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form of them, and what its nature is, and is signified by it, and is to be relied upon.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus exits head first in its natural way, and this is vehement for the woman, and birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her: and steam her vulva with a decoction of fenugreek, and with warm oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and let her break the secundine with it, and cut it with her nail, until that which is in it of moisture flows out: and press the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then instruct her after the clyster, that she be compressed: and make her sneeze with sneezing powder, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will exit immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	But if two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you reduce them with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey in entering, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upward: then shake the seat upon the ground: and let the woman be held, so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	Therefore if the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then incise them, and extract the remainder of the fetus: and bind its hand with a cloth, and extract it evenly: for then it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo upon its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out upon its feet, then it is necessary that you push them upward: then turn the fetus gradually: afterward straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then let him take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When therefore they come out as far as the hips, then instruct him that he be compressed, and make him sneeze with sternutatories: for he will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not come out with what we have recounted, then return the fetus gradually, until you place him according to the natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For then he will come out with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if it is prevented with all that we have recounted: then take of mallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound all in a mortar with a good pounding: then anoint with it the vulva of the woman, and the lower part of her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until it reaches the hypochondria.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	Therefore, when you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make a pessary for her of myrrh: and insert it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore the pessary has remained for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and compress her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus is over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out in this manner, then he will succeed in introducing his hands gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman will be laid on her neck, and her feet will hang downwards: and she will be lying on the bed, and will clasp her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gradually on her belly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under her feet from the cushions, until she is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	But if the fetus does not come out, then take its feet, and move them with a strong movement.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypochondria gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let him insert his hands, and equalize the fetus gradually: and instruct the woman to bear down, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Skill will be needed in the reduction of his hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with a strong shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	But if childbirth seizes her, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive at the reduction of the hand, and adjust the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to strain herself, until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with its hands outstretched, and its face is towards its mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it, and adjust it easily.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When therefore it is adjusted, then place on her vulva what we have recounted of oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When therefore you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean to her right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to bear down; and make her sneeze with sneezing powders.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus is on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then tear the afterbirth with your fingernail, until it is emptied of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inwards, until you place it as is proper: and instruct the woman to bear down several times: for it will itself exit easily.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are very often born: and sometimes three, and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five, however, is unnatural, and they do not live at all: and one afterbirth contains them, however many there are: and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing between them, attached to the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out as one fetus comes out by a natural, easy exit; and they come out by an unpraiseworthy exit, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	But if some of them are difficult at birth, and they arrive at what we have spoken of concerning unnatural positions, then treat them as we have narrated: and let there be a skilled midwife, and let her do what she does with speed and slowness, and let her contrive according to every position with what is prepared for her from skill leading to health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Concerning what is formed in the womb from embryos, and is aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has been verified by me, that a woman miscarried and expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore all this ought to be in the knowledge of a midwife.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For perhaps something similar will come to her; therefore let her oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division of medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then you ought to consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound health, and is not afflicted with any of the accidents from which loss is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine on a bed, on her back, and her head be inclined lower, and her legs raised; and a servant should hold her from two sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body is not drawn out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the os uteri with moist oils with marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed mucilage.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her introduce it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let her seek with it the place in which to fix hooks from the fetus, and suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend on its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is on its feet, then in its pubis and middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand: and introduce it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have said, until she reaches the empty thing.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then let her fix in opposition to it another hook, or a third, if needed: so that the traction is equal, and does not incline to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with an equal extension, and let the extension not be according to straightness only, but rather let it be moved to every part, so that its exit is eased: just as is done with a tooth at its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary that that which is between them be softened for the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	But if a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil, and introduce them from the side, so that she may revolve with them that which is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then let the hooks be changed to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore a hand comes out before other things, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until, when it comes out completely, you incise it either at the joint of the sole, or at the elbow; and thus you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the head of the fetus is large, or constriction happens to it in its exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary that he introduce between the fingers a spiny spatula, and split the head with it, and extract the water; or break it with the instrument which is called Almisdac, the form of which comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus is of the nature of a large head, then it is necessary that you cut with algengematu; or pull it out with misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	But if the head comes out and is constricted at the clavicle, then let it be split until the moisture which is in the chest is poured out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it is not folded, nor does it obey for exit, then cut the head piecemeal, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	But if there is an abscess in the lower part of the belly, or if there is dropsy in it, then it is necessary that you perforate it until the moisture runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If however the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with the cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and split the belly or chest until that which is in them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	Therefore if the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand into the depth of the womb, and with it seek the head, and draw it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb; then let her insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, because of a hot abscess which happens to it, then it is not necessary that labor should be performed on it, rather then it is necessary to administer the pouring of moist, oily things; and administer plasters; and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it may be straightened; then let that which we said concerning a living fetus be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	But if that is not possible, then let it be cut piecemeal, and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you leave nothing at all of the afterbirth inside.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	Therefore when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said concerning hot abscesses which happen in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	But if a flow of blood occurs, then let her descend into astringent waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I indeed already saw a woman, in whose belly a fetus had died; then she was impregnated above it by another time, afterwards another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long time an abscess happened to her in her navel, and it swelled until it opened; and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	Therefore I was called to her treatment, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore I placed on it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone came out of the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed for her, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	Therefore I was amazed at this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	Therefore I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	Therefore I examined the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and now she lived in this way for a long time, and a little pus is discharged from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not establish this extraneous matter here, except because in it is knowledge, and help for that which a skillful physician manages with his hand in treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Concerning the forms of instruments necessary in the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of a constrictor, by which books are bound, which has two equally sized heads at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this head ought to be more slender than the constrictor; and it ought to be made either of ebony or boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the width of each piece of wood be about two fingers; and the edge of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed in both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two heads.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the head by which the matrix is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, more slender, and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is about a palm: and the width of each is two digits.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	Therefore, when you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her legs hanging down, open what is between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two joined additions into the matrix: and you are holding the lower extremity of the instrument between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount you wish of the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The shape of another kind of speculum than the ancients described, the shape of a pusher by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The shape of the Almisdac, with which a large head is crushed: and it is similar to forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made oblong, like forceps according to this shape, as you see, which has teeth like saw teeth, by which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The shape of the Almisdac with which a small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The shape of a hook having one point.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The shape of a hook having two points.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The shape of forceps which has saw teeth, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of two broad spatulas also.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are practiced, and the more their types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work, and the more highly regarded among men, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, but let them be prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Concerning the extraction of the afterbirth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you ought to instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it comes out by this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid; and put into it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamus, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and seseli, and cassia wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and put them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed tube over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end into the mouth of the womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the afterbirth will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or mallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then let her insert it into the vulva, and search for the afterbirth with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she has found it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is attached deep in the womb, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and draw it out gradually according to the straightness, so that the womb does not fall with violent pulling: rather it is necessary that it be moved with ease to the right and left sides: then let the amount of traction be added.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For then it obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with medication from a pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself over it in repeated extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Truly it is necessary that what comes out to the mouth of the womb from it, be tied to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then give her a clyster with tetrapharmacon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it putrefies, an evil odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak woman.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, suitable fumigations ought to be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients, however, have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated in the retention of the secundines and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made of glass similar to an alembic, or of copper; and let the wide end be placed over the fire; and let the fumigation be placed upon the coals: let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed; and repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their anuses are imperforate, which a subtle membrane has already closed.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore it is necessary that the midwife perforate that membrane with her finger; and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp spatula; and let her beware of the rectum, lest she touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place wool soaked in wine and oil upon it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now there has occurred an obstruction of the anus also from the healing of a wound, or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore it is necessary that that consolidation be cut, then treated with what we have said of treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter Eighty.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower part, are a knotting, and a swelling which occur near the anus externally: or in the space of one part: and it is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that knotting becomes old, it is opened, and a watery white moisture, or thin pus, flows from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore penetrating ones are recognized by that which comes out with the evacuation, and flatulence, when the sick person uses evacuation: and perhaps worms come out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are some of these fistulas which when they are in the space penetrate as far as the bladder, and as far as the urinary passage.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And some of them penetrate as far as the hip joint, and as far as the coccyx.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	Now, what distinguishes a fistula penetrating to the anus from one that is not, is that you insert your index finger into the anus: and insert a slender probe into the fistula made of air, or iron: when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a slender lead probe, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	But if you do not feel it completely, nor does anything proceed from the opening from excretion, nor flatulence, nor a worm as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula penetrates to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus: then its indication is the exit of urine from it, and the prevention of its consolidation in this place with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If, however, it penetrates to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no tortuosity in it to the bone: and the finding of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always exits from it: and that medication is not effective in it, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is absolutely no cure: and their cure is labor and vanity for the foolish physician upon whom it is performed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that which is not penetrating, and not old, healing is hoped for with a saw: according to what I relate to you, and I have already proven: and it is, that the infirm person lies between your hands on his back: and you raise his legs above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe arrives.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if the infirm person feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you introduce your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	Therefore if you feel the probe has already penetrated by itself, detected by your finger, besides what you feel between your finger and the fistula itself, or flesh: then therefore you know certainly that it is penetrating: therefore do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, they have said that in some men the flesh is healed, and of the medication by which help is hoped for it, it is, that you apply a fine cautery according to the size of the fistula, as preceded, and you introduce it burning into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat it twice, or three times, until you know that all those added filtered fleshes, which are similar to a bird's quill, have been burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, until those burned fleshes come out: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it is never healed with another treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if a probe emerges, and does not reach your finger, which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick covering of flesh or fat, and you see a fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the probe which is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered pieces of flesh, which resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing of them remains.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation so that you cut those pieces of flesh, then it is better, and of speedier help, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because cauterization with fire brings together good conditions, the burning of those added pieces of flesh, and the staunching of blood, and the drying of humors.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, or with crushed cabbage leaves, until the place discharges pus, and those burned pieces of flesh come out in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which generate hard flesh: and these are medicines in which there is astringency and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then it is healed: and you do not fear a recurrence.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and extends from the superfluity of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a probe, and between you and it is a membrane of fat or flesh, and it is near penetration: then there is no operation in that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because one of three methods is administered in it: either to cauterize it, as we said: or to cut it, until you obtain its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert lint, and treatment from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed far with the incision, lest you cut the muscle containing the anus, and it happens to the patient that there is an involuntary discharge of excrement.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps indeed it will heal: or you will lengthen that membrane, and cleanse it after you cut it almost to the anus, as we said, either with a probe, or with another instrument of a sharp end.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered  fleshes which are in the incision, as far as you can with exploration.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of the whole wound with suture, and the upper opening where it consolidates: and a fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes a fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take a probe of a perforated end, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, of those preparing leather, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it penetrates into the margin of the anus internally nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together: and tighten each, and leave it for one day, or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those flesh parts which are between the two ends of the thread are cut, and fall away: then treat the wound, until it consolidates, and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not in your power to do that because of the muscle, so that you do not cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of a spatulite probe with which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For they are either within the anus, similar to bladders of coals, or plums; or as if they were themselves grape seeds.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And of these there are small ones and large ones: and blood always flows from them, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those which are outside the anus are, for the most part, of little moisture, from which flows a yellowish water, or a little blood with a constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is within the anus is that you order the patient to strain; and it is pressed out until it emerges from the anus, and the athelil appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, also suspend it with hooks; or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then incise them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if the hooks do not hold them, because of their moisture and softening, then take them with a rough cloth, or with a pledget of wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then incise them, and sprinkle on them after incision some warm powders, that they may stand in place of a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	But if the anus does not obey evacuation, then give the patient an enema in which there is a little bite, so that what is in the anus may be washed out with it, and obey evacuation quickly, when the patient strains himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their matter is light, easy: and it is that you take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and incise them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever shrinks from incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a rolled thread, and insert it into a needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw the hemorrhoid upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be lateral: and bind the hemorrhoid with a strong constriction.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and withdraw the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and leave one of them: nor compress it, so that a superfluity of blood may flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over the anus a cloth infused in rose oil, or cerate, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Concerning the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For they often happen from the dryness of the stool and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become chronic and medicine is of no use in them, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula, or with your nail, until they become moist, and the upper layer which prevents them from healing is removed from them.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them until they heal as is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they do not heal, then repeat the scraping with greater force than the first time, until they bleed much and are excoriated; then treat them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted haemorrhoids, and dry fissures, and fistulas.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that a haemorrhoid is nothing but a round nodule, the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail; and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and pain from them occurs during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore it is necessary that what is around the nail be cut, and held with forceps or with a hook, and eradicated from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From dry athelil, however, there is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is that you extend the athelil and incise it: or tie it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously stated with fire, or with a sharp medicine: and now inverted athelil, and non-inverted, are eradicated with the instrument which I shall describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	An ant, however, is also a small, filtered, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when cold finds it, something similar to the bite of an ant is felt in it, and it occurs throughout the body: and it occurs most often in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is that you take a small tube from a goose quill, or a strong vulture quill: and place that tube over the ant, until the circle of the tube contains parts of it.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then roll your hand with the tube until you cut what is around the ant: and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do that with a bronze or iron tube, according to this method.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the top of the tube be of a height that draws a rolled-up deafness, so that its grip on the finger and its rolling are eased.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was mentioned previously in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Concerning the forms of instruments which are used for clysters in illnesses of the anus, and for the loosening of the bowels, and for colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast bronze, or of hammered bronze.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made from these instruments, small and large, according to those in whom they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small: and whose anuses are weak, or painful, so also their clysters.
Clistere magnum.	A large clyster.
Cistere paruum.	A small clyster.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube, that is, the upper end to which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner: and let it have a distinction so that the bag may be tied as you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, very smooth, tapering to a point: and on one of its sides let there be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker, and let the bag in which the medicines are placed be of an animal's bladder: or of sheepskin, which should be in the form of a small asofrat; whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let it be perforated with many holes as it is rolled up, and let the space which is between each hole be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread of raw thread, which is of ten threads, or thereabouts, and tie with it the bag like an asofrat.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore the bag is placed in it, let it be tied at the head of the clyster between two distinctions with a strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then clysterize with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle of the bags here depicted, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	Moreover, the quality of clysterizing with it is: that you fill the bag or bladder with medicine, which is heated according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and beware lest it be very hot, or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then let the patient be laid on his back, and let him raise his legs upwards; and place under him an inthaan, that is, a hide upon which men lie, or a cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus easily.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant take the bag with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully until he evacuates all that is in the clyster into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	But if the medicine causes him to evacuate, then let him retain it as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more effective in helping.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you give him a clyster for ailments of looseness of the bowels, and its evacuation is rapid, then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	But if there are haemorrhoids in the anus, or harmful abscesses, then let the clyster be very fine, gentle, of the kind used for clystering children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a fine clyster over which the skin is tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the division concerning the treatment of wounds which was appropriate to the book, and I shall here describe their treatment by hand and with medicines according to what is fitting.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore the things by which wounds are made are many times such as the throw of a stone: or the incision of a sword, or a knife: or a blow with a lance, or a stick, or an arrow: and similar things from many objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Moreover, wounds which are made according to the places of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or neck, or breast, or belly, or liver: and similar members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may place that reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: because the recollection of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound happens in the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throw of a stone, or similar things, and it has now broken only the skin: and it is a large wound, and you fear concerning the unfortunate outcome of a hot abscess: then hasten, and immediately phlebotomize the cephalic vein: and do not delay it: and draw from him blood according to the amount of his strength: if nothing prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood which exits from the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient beware of repletion, and wine, and coarse foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if something prohibits bloodletting, then let him reduce [his intake] from food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place on the wound, if a hot abscess happens to it, a cloth infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are secure from a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I shall relate shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place on it certain ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or is from the incision of a sword, and similar things: and its lips do not come together by powders, then bring them together with suture, according to what I shall relate in wounds of the belly concerning their suture.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound is already detached from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspensory: then incise it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient that he be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge: and things similar to them.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	But if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then incise all the putrefied part, and throw it away: then treat it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	Therefore if you find it uncut, then cut it with a Spatula, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if necessity demands when that which we have said does not help, then cauterize it, until the bleeding stops.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, light: so that you sprinkle on them this powder: because it consolidates them before the air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of incarnative powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: let the whole be ground very finely, and sifted: and let the wound be filled with it, and bound tightly, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it above with powders, and leave it, and do not unbind it while it remains, so that it does not fester.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes the lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood at hand; and the lime also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is appropriate to put it on and bind them, and they are fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if the air has already altered them in some way, especially in summer, then this powder is not indicated: therefore treat it with what we have said, so that you put some digestive ointments on them: or put barley flour poultices, made with water and honey, on them, until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	But if a fracture occurs with the wound in the bone, and it is small, then extract it with a Gesti; and I shall now describe the treatment of head fractures in what is to follow.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Concerning wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment and that of a head wound when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is nothing to be done except to avoid treating it with something that produces strong stypticity, such as ziniar and zegi, and things like them.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the wound at all, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most superior of the members; and let that which heals it be from mild medicines, such as lime washed with fresh water infused several times with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with fresh water; and the other mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then administer a suture; or draw together its lips with powders.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the wound is deep, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus is already collecting, then perforate it in the most depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	But if an artery has been cut in the wound, and a flow of its blood has resulted, then separate or cut it and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity demands it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the vertebrae of the throat, or the whole thing, have been cut, and the al-haudegi have been saved, then bring together the edges of the skin with a suture over the tube of the throat, and do not touch the throat, but level it and restore it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments which have astringent and drying properties, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then examine it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can: and what is not ready, leave it, until the wound putrefies, and its discharge is separated and lessened.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder which I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with that whose mention came in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Concerning a wound in the shoulder blades.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a wound from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	Therefore if air escapes from the wound when the sick person breathes, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	But if it is not deep, and is fresh with its blood, then do not at first put powder in it, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depth and return to the heart and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	However, if you do not have ointment, then place old linen in the opening of the wound, so that it may absorb what comes out of it in terms of moisture; and cause the sick person to sleep on the wound, so that what collects in it may flow out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if three days or more have passed since the wounding, and the patient has not experienced a spasm, nor a bad trembling of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see his other conditions to be good, then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it with linen bandages and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	But if its healing is delayed, and it always opens up, then know that a fistula has now formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what preceded concerning suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has made an impression on the bone, and fragments have fallen from it: then probe the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	However, if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction is then easier.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment in the treatment of other wounds occurring in the other members is the same as that which we have spoken of.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestine, and their treatment.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture which happens to the abdomen is great, moderate, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore, from a large one sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, protrude.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore their replacement and suture is more forceful and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small rupture is also made difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows therefore that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten in their replacement to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and thickened: wherefore its entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a medial rupture is better: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the vein is according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the abdomen, and for the suture of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures are proper to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper to the suture of the abdomen: and I will tell you each one with explanation and clarification.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out of it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then it is because of one of two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the coldness of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is so, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with squills, and cyperus, and spica, and bathe the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does this: and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow, or marshmallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by it its entry is eased with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if its return is impeded after this treatment, then incise a little in the rupture, with the instrument with which haemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than incision: and constraint to incise is not done after necessity and failure of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the subtle extremity not be with the subtlety of a spatula, but rather be somewhat blunter: and it is that which is similar to a cautery, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	Therefore when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own proper place, if it is possible above it: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When however the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your intention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which is the wound be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make so that there is present between your hands a pious minister, who holds the whole rupture with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it to him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the manner of the common suture of one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then leave from the extremity of the rupture the quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix one needle besides which you insert thread in the two extremities of the skin, with the two extremities of the sifac which is under the skin from the insides, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the sifac: and four rows are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with double thread around the needle several times from the two parts together, until the two lips of the wound are brought together with a decent joining.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix in them another needle: afterwards tighten it with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do that with as many needles as you need, until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness: because thin needles cut the flesh very quickly; and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: therefore it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in two extremities of the skin that are very close: lest the flesh be quickly cut, and the wound be opened before its consolidation, and they are not lengthened with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the ends of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient in his sleep: and put on them little cushions of cloth on every side, which hold the ends of the needles: and leave them, until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And indeed this kind of suture with needles is more suitable in small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because one needle, or two, or about that many, suffice in their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second suture however is common, so that you join together with the suture four extremities: two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the fascia in one place, with a needle in which is wound a thread equal in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, return the needle from the part from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is, like the seam of cloth by which cloths are sewn together, and place between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	And this suture men know.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I sewed a wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than one palm: and there protruded from the intestines about two palms of the middle intestine, and the disruption was in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore I replaced it after its intestine had stood outside the wound twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	Therefore the wound was consolidated in the space of about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived after that many years, living according to his own nature.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor any medicines, were to be found.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore I placed old linen on the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	But I will describe two kinds of sutures proper to the subject.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	Therefore when the needle penetrates the skin, and the muscle running according to the length and breadth of the whole body: leave the end of the sifac on the side into which you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside at the other end of the mirach.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this way at the same end of the mirach from the outside to the inside: and leave the end of the sifac, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration by which you make it penetrate in the sifac at the end of the mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates the whole thing.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end which is from the sifac on the other side, and draw the needle out of the skin which it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then return it to that skin, and sew the end of the sifac, which is on the other side, with this end of the mirach: and draw it out of the skin which is on its side, and do that once, and again: and do it turn after turn, until you sew the outside completely according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that you sew the suture of the leatherworkers as they sew leathers: so that you sew the sifac once from one side with one end of the skin: and that you leave it another time from another side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of proper suture, which Galen mentioned.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	His speech is reported, that you sew it according to the likeness in which certain mediciners sew them, so that they bring together each part to its corresponding part agreeing by nature: and apply the end of the sifac to its other end, and the end of the mirach to its other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you fix the needle in the end of the mirach near you from the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that alone: and leave the two ends of the sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two ends of the sifac, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both, also make them penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other ends of the mirach, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is the suture whose mention preceded.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also the word of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the abdomen is straightened with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, you insert one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew hides equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suture is more difficult than that of the other parts of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the medication of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you obtain a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and its own, and fit it: then put on incarnative powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	But if the air has already altered the wound, then put on it certain ointments which are present to you, until they produce pus; and the threads fall out, and the sifac and mirach consolidate.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if medicines are not present to you, then immediately put on it, from when it begins to emit pus, old lint; and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medication in most instances, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you fear that the wound will communicate with the principal members in injury, then it is necessary that you submerge soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil; and put it in the area around the groins and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	But if it feels pain, or prickling, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens), then administer an enema with warm, black, astringent wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and has become an exit penetrating to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and that which is from the small intestine, of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	Moreover, the intestine which is called the jejunum, does not receive healing from a wound which happens to it at all: and that is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the wound is an intestine, and you obtain it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, a space has passed, and it has become green or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with thread above the place which is blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not happen.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in an intestine there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then incise that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the traction of it, and the extraction of it in the case of the intestine, and the emission of the pus of the wound, may be relieved for you.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Concerning a wound which happens in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture happens in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it is restored in some men: therefore, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a blow of a lance, and the wound was from the right of the stomach, and the wound was old: and a fistula was made, and an evacuation and flatulence came out of it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until it was healed, and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the patient, that some bad accident might happen to the patient in his belly: and no bad accident happened to him from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and he entered the bath, and he exercised in his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some experienced men have said that when a wound happens in the intestine, and it is small: then it is necessary that it is tied according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you take ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one of those ants which have an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore it seizes upon it, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere, and not become loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease doing that with ant after ant according to the quantity of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm at all happens to the patient.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible that the intestine may also be tied with a fine thread: which has been cleaned from an animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is so that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is much thinned.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into a needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then return it into the rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with ants and intestine, is only according to a way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy except reduction, nor is its healing at all complete.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Concerning the treatment of Zuchamen and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound or abscess when it grows old and becomes ancient, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and is not excised: then it is universally called, in whichever member it may be, a fistula, and we call it Zuchamen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula indeed is, according to the truth, a filtered, hard, white knot; with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather: and on account of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in some hours moist, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is split in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little; and it is thick, and it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I already premised in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which is not healed, nor does flesh grow in it, is not that except because of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of its bad quality: or because between it, and upon its lips is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh: or because there is much dirt and filth: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter which is discharged from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment: or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or through a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which the digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the healing of abscesses is delayed in it by nature: or because in it is one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I already showed all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that fistula happens in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For among them are fistulas which reach to the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sifac: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the compound joints in their composition: such as the hand, and the foot: and among them are those which go to the proximity of a principal member, and similar things.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, whichever of these fistulas is according to this manner, is of the illnesses difficult of healing, and does not receive a cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if there is some fistula whose depth does not reach these places which I mentioned: and you hope, and are confident in its cure, and wish to arrive at the knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze, or iron, if the fistula extends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of thin lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, with the softness of its body, is alleviated, and is bent around the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	But if the fistula has many orifices, it is not possible for you to probe it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, inject a clyster into one of its orifices.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you inject a clyster goes towards the other orifices, and flows out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then diligently inquire in whatever way is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the cavity of the fistula is distant or near; or whether it is one fistula which has many orifices, and attend to all that with the greatest strength of yours: with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and with the discovery of pain upon compression with your hand on the place, and with similar signs and causes happening to the abscess.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have attended to all those things truly, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and it is that you consider then if the fistula is near, apparent, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then cut the fistula as has been premised in my account, and remove what is in it of pus, and corrupt flesh, which grows in its orifice from flesh or thelul, and the like; and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you cut it deeply as much as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply linen cloths wrapped in sharp medicines: and introduce them up to the cavity of the fistula which you have reached with the iron: do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it is not healed by that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is confirmed for you: then investigate it, and cut it according to what I have told you: if nothing prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore bone is discovered, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which causes it to grow flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	But if it is not healed, and it emits pus as it did before: then know that you have not arrived at the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Then investigate it again, and meticulously perform its scraping, and cleansing with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If therefore it heals, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a distant depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	But if a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones, then skillfully perform the extraction of them all, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	But if something of the humors opposes you, and there is no fear or mistake in incising them, then incise those humors and the flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then apply something to the wound that will cause it to putrefy: and leave it until that which is around those bones of flesh and humors has putrefied.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And keep the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the incision which you made in your operation be constricted.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Rather, if you are afraid, place upon it a lint that has been soaked in crushed sulfur with oil: or lint soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humors putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction will be easier.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if there is one large bone, such as a bone of the leg, or a hip bone, and similar to those, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the last method until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if that which is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it entirely to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you, a thing which happened to a man in his leg: that you may put it as an example and help for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a man, young in age, about thirty years old, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause which moved upon him within the body, that is, from the interior parts, until the materials reached the leg, and it became an abscess with a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore a time was spent with him in error by the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many materials flowed from it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And the treatment of it was delayed, until the leg became fistulated, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus and the humours of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of surgery among them, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials which ran from those openings in great quantity: indeed the whole body of the man was now wasted, and his colour was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to communicate with each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I therefore prepared, and cut above one of those openings, until I uncovered part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was now eroded, and blackened, and putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Therefore I sawed what was revealed to me, and prepared [it] from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I judged that there was in the bone only that corruption, which I cut away and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried, and uncovered the bone a second time above the first uncovering: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me also of that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore I uncovered it again, and did not cease cutting the bone piece by piece, and trying its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut from the bone about one palm, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and healed: and this iteration in its operation, and section of it, was not necessary, except because of the disposition of the weakness of the patient, and the smallness of his tolerance, and my fear for him of death: because there happened to him at all hours from the superfluity of evacuation bad fainting spells.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore he healed with a complete healing: and there grew in the place of the bone hard flesh, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he behaved in his dispositions: and it did him no harm at all in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if a protruding bone in the body is already broken: then it is necessary that you bind it, according to this method: and it is: that you take a ligament, and bind it to the extremity of the protruding bone: and order someone to pull it upwards: and put another thicker ligament of wool on the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood, or a board, under the bone below decently: because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting corrupt flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupt place a little, so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compels another sawing in its place.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	But if the bone is corrupt, and is not protruding, but rather a part of it is continuous with a part: and the corruption is in its middle, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood underneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued from the other part: and let the sawing be according to the length from the corruption a little, according to what we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	But if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupt joint itself, and saw the bone where it is continuous on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	But if the corruption is in the back of the hand, or in the back of the foot: then the matter is very difficult in it.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Truly it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And abrade it, and clean it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever instrument is rectified for you: when it does not oppose you, vein, or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their subtlety, and their magnitude, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument suitable to that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have long study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art, a witness to the methods of illnesses: then indeed you will find by yourself that which is suitable to it from the instruments for every infirmity.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will place as examples on which you will cut, and a test by which you will experiment on others.
Forma Serrae.	The shape of a saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This depicted saw shape, let it be properly made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arc be made of iron sharpness, and its handle of boxwood, and let it be pyramidally and properly made.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of a joint rasp.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this rasp be according to the form of the head of a star nail; and let its points be according to the form of the points of an  elschetfegi.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable except that the heads of joints are rubbed with it when they are corrupted, or a bone is large and great.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of a larger rasp.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of a medium rasp.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of a broad rasp.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of a rasp in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of another, fine rasp.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of another rasp with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of a small, thin, slender rasp.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of a rasp with which bones are incised.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Also the form of a large rasp.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a saw, and the end is like a saw; it is shown in many places for the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of a rasp which is suitable for rasping that which has been perforated from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, of sharp points.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made of Indian wood.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly it is necessary that all those things which we have spoken of be made from rasps, and incisors, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Extremities putrefy, either from an external or an internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the cure does not help, and you see the corruption cutting into the member, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you incise that member as far as the corruption extends, so that the sick person may escape death, or a worse evil which is greater than the loss of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this happens is that the member blackens until it seems that fire has burned it, or it putrefies after the blackness, until that putrefaction is incised to where it follows that member, and creeps into the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the striking of certain poisonous things: such as a sea scorpion, and a viper, and a whelk, and similar things.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	Therefore if the corruption or blow is in the extremity of a finger, then incise the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, so that it may proceed to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then incise it from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold in the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades it, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption passes through, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the death of the sick person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that in treatment, is a matter of skill.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then incise it at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the instep, then incise the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends to the knee, then incise the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except giving up, and leaving the sick person to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of incising a limb, or sawing it, is to constrict the ligament below that which you wish to incise; and constrict another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let an assistant extend one ligament downwards; and let another assistant extend the other ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then let it be incised, or sawn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw not touch the healthy place; and there will happen to the sick man an added injury, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if internal bleeding occurs while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly; or place upon it some powders that stanch blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded member with a bandage suitable to it, and care for it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you that which happened to a man in his foot, the same accident that I relate to you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	Which is, because there happened in his foot a blackness, with a burning which is similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption at first happened in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man hastened of himself, after he saw the corruption increasing in the member with its vehemence, that which he found from its pain, and burning: and he cut it off at the joint, and was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed for him, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with what I put on his hand from medicines after cleansing his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to proceed into another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	Therefore he called me, to cut off his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from myself concerning the repulsion of that excess: and I also feared for him concerning the cutting off of his hand death.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's strength was beyond the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and it came to me concerning him, that he hastened, and cut off his whole hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not brought this narrative, except that it may be a help concerning that which falls under the kind of this illness: and that it may be a signification by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be treated.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Concerning the care of sinuses, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it breaks or is perforated, and that which is in it of pus goes out, and a hollow place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth which has been thinned: and it does not reach the ultimate in its corruption, nor does it affect bone, nor nerve, nor ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until the corruption affects any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its cure is, that you incise that whole skin as it is rolled up: and especially when it has been thinned, and made like cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you suspect that the skin adheres, and that ultimate corruption does not follow from it: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster: and it is, that you should consider the Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus which is emitted from it is foul-smelling: then clysterize it with the Egyptian medicine, which is of vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, they are mixed in a vessel: and they are boiled over a fire, until the medicine reddens: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take of it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the Sinus with it: and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then draw it out by expression: do this for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is clysterized with wood ash water, when you do not have this medicine present: and it is, that you take the ash of vine wood, or ash from holm oak wood: and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now washed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	But if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the wood ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey, to which something of crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clysterize him with mixed honey and wine, because it is of the property of honey to cleanse and wash; and wine causes adhesion to the sinus, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has now been removed: then clysterize him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take of diafinicon plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or clysterize him with certain other medicines and ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	But if the orifice of the sinus is constricted, so that the clyster cannula does not enter: then enlarge it slightly with iron; or place in it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring its lips together with a suture: and leave of it an amount into which a clyster may enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice from which pus runs is elevated to the upper parts: then cut it in a lower place which is in it, so that the pus may run from it downwards: because pus, when constricted in the depth of the sinus, prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around its lower part as you wish: then try to prepare the member with a preparation by which pus may run from it easily as it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take consolidating medicines which are placed on the sign, suitable for that which you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a quantity that the whole sinus may be communicated.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors in a straight line with the opening of the sinus a hole, a little larger than the opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it at a distance from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be relieved: and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days at one time.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But the one which is over the opening of the sinus, is the one which you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from pus may come out: and so that you may know whether what flows from it is much or little virus, or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the place of the sinus itself, whether its lord feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or there is no abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your medication is extended in this way, and you see the matter which comes out over the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus now adheres, or is approaching adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if a subtle virus comes out of the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and of them there are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if undigested pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed, and its matter is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, what physicians do, so that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their virtue: such as diafinicon ointment, when an excess of addition from zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And of the last things by which it is cured, is that you take diafinicon ointment, and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it old wine equal in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does something similar to this, when you do not have diafinicon ointment at hand, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread over it a cloth, and bind it over the sinus: and spread with the honey which you boiled, until it thickened: and powder over it spices, and place over it a cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes there is administered in it long birthwort, and roots of the lily of the sky, and there is lily: and herb flour, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or compounded, grind them, and sift them: and powder over the honey which I have told of, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if the matter of the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment: then know that in its depth is corruption: or it already makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, according to what has been premised.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Concerning the treatment of whitlow and a rubbed nail, and the incision of an added finger, and section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Whitlow is an abscess which arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it arises in the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	Therefore, when its matter is prolonged, and its cure is neglected, and it becomes inflamed with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you treat it, with what we said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you incise with an iron all the excess which remains of the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cautery is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail already compress the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin probe under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards: and incise that flesh easily, and place on what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until the whole of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	But if the corruption already penetrates into the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone, and extract it: for it is never healed while the corrupted bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	But if you see corrosion and corruption advancing in the finger, then incise it at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	But if there should happen to be an abrasion or a blow to the nail, and intense pain occurs, then it is necessary that you first bleed the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula with a transverse cut from above downwards.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause very intense pain to the patient, and it will be the cause of the growth of added flesh in the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with that which soothes pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	Moreover, the added finger which is born on the hands of some men, perhaps is wholly fleshy; and perhaps in some of them there are bones, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them are born at the root of a joint, or its origin is in certain knots of a finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, that which is born in certain knots of a finger, is not moved; and that which is born at the joint of a finger, perhaps is moved.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the cutting of that one which is fleshy among them is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the treatment of that whose origin is at the root of a joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore abstain from its incision.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	However, in that which is born in a finger at the last knuckle, then it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a round incision down to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Now, the consolidation which happens to fingers together, very often happens either from a person's birth, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary that you separate that consolidation, until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them linen cloths, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them; or place between them a thin lead plate, until the place consolidates as it ought.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if consolidation happens to some fingers with the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Concerning the incision of a vitiated part.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Varices are convoluted veins, thick, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many members of the body; and their occurrence is most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and labor, and carry burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary that you administer a shaking of the body from black bile, sometimes with a strong shaking.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then, bleed the patient in the basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein is raised, and the whole thing is drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	Its incision is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First bathe the leg with much warm water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of his hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise, that is, draw out the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and the phlebotomist ought first to raise the patient's leg.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the vein downwards until a quantity of blood comes out which you see is sufficient, and which the patient's strength can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods which produce black bile; and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	Its elevation is in this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the patient's leg if there is much hair on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then put him in a bath; or rub his leg with warm water until it reddens and the veins swell; or let him take vigorous exercise, if a bath is not available, until the limb is warmed.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin lengthwise directly over the vein; either at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and strip the vein bare on all sides until it appears clearly: and at its appearance, you will see it red, tending towards blackness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it is freed from the skin, you will see it white, like a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert a spatula under it until it is raised and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another incision about three fingers' breadth from that incision.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise it with spatulas as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need it.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then raise it, and incise it with the last incision near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the incision which is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you pull it out from the incision which is higher, or higher than all the incisions, until when it comes out entirely: then incise it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you to be pulled out and raised: then insert a needle with strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert a probe under it: and turn your hand to every part, until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware that it is not incised.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is incised, it becomes very difficult for you to raise it, and harm enters the patient from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when you have pulled it out entirely: then place on the place of the wounds wool submerged in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it, until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	But if the piece of vine is contracted, having a tortuosity to which there is a winding to the parts, and is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you split it at every part of its tortuosity, and the places of its winding.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks, until you raise it entirely: and beware in your incision upon it lest you cut a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to raise, or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of the incision by which the piece of vine is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of a blind hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor is it sharply pointed, so that it does not wound a vein: and it is of thick, gentle curvature: because if it were thin, it would cut a vein by its thinness: indeed, let it have superfluous thickness, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Algezira, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, of little softness, that is, in which grass or trees do not grow.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation indeed is from the putrefaction which happens under the skin, just as serpents and ascarid worms, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh, happen within bodies.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a strong inflammation happens in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place blisters.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that blister, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight is from one keil drachm to two drachms, and tie it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	As often therefore as something comes out of it to the exterior, wrap that in lead and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged much, then cut part of it, and wrap up the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root before it comes out completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters into the flesh: and it causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary that it be treated gently, and drawn out little by little, until it comes out to its end, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein indeed there comes out in some men that which is in its length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has come to me, that it came out from a man of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it is cut into during your treatment, then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long opening, along with the body, until all that is in it of matter is evacuated: and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore treat it, as we said in the division, and with that which was premised.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Concerning the incision upon worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine sickness.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This sickness is called in a certain land among us bovine sickness, because,  because it very often happens to cattle, and it is a small single worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes throughout the whole body, ascending and descending; and its movement from member to member is shown to the sense, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and snakes occur, that is, earthworms and ascarids, in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its malignancy.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it goes in the body and rises to the head and arrives at a place, then perhaps it opens there and emerges and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, then this is not done except at the time of its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore it is necessary that you bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut over it and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	But if it penetrates deep into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And what is more feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see it has already arrived at the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut over it and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body with medicines dissolving bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods generating putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Concerning the incision for the illness Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain which happens in certain members: then it is changed from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I indeed already saw it, according to what I relate to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained one hour, I saw one swelling proceeding with speed, as a worm proceeds, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it can be: so that it is like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore the pain departed from that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it arrived in the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she related to me that it was revolving in her whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore I was astonished at the speed of its change from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed I had not seen this illness before with my own eyes in this manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many who found pain shifting from member to member: and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is, except that it is because the woman was of those who are of the villages of dry bodies with exposed veins: hence therefore that shifting windiness appears to the senses.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, and hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish its cure, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to you by sight, as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly: and cut above it until that constricted windiness comes out: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your eyes: then cure it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels windiness, and removes it with foul-smelling pills, and pills of serapinum, and the like.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Concerning the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are diversified according to their kinds, and according to the places in which they fall in the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is this: for some of them have large and small points; and some are concave and some blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And some of them have three points.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And some of them have barbs.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And some of them have small points.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those, however, which are according to the members in which they fall, are of two kinds.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either the members are of the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and the like.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	Therefore when it falls into any of these members, and the signs of death, which I shall tell you later, appear to you, then you ought to avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in most instances.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when those bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and exits the dura mater which is above the brain, are: that there happen from it intense thirst, and dimness of vision, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white moisture similar to pus comes out from the place of the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And something like the watery part of flesh comes out of it.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs, however, of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and one feels with it as if it were fixed in something hard, not in something empty.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the motion of the pulse: and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And coldness of the extremities follows, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death approaches without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And a sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck become suppurated, and the color of the sick man changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a large, deep breath: and he seeks the intake of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	But if the arrow falls on the membrane which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and great shortness of breath occurs with intense pain, with sighing: and all the members of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food comes out of the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly, and is fixed in it: something of the excrement comes out of the wound, or pus, or intestine which has already been broken.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore there is no hope in his cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the patient: then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and armpit, and the vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to many dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery, or nerve: and the arrow is not poisonous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen of the nature of these arrows, that you may signify by that concerning your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because an arrow fell upon a certain man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell upon him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained from it only a small extremity, with which it adhered to its shaft: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with a soft iron head, in which there are no barbs.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore the Jew was healed, and no evil accident happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is one which has barbs.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore I made an incision upon it between two guide-strings: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	Therefore I carefully worked with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his abdomen: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After therefore thirty days had passed for him, and nothing of his condition had changed, I made an incision over the arrow: and I worked on it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no ill effect happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound had healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After therefore seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman into whose abdomen an arrow had fallen, and the wound had healed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and none of her condition changed, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound healed, and it remained, causing him not much pain: and many things similar to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had now deviated a little to the right side: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	Therefore I was called to his treatment after the arrow's impact for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Therefore I found the arrow wound very constricted.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	Therefore I searched for it with a slender probe, and did not feel it: and he himself found a prick and pain beneath his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	Therefore I hoped that that prick was from the point of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	Therefore I plastered the place with a plaster which had attractive and digestive power, trusting that the place would suppurate, and the sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut upon it: and there did not occur in the place an occurrence signifying that the arrow had reached the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore I persevered with the plaster upon him for many days: and no occurrence happened, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained ill from the extraction of it for a space of days, until on a certain day he felt the arrow within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it was opened: and when I probed it, I felt the thin point of the arrow which adhered to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound by that sharp medicine, until the point of the arrow appeared to us visibly: and about four months of time passed with me because of it.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield to exit: then I did not cease to refine, and devise concerning it with ingenious methods, until on a certain day I began upon it with decently made forceps, according to what their form will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the infirmity was healed with complete health: nor did anything at all harm him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I relate to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place that as a rule and meaning upon that which I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration: nor does the book comprehend that, and the prudent craftsman compares with a little concerning much: and with that which is present, concerning that which is absent: and finds a new operation, and a new instrument in the descent of extraneous things of this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not exit from the members to which they are fixed, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite of the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which exits from where it entered, is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is drawn, and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	But if it does not obey exit at the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it some days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its traction is lessened, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in a bone, and does not obey you for exit, then leave it also some days: and repeat it with traction and movement every day, until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	But if it does not obey you for exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone itself on every side with a thin drill, until the arrow is widened.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already proceeded into one ventricle of the brain, and some of those accidents which I have mentioned appear in the patient: then abstain from drawing the arrow, and leave it, until its being is equalized after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate as far as the sifach: and the patient remains for some days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him: then be ingenious in drawing the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed firmly, and does not obey you when you draw it: then apply a drill around the arrow, as I have related to you: then treat the place, until it is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow is now hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sensation: then search for it with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	But if you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments which are suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you cannot reach it, because of the tightness of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep within, and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then incise over it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	But if it has barbs by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them on every side, by every means you can, and by devices, if you cannot overcome the adhesion of the flesh in the barbs' fracture, and their twisting, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you cause it to come out: and the finest points with the finest subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you, and its removal.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	But if you cannot reach it within an hour, then leave it for a few days, until those things which are around it putrefy.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try again; for the swelling will be lessened. But if the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we said concerning treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer every possible means of removing the arrow: and let that be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that, when you pull out the arrow, you make the patient lie in the same position as he was when the arrow struck him.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more helpful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the positions.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But an arrow which emerges from the opposite side, or something of it already proceeds outwards: or the point of the arrow makes a swelling by sensation on the nearby upper part of the skin, and you see it prominent: therefore cut over it, and let the incision be of such a size that forceps can grasp it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it out: for it will then be easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow is embedded in the bone and widens itself; then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for a few days; then try again, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	But if the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the wood has fallen off, and you wish to administer a push: then introduce a concave instrument, so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow; then push it with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is lightened by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what is suitable for it.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	But if the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near to what you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the shape of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the ends be similar to a bird's beak, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many kinds are made of them, large and small and medium-sized, according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the size of the wound, and its narrowness.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the concave pusher.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of the blunt pusher.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is a blunt end like a radius, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased, and it is pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The end of this concave pusher is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entry of the arrow into it and its pushing are eased.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter 97.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins to be phlebotomized, whose custom has run in the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbae; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two lachrymal ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the tip of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins which are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins which are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	The veins, however, which are bled in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the outer side: and the common people call it the vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	And the dark one.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And there is the Median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic, and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And the Basilic, and it is situated on the inner side: and it is also called Titillicaris.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And the common people call it the vein of the belly.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And the rope of the arm, and it is situated above the forearm: and it is that in which bloodletting is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with clear application.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And the Salvatella: and it is a vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb from the outer side.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second is the Saphena: and its place is near the heel from the inner side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And the vein Nesse: and its place is near the heel from the outer side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	Phlebotomy of the two veins which are behind the ears, however, is a benefit for old catarrhs, and hemicrania, and sahafati, and old bad head ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of bleeding it is according to what I relate.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is so that the head of the sick person is shaved: and his occiput in the place of the two veins is rubbed with a rough cloth with a good rubbing.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then let the sick person bind his neck with a band, until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there mark with cautery.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take a lancet phlebotome, and it is that which is called Incidens.

Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with lint, and leave it until it heals.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And already the incision and cauterization of them preceded in the beginning of the book.

Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	Truly, the two arteries which are in the two times of phlebotomy are a help for old hemicrania, and bad toothache, and constant ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp effused superfluities to the eyes.

Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary that the phlebotome be of a sharp extremity, like the other phlebotomes, but rather of a broad extremity.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And phlebotomize it according to the transverse; because the bone is near; and perhaps in it the phlebotome will be broken when it is thin.

Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	Phlebotomy of the veins of the nose, however, is beneficial for acute fever, and violent headache, and facial illnesses, such as hemicrania, and redness which occurs in the face: especially when it is longstanding.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should constrict his neck.

Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long phlebotomy instrument; and insert it in the middle of his lip, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary that you should move your hand with the phlebotomy instrument a little; and you should make the blood flow according to your need.

Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And leave it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	Concerning the phlebotomy of veins, Algeberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	Moreover, Algeberich's phlebotomy is helpful because it contributes to canker in the mouth and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers also which are in the nose and in its circumference.

Then roll back his lip and look at the two veins: of which one is on the right of the lip and the second on the left of it; and the indication of both is by the blackness of both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And this is true: because in their circumference are small, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore incise each with an incisive incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then attend to the incision of the larger of them, and the more manifest of them.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed custom runs mostly with it: and incise the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Concerning phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Truly, the help of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for obstructions which are in the throat, and sickness of the uvula, and sicknesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the manner of phlebotomizing them is that the infirm person should sit between your hands before the sun: and raise his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein: and the color of each inclines towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore phlebotomize both: and be careful lest you wound your hand in phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries will happen.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	Now the three veins which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those in whose phlebotomy custom runs in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome: or an olive-shaped one to a sloping thinness: or by cutting with a knife-like phlebotome, and that is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is that which is suitable for section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And of them are broad species, and thin ones according to the width of the veins and their narrowness. The form of the myrtle phlebotome is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotome is of less width, and of a more slender point.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	Now the basilica, which is one of these three veins, is an aid to phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest, and the belly: and it befits the phlebotomist, when he phlebotomizes it, that he be cautious, and be on guard against it, for under it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore if he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will result.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a pointed phlebotomy instrument; rather, let it be cut with an Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	But if the basilica does not appear in manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you abandon it, and change to another, or seek some branch of it: or phlebotomize in its place the vein of the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is manifest, and cut it with the Alnesil phlebotomy instrument, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish the phlebotomy of the same [vein], then it is necessary before constriction of the arm, that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with a cautery, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with the Alnesil phlebotomy instrument, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware lest the incision fall through the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with the cautery, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	But if you see the blood at the phlebotomy leaping up, like the urine of a boy, and it is thin blood, red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore hasten, and put your finger on it for a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then bind the arm, and release it: and let the patient beware of its movement: and let him be in fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not move it for some days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood is not cut off, and it overcomes you: and you do not have medicine present at that moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of a pistachio, and split it; take one half, and bind it over the place of the constriction of the vein decently, with a bandage and pledgets until the next day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with that whose mention preceded from the place of powders cutting off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in most cases, because of the smallness of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the median basilic vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	Moreover, the benefit of phlebotomy of the median basilic vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that he be careful about its phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, numbness occurs in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not completely healed.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some men, and is thin, and is not shown: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy, by which you perform the phlebotomy, with an incision with an Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	But if the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Concerning the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Moreover, phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to the illnesses of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with an olive-shaped phlebotomy instrument, or with a myrtle-shaped phlebotomy instrument: because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Nevertheless it is fitting for you in phlebotomy, that you avoid with the phlebotomy instrument only the head of the humerus, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first incision, that it is repeated upon it with the phlebotomy instrument several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Nevertheless perhaps it becomes inflamed in some men when it is not phlebotomized in the first incision, but that inflammation does not harm it in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	Moreover, the quality of phlebotomy, and its accidental occurrences, in whose rectification it is necessary for you to think.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First therefore of that it is necessary that you know, that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health, and its perseverance, and caution from the arrival of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that phlebotomy be done in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Median, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that phlebotomy be done at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer: and in autumn and winter after a meal, when signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let phlebotomy be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Phlebotomy however which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined hour: but when suitability and necessity provoke it, at night, or by day, and at every hour, and at every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not fitting that boys be bled until fourteen years come upon them.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor let a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth month to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor let old men be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore when anyone wishes to be bled for whatever reason: it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if much retained stool is in them: lest the veins attract during phlebotomy from the bowels putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor let a patient suffering nausea, that is, a sickening fullness, be bled; nor one suffering from a hangover, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor one ill with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let phlebotomy be avoided again after a colic attack, and vomiting, and diarrhoea, and excessive intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and everything that weakens the bodily or animal strength.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him enter a bath, if nothing forbids it: or let him engage in some exercise, so that the blood may be thinned.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his phlebotomy in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said: and strive that his chest be evacuated on that day of all bad animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive intercourse, and the like.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present in his seat things with whose use the custom of men runs, from aromatics and fragrance, and dancing and similar things, in the quantity possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion which is higher than the cushion of the phlebotomized; afterwards let him pull out his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice, or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tighten the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, because when the constriction is unequal, or by excess in the constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood; or in softening, then also it prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction it is necessary that the phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins swell and are apparent to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then let the phlebotomist wipe the phlebotomized with a little old oil, properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself below the place where he wishes to phlebotomize, a little: so that the vein does not slip away, and the incision is missed.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because among the veins there is one which you find like a fleeing cord during phlebotomy: and among them there is one which is full of wind: and when you place the phlebotomized over it, it contracts under the phlebotomist, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is constricted: therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm, and be careful in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then let him put down the phlebotomized.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened at once, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it another time a little below that place, or above it quickly: if the place is not festering.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	But if it festers, or the patient is frightened, then leave him for a day or two days: and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps it will draw a hot abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him repeat the phlebotomy, if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	But if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly: and you fear that the quantity of blood you wish will not come out: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same hole according to the straightness, and add a little to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this quickly, before the place becomes abscessed, for an abscessed place is difficult in many men with a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	Therefore if you see it already abscessed, then do not repeat it at all, for it will excuse nothing for you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something of the dregs of oil on it: because it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomy, which phlebotomizes veins against the prohibition of blood flow: and they do this with theriac alfarach, and sagzenea, when one of them is placed upon the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	But if a large abscess happens at the place of phlebotomy, for it happens very often, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except at that time, or the opening of the vein is small, then hasten and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little: and bind it for an hour: because it is dissolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	But if something of blackness or greenness remains in the place after some days, it does not harm: and if you wish, put on it something of aloe, or dissolved myrrh: or something of the juice of mint, that is, calamint or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And very often indeed abscesses and swellings happen near the phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore put your hand upon it, then if you find softness in your compression upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Beware therefore, that you put upon it something of that which we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you extract from every man from the blood according to the quantity of his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it reddens: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it out until it is thinned: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein phlebotomy be widened, and the phlebotomy be wide: and in him who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he extract it in turns, and that the opening be narrow: and better that which is administered in vein phlebotomy is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of a nerve: and it is more laudable, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for whom it is accustomed to arrive at syncope during phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice: or sugarcane, if it is heated: and extract from his blood in three times, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in quince syrup, or in syrup of honey spiced with spices, or in fragrant spiced syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	But if syncope happens during phlebotomy, and its cause is the exit of much blood: then it is necessary that he take in drink meat water, and a subtle fragrant syrup: and he use aromatherapy with agarwood, and let his chest be anointed with it: and let him use the other things which we said in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But he who wishes to evacuate his arm, and to release his blood secondly: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he release blood gradually according to the quantity of strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But he who wishes to evacuate his arm, and to release his blood secondly, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven hours, or nine, from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	But he who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite of the part to which it inclines: it is necessary that he be evacuated on the second day, or on the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	But in whose body there is much blood already heated, and sharpened, and causes fever to happen: it is necessary that blood go out from it at one time, and a large quantity be drawn from it: and the opening be widened until syncope happens: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you put your hand upon his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not happen instead of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For often that happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence falls.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary, when you wish to release the arm, and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that it be pressed upon forcefully, and bent and extended quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very bad, indeed leave it until it is bled a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomy instrument that which is coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and put upon it something of salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place upon it something of theriac alfarob or sagapenum, and apply it with gentle compression, until the blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the vein is already inflamed, then leave it, and do not cover it, until the inflammation subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	But if necessity requires bleeding a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another vein in the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The rope of the arm is phlebotomized in the place of the Median and Basilic veins, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should put his hand into warm water until it becomes easily reddened and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it should be tied above it with a ligature, with moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then phlebotomize across it gradually, not laterally, nor lengthwise; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize it a little above the joint of the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	But if the flow of blood is prevented, then put the hand back into warm water, and let the blood flow into the water until you obtain what you need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if it is in the days of summer, then you are excused from putting the hand back into warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed, the flow of blood is mostly put into warm water in the winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy, however, of the Salvatella of the right hand, benefits liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the manner of its phlebotomy is that you bind the Salvatella of the hand with a ligature, or with your hand, after you put it into warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly shown.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then phlebotomize it transversely.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And take care not to cut your hand with the phlebotome.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers bared of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and will be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	Therefore, when you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not quickly clot.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly it is necessary that you do with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The help, however, of its phlebotomy from the left hand, is: because it is contributing to the illnesses of the spleen: and similarly do in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The help of the saphenous phlebotomy, however, is for illnesses which are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menstrual blood, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the manner of its phlebotomy is, that the infirm person puts his foot into warm water: and makes friction upon it, until the veins swell: and bind above the joint of the foot with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the place of the vein is near the heel, appearing towards the thumb: and many branches ramify from it in the surface of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore bleed it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its confluence: because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	But if you bleed it in the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are under it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And make your phlebotomy, by which you bleed it, transversely, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skillful.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the exit of blood is prevented, then bathe his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into it, until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	But if the phlebotomist misses the vein at the first attempt, then repeat with the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear any harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins, as we said, is near the heel on the outer side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for pain in the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the patient should enter the bath and hurry; and bind his leg from the side of the hip to above the heel with four fingers' breadth, with a long thin band; for it does not appear otherwise.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When therefore it appears, then phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you, or according to a transverse incision: and it is better, either to incise it with an incision, or to cut it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	But if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all: then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the dorsum of the foot, and towards the little toe: and beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood you wish flow.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction, and place a leather over the place of phlebotomy, and bind the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning cupping, and the manner of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cups are made from horns, and from bronze, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And cupping is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and the extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And there are fourteen places on the body where cuppings which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are applied.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	One of which is the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are the two sides of the neck on both sides together: and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades: and the cuppings of Alachosos above the end of the spine: and the cuppings of the two elbows, and they are the middle of the two arms: and the cuppings of the two legs: and the cuppings of the two ankles.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And cupping indeed does not draw blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that, strength does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it necessary that cupping, whether with fire or without fire, be administered in any illnesses which occur from repletion, until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	But if necessity prompts cupping because of illness or habit, we administer it at any time at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is because there are men in whom blood multiplies until it needs extraction by cupping; they find heaviness and headache in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And some of them find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And some of them find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And some of them scratch the place of their cupping.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And some of them have increased laughter.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth; or the tongue is abscessed, and they spit blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And some of them have increased sleep.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And some of them see in their sleep blood and redness, and slain men, and wounds, and things similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	Therefore, when we see something of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order venesection to be performed, after two or three hours of the day have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that it helps with heaviness in the head and that which flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	However, it is necessary that this be after evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this cupping is instead of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted that one of cold complexion, or in whom there is catarrh, use it.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it inflicts great harm on him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that, it is not necessary that the elderly use it, and those in whose head there are cold illnesses.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever is assiduous over it, forgetfulness is generated upon him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of that it is necessary that you instruct the cupper to put down his hand with the cupping glass a little to the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Cupping or Alkehel is in place of the median vein phlebotomy, and the basilica phlebotomy, and because of that it benefits asthma, and constriction of breath, and fissure of the instrument of breath, and cough, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the Alkehel cupping glass be applied a little, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Cupping of the alhagdahim, however, benefits pains occurring in the head, and ophthalmia, and hemicrania, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of the basilica phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not cut an artery, and a flow of blood happens.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Cupping under the chin, however, benefits canker sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar illnesses which are in the mouth: and it stands in place of the phlebotomy alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Cupping of the shoulder blades, however, benefits alchafacham, which is caused by repletion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Cupping, however, of the inner parts of the two ankles benefits the phlebotomy of the three veins, the basilica, the median, and the cephalic: because it itself draws blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh: and those small veins draw from other veins thicker than them, until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to proceed too much in scarification: because the place is denuded of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The cupping glass, however, which is cupped over the alchausos, benefits hemorrhoids of the anus, and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that the cupping glass be large, and that it be of metal: because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps thin cupping glasses will break: and let it be scarified with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Cupping glasses of the legs diminish visibly: because they draw blood from the whole body, and benefit old pains in the kidneys, and the womb, and the bladder: they provoke menstruation, and benefit boils, and ademenul: and they stand in place of the phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and the alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope to happen in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of cupping glasses of the alhorcobeni is close to the benefit of cupping glasses of the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the placement of cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass first empty, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors may come to the place with an equal arrival: and do not cease to repeat that and continue, until you see the place now redden and swell, and the redness of blood appear: then therefore scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is of men of tender flesh, of rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, not more: lest the place be ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the cupper to enlarge the scarification, and deepen it a little: and moderate the suction in ease, and speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	But if there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first instance indeed a way is opened for the thinning of the blood, and its watery part: and in the second indeed for the thorough examination of the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	But if the blood is very foul, then let a scarification be made a third time: that the last may be attained.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or little by little, one scarification suffices for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	But if we wish the extraction of much blood, we scarify with many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification: and the equal limit in scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which it is necessary to administer of oils at the application of cupping glasses, and what the cupped person should beware of.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	Indeed in him whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are constricted, it is necessary that the places to be cupped be anointed with opening, softening, resolving oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as is oil of alkeiri, or oil of violets, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or oil of sarbatine: and similar to them.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If however the superfluity is thick, cold: then let the oil be oil of marjoram, or oil of costmary or oil of henbane, or oil of dill: and similar to them.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If however the person to be cupped has large pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary that he be forbidden oil, and it is necessary that they wash the places of those cupping glasses after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with water of solanum, or with water of pumpkin, or with water of purslane: and similar to them.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But he whose blood is of much humidity, let him wash the cupping glasses with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach: and similar to them.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But he whose superfluities are thick, let him wash his cupping glasses with old wine, or with water of wormwood, or a decoction of dill, or chamomile: and similar to them.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that cupping be avoided in the bath, or immediately after the bath; indeed it is necessary that it be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that anyone sleep after cupping.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it by which the cupper, or phlebotomist, ought to be guided before cupping?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after it is necessary that you consider first: then if the cupped or bled person is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation prevail over his blood: then it is necessary that he take cooling things, such as pomegranate, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and succade, and julep: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put among his foods chickens, and the flesh of young sheep, and foods seasoned with verjuice: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new: and let him be instructed to use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put among his food chickens, and canebir; and sparrows, that is, small birds; and young pigeons he should eat.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting be more than food: and it is necessary that there be given to drink to some men in the hours theriac alfaroch, or a medicine of musk, that is, nutmeg, or alesselithe before cupping: and before bloodletting, or after: that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood thinned.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Concerning cupping without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Cuppings, however, which are without scarification, are cuppings which are placed upon the liver, and spleen, and gout, and upon the belly, navel, and the regions of the kidneys, and the hip joint: because these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And nothing is sought by them, except either a drawing of blood from a member to a member: just as we place a cupping glass upon the breasts in the illness of nasal bleeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to resolve from a member cold, trapped flatulence in a member: just as we place a cupping glass upon the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it itself rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes pain therefore, because it resolves that flatulence.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	Also it is placed upon the kidneys, when there happens in them obstruction, or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by virtue of its attraction perhaps it opens the obstruction, or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it acts when placed upon the liver and spleen with rubbing flatulence in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these cupping glasses are administered empty with only incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in illnesses of pleurisy: and that is so that the cupping glass is filled, and is large, with warm water alone, or water in which herbs that are suitable have been decocted.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of a cupping glass administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the size of its opening be two open fingers, according to what we have formed: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be in its side, in the place which is about its middle, a small hole, according to the quantity that a needle enters it: let it be made of bronze together, or citrine, of thick margins, smooth, even, taut: so that it does not injure the limb at its placement upon it: and let there be in its middle a transverse rod of bronze, or iron, where a candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this cupping glass is made large, larger than that which we have described, and a little smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For cupping glasses for children and thin people are different than cupping glasses for men and those with thick bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The method of placing this cupping glass with fire upon a limb is to light a linen wick with fire decently, or a small candle of wax: and place it upon the middle of the transverse rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass: so that the lit fire is around the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the body of the sick person is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then let it be placed upon the limb: and a finger should be placed over the hole which I mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glass; while we need it, we remove the finger, and the vapor will exit through that hole, and the cupping glass will be immediately removed.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the linen wick according to its manner, and repeat it, if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the cupping glass however which is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod, nor hole: and it is not administered, except that it is filled with water, and placed upon the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this cupping glass, the larger it is, so that it may hold much water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Concerning the application of leeches.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leeches are not applied in many places except in those members where the application of cupping glasses is not possible, because of their smallness, such as the lip and the gums, and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a member denuded of flesh, such as a finger and a nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the manner of using them is: that you take leeches which are in fresh waters, clean from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then let them be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then let the body be evacuated first with phlebotomy and with cupping glasses.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wipe the member of the sick person until it reddens.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards, let them be placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	Therefore, when they are full and fall off, and suction of the place with a cupping glass is possible, then it is most effective in helping; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and let it be rubbed and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	But if the flow of blood is prolonged after the falling off of the leeches, and it is still bleeding: then dip a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the bleeding stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the blood increases, then powder over it crushed alum, or galls, and similar things from among thestyptics, until the blood stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or let there be placed on the place halves of shelled beans: and let them remain until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood will be stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary, if a repetition of leeches is necessary, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if leeches are prevented from attaching, then let the place be wiped with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or prick the places with a needle until something of the blood comes out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then let them be applied, for when they sense something of the blood, they will adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	Therefore, when you wish them to fall off, sprinkle upon them something of powdered aloe, or salt, or ashes: and they will fall off immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A general discussion of restoration, dislocation, the treatment of torsion, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons, that foolish physicians and laymen boast of this chapter, who have never inspected the books of the ancients, nor read a letter from them.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it happens that this method is unknown in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I never encountered anything good in it, and I did not acquire from it what I acquired except through long reading of the books of the ancients, and study to understand them, until I extracted knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and study for the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described for you from it in this chapter all that my knowledge contains: and what my experiment has surpassed, after I have shortened it for you, and freed it from the burden of prolixity, and shortened it with the utmost brevity, and shown it clearly and concisely: and I have formed in it many forms of instruments which are used in it, as it is from the addition of precision, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections concerning the nature of bone fractures, those which are necessary to preface before we begin the discussion of broken limbs, and the different kinds of each.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this chapter, the summaries of the discourse, and the chapters, whose understanding the craftsman is compelled to attain first in order to stand upon their truth: namely, so that you, and those who are ready, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or sprain, or fall happens to someone, then it is necessary that you hasten first to bleed him, and to purge him, or both together: if nothing forbids it, such as weakness of strength; or if the one to whom one of these things happens is a child, or a very old man; or if it is a time of intense heat, or of intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, and the meat of birds and kids; and forbid wine, and strong meats, and being filled with foods and every food which fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until, when you are secure from a hot abscess, and you do not fear an effusion of matter to the limb: then let the infirm one return to his first regimen, with which his custom has run.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	Therefore, when a broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the infirm one be nourished with foods nourishing with much, thick, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from boiled wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish; and thick wine, and things similar to them.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the coagulation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in early old age, and decrepit, it is not possible that they are joined and consolidated according to their nature always, because of the desiccation of their limbs; and those which are in them at the end of softness are consolidated and joined, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Nevertheless, nature attaches to a broken bone from every part something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds it, until they are glued together, and bound together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you give the infirm nourishment of foods, in which there are heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the kinds of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs: because a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head: and a fracture of the bone of the chest is different from a fracture of the bone of the back: and similarly all the other limbs are all different from one another: and I came with a recollection of every kind of fracture expounded in its Chapter, distinct from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the kinds of bone fracture are also diversified in themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because its fracture is curved, besides that splinters occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes its fracture is according to the length of the bone: and its fractures are splinters, that is, splinters, and additions proceeding, such as are in a reed when it is sharpened with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and there is a fracture with a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And each kind has its own method or instrument in its restoration, according to what its remembrance will come, distinct in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that by which a bone fracture is known, is its crookedness, and its prominence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor sound on your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor does the infirm find great pain: then there is no fracture there, rather it is possible that there is crookedness, or a small fissure: therefore you ought not to move it with your hand and compression completely, rather place upon it of the medicines, of which the remembrance comes, after that moment which is suitable to the place: then let it be bound with a fine bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that the place when it is bent and split in two, besides that which happens in it by chance, truly every part is removed from its equal: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to its rectification, equalizing it before a hot abscess happens to it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for a few days, until the abscess rests.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to whichever way can be done with gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and its equalization is easier than of a bone in which chance happenings occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what will come to your mind concerning it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if there are chance happenings in the bone, then extension of this broken member from two parts is necessary, if it is a hand or foot; or with your hand, if the member is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position, in which you place the member, be on an even place, according to its natural form, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try to make those additions return to their places with all skill, and in whichever way you can; and beware, according to your strength, lest pain or injury happen to the weakened one through your operation; and try according to your strength to apply one of the two bones to its fellow, according to the best methods.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time that you try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it and equalize it according to the measure of your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of vehement extension and strong compression, as many foolish men do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For very often they cause by that operation of theirs a hot abscess, or a contraction in the member: as we have already seen that from their operations very often.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then, after the equalization and proper operation and the binding of that member, and rest and quiet, advise the patient about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him beware lest he move it at the time of his waking and his sleep in its turning and agitation, and in his evacuation, and all his movements with his utmost strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he beware lest the position of the member be a position with which pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain or injury in the arrangement of the position of the member, then it is necessary that you change it to another arrangement from that with which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with him, that its position be equal and straight, so that tortuosity does not occur in the member when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the binding of the broken member is as I relate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that broken members are diversified in their smallness and their size and their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, those of them which are small, such as the arm and finger and the little finger and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But those of them which are thick, such as the hip and leg, it is necessary that there be in them a broad, hard wrapping.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a broad ligature connects a large member and binds it on every side with an equal binding, so that no spot enters it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after your evacuation to place a suitable liniment on it, on soft lint over the place of its fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the ligature over the place of its fracture with three or four wrappings, according to what the member deserves: and tighten your hand a little with the ligature.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the part above the place of fracture, and bind less than was your binding with which you bound the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then lengthen yourself with the wrapping from the place of fracture a little, and soften the binding gradually, until you take from the healthy place a large part.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another bandage, and wrap it again over the broken place with wrappings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards go with the wrapping to the part below the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your work be in the binding of the wrapping, and the softening of it, according to what we said in the first upper wrapping.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the wrappings some soft tow, or cloth, with which the crookedness of the fracture is equalized, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another bandage over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards evenly place over these bandages properly made splints immediately, if there is no swelling in the place, nor a warm abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is swelling or an abscess in it, then put on it what sits on that abscess and removes the swelling; and leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten the splints over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the splints be made from halves of wide, smooth, skillfully shaped cane; or let them be made from the wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine or gerard, that is, palm branches, or calamus; and let the size of each splint be according to this form, and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the splint which is placed over the wound itself be somewhat thicker and wider than the other splints; and the length of the splint should be according to what is allowed by the limb in size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind over the splints with another bandage, according to the same first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind over it neatly with threads, according to what we said about the binding: and it is so that your binding over the place of the fracture is tighter; and the farther it extends from the fracture, the looser the binding.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and fineness, and be of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the practice of foolish men placing their threads from twisted linen cords, it is a great error; because the binding falls with them outside the proper quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads again are not suitable; because you will not achieve with them through the binding that which you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger between splint and splint.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	But if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after binding in healthy places, then place under them some soft tow, or carded wool, until nothing is injured by it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and a break occurs in the skin, I will deal with its treatment in the appropriate chapter.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken limb needs to be bound with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is because, when a limb is large, it is not necessary to place splints on it except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your assurance from the outcome of a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters which the ancients used, which are placed over fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The method of a shortened common plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children: because it is made of things which neither heat nor cold overcomes.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, and it is the marrow of the flour which hangs on the walls of the mill at the movement of the millstone: and prepare it as it is, except that you sift it with egg white: and make its consistency neither thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The method of another plaster, restoring fracture, and dislocation, and torsion.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almess, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugath: and the juice of all, of each ten drachms; of myrrh, and aloes, of each five drachms; and of alethil, twenty drachms. Let all be ground, and sifted, and mixed with the water of alethil: or with egg white, if the complexion of the patient is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	The method of another plaster, which also benefits fracture and torsion.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugath, and mess, and white mallow, of each ten drachms; of myrrh, and aloes, of each five drachms; of acacia, six drachms; of Armenian bole, twenty drachms. Let all be ground very finely, and sifted, and made up with water, or egg white: and let it be applied.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The method of a plaster for joints, and bones separated from their places: and it soothes the pain occurring to them, and the fissure of a bone, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Let greasy wool be taken, and submerged in vinegar, and boiled oil: and let it be placed upon the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And indeed in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good in soothing a hot abscess: and it expels pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The method of a plaster which restores a fractured bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of the wild fig, and leaves of wild poppy: and grind everything, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The method of a shortened plaster, administered in the restoration of a bone fracture: and when you wish the resolution of the remainder of an abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take of the root of marshmallow, and of chamomile, and of violet flowers, and of herb flour, of each one part: let all be ground, and made up with wine, if the member is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	But if it is heated, then make it up with the water of moist coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	The method of another stronger plaster in resolution, than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take of marshmallow root, and of linseed, and of balaustium, and of melilot, and of bugloss, and of violet flower, and of chamomile, of each one part; let all be ground, and made up with willow water, or with fresh water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	The whole according to the warmth of the member, and the quiet of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything should be put on a broken member during its restoration except cerate made from wax and oil: nothing else; and he related that it should be of medium thickness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	To Galen, however, it seemed good that things possessing drying warmth should be put on a broken member during its restoration, such as myrrh and aloes and frankincense, and things similar to them from among those which we have related.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of a plaster which contributes to injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugath, and chickpeas, and cut human hair, or bird's feather, and mallow, and salt in equal parts; let them be ground and sifted and made up; and let a plaster be made from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The amount of time for which the bandage ought to remain, then be loosened, is that you should consider then if no pain or itching happens to the patient, nor is the broken bone moved from its place: then do not loosen it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if intense itching or disturbing pain or swelling happens to him in the place, then hasten and loosen it at once, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth or a soft sea sponge, moistened: and dip it in warm water, and wash the place with it until the itching rests and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place on it cut wool, dipped in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it on for one night, until you are secure from a hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb rests, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then return it to a thin bandage and a small plaster: and do not bind it with your first constriction, and thin it with it until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	But if you see that the abscess, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all the symptoms are now completely removed, and you need a plaster and bandage, then repeat it as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	But if nothing of what we have said happens to the limb, then do not unbind it except after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is left for twenty days, all of it, according to what appears to you from the loosening of the limb, as we said, until when the fracture adheres, and the coagulation of flesh approaches it: then add also to the bandage more than your whole first bandage: and add also to the thickening of the patient's food, according to what his previous recollection was.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture drying out and becoming thinner than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore bathe it with warm water at every time when you unbind it, and let this be for three days, and ease the bandage a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this operation, therefore, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But what foolish restorers of a fractured limb do in another way, when it is not restored in the first place as it ought, and is restored according to crookedness, is an error in their operation, and a great risk; and if it were right, the ancients would have said it in their books, and would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have seen no trace of them anywhere at all, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Concerning the treatment of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The kinds of fracture are diverse, and its forms are many, and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture which is made by a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the bone entirely until it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood: and on account of this this kind of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a sword cuts some of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to its end: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Elevation absolutely.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture which is a breaking, or wearing away: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall upon a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the membrane which is under the bone: or it is in the surface of the bone: and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone in the fineness of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and on account of this this kind of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And among them is a fracture which is made by a fall, or blow of a stone, and similar things, which cause a plate of bone to enter inwards, and a concavity is made in the place: just as happens to copper cauldrons, when a blow meets them, and part of them enters inwards.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this happens most often in the heads of moist bones, such as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And for all these kinds of fractures separate treatments are made, and I will come with a recollection of the whole of that in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these kinds of fracture by examination over it, and investigation of them with probes, and removal of the corrupt flesh which is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The capillary kind however is recognized by this, that it is uncovered over the bone, and wiped, and anointed over it with encaustic: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment however of a fracture, consider first the accidents of the patient: then if you see from the accidents that it signifies by manifest signification danger, such as vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of understanding, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar to them among accidents in many conditions, undoubtedly it is not healed: and if you see accidents not frightening you, and you hope for salvation: then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if a wounded man comes to you first when he is wounded: and that is in the winter days, then it is necessary that you strive in the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the membrane is corrupted, and those accidents which we have related happen.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	But if the fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with small pieces, and attraction: then it is necessary that you cut the broken and worn part, according to what I relate to you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is to shave the head of the wounded man: and uncover the bone in whichever way is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light upon the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If a flow of blood or a hot abscess happens to you upon the uncovering of the bone: then oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is to fill the place with cloths infused in wine and rose oil: and to make the wound rest, until the abscess settles, and you are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method indeed is, to cut the bone with a sharp-pointed incisor: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then use another incisor after the first, somewhat wider: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then use yet another incisor, wider even than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is, that you have a number of different incisors: some of which are wider than others, and some shorter than others: and let them be sharp at their ends, and let them be made of good iron or steel: and use gentle force in striking the incisor, so that it does not shake the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is strong, hard: then it is necessary that you perforate its circumference, before you use the incisors, with drills which are called non-penetrating drills: and they are not so called, except because they do not pass through the limit of the fleshy bone to that which is behind it: because the drill has a round end above that which is beneath its sharp head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents it from sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take of these drills a large number, each of which is suited to the quantity of the thickness of the bone, until you have for every skull a drill: the quantity of whose sharp end in length and shortness is according to the quantity of the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of drills, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	But the quality of perforating the circumference of the fractured bone is: that you place the drill upon the bone, and revolve it with your fingers, until you know that the bone is now penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another place, and place what is between each hole a quantity of the thickness of a finger, or about that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then incise with incisors what is between each hole of bone: and make it as thin as you can from the end of lightness, as we said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with something else from among certain instruments which you have prepared for it: such as forceps, and fine pliers.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you take every precaution lest the drill or incisor touch anything of the dura mater.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	Therefore, when you have gone around the bone by perforating, and it has been separated from the dura mater, if it was continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you shave and smooth the extremity of that which remains in the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thinner and finer than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	But if something remains of small bones and spicules, then take them away easily with what you have of instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound afterwards with pledgets and ointments which we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, altogether far from fear: which Galen mentioned, and praised it with great praise: and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin uncovering the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more severe and more obvious until, when you have uncovered that part, you place under it the end of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part, being smooth, does not cut anything; and its sharp part, going along its two sides in length, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests on the peritoneum, its sharp side falling on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike the incisor from one side with a small hammer until you cut through the whole bone easily, as if it were being rolled; and you will be safe from the membrane, so that nothing will happen to it which you fear at all.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not the most foolish of men, and more ignorant of it, nor were sleeping, then if anything of the membrane remained attached to the bone in some places, he would cut it away from it with the end of its lenticular incisor, and free it from it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the membrane, and that which is cut away from the bone is its surface, and roughness and fine splinters remain in it: then it is necessary that you shave that roughness, and remove those splinters with fine rasps from among which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that it is possible for you to use those which are most suitable and most appropriate in each place, according to that to which the operation leads you, and the fractured bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you proceed in your work, by first rasping the bone, with the wider of those rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use a finer one after it.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing that continuously, until you come to using the finest and most delicate of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small, hair-like fissures and fine fractures, it is necessary that you apply treatment according to that which leads to its straightening.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter which is not hidden from anyone who has any study in this art, and has considered what we have written and shown concerning large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the exposed membrane remains when you remove the bone, then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can so that the omentum is not burdened.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a broad bandage over it; and do not bind it tightly, except to the extent that it only holds the wound; and leave it with this dressing for one day or two days, until you are sure of being free from a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then unbind it, and afterwards apply medicines which counteract excessive dryness, such as lily roots, herb flour, frankincense powder, birthwort, and similar things; and you should make a powder from these medicines which is sprinkled on the wound when dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply to it any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And be careful, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment is clean; and that there is neither dirt from the ointment, nor filth in it.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not allow pus to collect in it at all; because when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and great harm happens to the patient afterwards; and it already happens in the siphac of the head, when the bone is cleaned of it, especially when its treatment is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider then, if the accidents which we have mentioned happen to the patient, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not happen except from the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine to make that blackness: then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and apply a cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the siphac; afterwards treat it with the kinds of treatment which are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that only two of its upper parts are broken together, or one of them; because these are two bones: since its lower part is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and nothing happens to it except abrasion, and crookedness, and flatness.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of it is broken, then it is necessary that you insert your little finger into the hole of the nose, and set that fracture with your index finger and thumb from outside, until the nose returns to its natural form: and let this be done skillfully, with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware lest pain befall the sick person through your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it is necessary that it be set with the end of a radius, in which there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If however the fracture is in two parts, then do likewise: and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the calming of the warm abscess.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a linen pledget, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two pledgets if the fracture is in two parts; and let the thickness of the pledget be of such a quantity that it fills the opening of the nose.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that the pledgets should be soaked in butter, and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That however does not seem to me good; indeed it is necessary that the pledget be soaked in egg white, mixed with mill dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the pledget until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of a pledget, after a soft cloth is wrapped around it; and it happens that this holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that; and if you wish, make pledgets.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	But if a hot abscess should again occur in the nose while you are operating, plaster the nose with cerate, or with cotton soaked in rose oil, or a little diachylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that you plaster it with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place soft lint over it, and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the nasal bones are fractured with a small fracture, or are comminuted, then it is necessary that you incise over them and extract them with instruments which are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew the incision, and treat it with that which produces granulation and consolidation from suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	But if a wound occurs between the nostrils, then it is necessary that you treat it with linen strips; and administer a lead cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then observe if its fracture is only external, and it is not broken in two, and is bent inwards; then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if its fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; similarly if the fracture is in the left mandible, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with it the hump of the fracture inwards with ease to the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone gently, and with it equalize it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	But if the fracture of the mandible is already separated into two, then it is necessary to apply extension from both parts, according to straightness, until its equalization is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however shaking or disruption has already occurred in the teeth, then bind those which you hope will remain with a gold or silver wire, or bristle.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a cerate over the fractured mandible.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a doubled cloth over it, and place over the cloth a large, properly made splint; or a piece of sole leather equal in length to the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above, according to how its bandage is prepared and its application is suitable, until it is not destroyed; and instruct the patient to use tranquility and quiet; and give him as food soft drinks.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you estimate that something of the form is already altered in some way, then hasten and unbind it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then rectify what is altered from it, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the cerate; and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	Therefore, while that plaster remains attached to it, and the arrangement of the bone is not altered, leave it, lest you unbind it, until it heals; or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For often this fracture is bound in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	But if meanwhile a hot abscess should occur, then administer what we have often said in its sedation, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if a piece is now separated from the bone, or from the splinter: then be skillful in this, so that you remove those splinters of the splinter with what suits you in their removal from among the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the opening of the wound is narrow, then enlarge it with a fleam according to the amount of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those splinters, and nothing of them remains, sew then the opening of the wound, if it is wide; and if not, place upon it of the plasters which are suitable for it, and they will cause it to grow flesh, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the clavicle, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The clavicle is indeed very often broken on the anterior side from the side of the shoulder, and its fracture happens according to one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For it is either broken and separated into two, except that splinters occur in it: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or so that splinters occur in the bone: and it is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or so that it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it when the fracture is without a wound, is that you cause two assistants to be present, so that one of them holds the aid which follows the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers, until its form is made, according to what is necessary: and let there be neither prominence nor concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	But if you need more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's neck a sphere of cloth or wool: and let its size be according to the quantity of your need: and extend and elevate the clavicle, and compress the sphere with your hand, until you equalize the fracture, according to what is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	But if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has reached the depth, then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back upon his neck: and you place under his shoulder a cushion moderate in size, and let the assistant press his shoulder downwards, until the bone of the clavicle which is deep is raised upwards: and then rectify the fracture, and equalize it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If however you feel a splinter from the clavicle, and it moves, then it is necessary that you incise over it, and extract the splinter easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	But if it is retained in the bone, then make an incision into it with one of the scalpels which you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the clavicle the instrument which preserves the *sifach*: and this instrument is of wood or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is similar to a spoon which does not have a concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you need of it from the size of the bone, and the smallness of it.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length however, also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two ends, as you see: and let one end be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	But if the disruption of the wound which you cut when you extracted the splinter of bone, is wide, and you are secure from a hot abscess: then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's fissure.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	But if a hot abscess should occur, then dip a cloth in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and place it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A constriction however of the bone when it is without a wound, and without a cut, is that you place on the bone a plaster made from mill flour with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft pledget on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its tickling, if you need that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a himematem, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long: and let its width be one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled pad over the pledget and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a small tablet of thin wood, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the tablet in the place of the alhimemati which falls upon the fracture and the place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alhimemati over the fracture as it is rolled up, and wrap it around its neck, and under its healthy little finger, and under its injured little finger: and bring it over every part, and as you see that the bandage holds the fracture with a decent bandage: and it is that, which is not hidden from you, and all, so that the tablet is not removed from above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason it is necessary that you look at the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever therefore the bandage softens, and you see the tablet is already being removed: then straighten it, and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his little finger at his sleep at night, so that with it his support may be raised from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, the fracture of the clavicle is raised by the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage, unless an accident occurs at the site from itching, or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see its surface adhering to it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the constriction, and leave it until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed, the fracture of the clavicle is constricted and strengthened to a great extent in twenty-eight days; and sometimes it happens in some men in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the scapula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The scapula is rarely fractured, and in its broad part; and only its margins are fractured from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore a place is fractured from it, and it is fractured in its middle, and this is not known except by touch: then, according to what the figure of the fracture is, attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural form in every way ingenuity allows you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place over the place mill dust with egg white, and soft lint, and place over this a small pillow of doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place over it a broad splint of thin wood according to the size of the whole scapula, or a little larger than it.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	But if there is a concavity under the splint in any place of the scapula, then equalize that concavity with soft lint until the splint descends evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind it over with a long bandage, with decent constriction, and firmness of the splint, until it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And examine the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever, therefore, the bandage loosens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it is moved from its place: and let the patient lie on his sound side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And indeed the scapula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore that number is completed, then unbind the bandage: and you shall be secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose consolidation is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if a fragment of bone protrudes and punctures beneath the skin: then incise over it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the fracture of the clavicle from the settling of a hot abscess, if anything should arise from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone is sometimes fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities, however, are very often fractured and crushed by accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle, which inclines downwards, is fractured, and intense pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing occur: and perhaps he vomits blood, and a hollow in the fractured bone is apparent and not hidden from the sense, its restoration is that the patient be laid on his back; and place a cushion between his shoulder blades.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and bring together the ribs from both sides or flanks with the hands: and carefully adjust it, in every way that is possible and appropriate, until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and lint over it, and place on top a splint of thin willow or linden wood, or similar light woods, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then carefully bind it over the fractured bone, so that it is not moved: and go with the binding around the back several times, and tighten it with a suitable binding.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then examine the binding every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if necessity demands its loosening because of itching, or ulceration which occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hasten, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has occurred with the appropriate method of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then replace the plaster, if you see that it is suitable: and apply a bandage to it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	Concerning the restoration of ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the thick parts which follow the back, and from their extremities on the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And attrition does not happen to them except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense upon investigation with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that you equalize the fracture with the fingers according to the possible way, until the figure is equalized, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters, and bind the broken bone with a splint, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined inwards: then intense pain and a stabbing pain happens to the patient, like the stabbing pain that happens to one who has pleurisy; because the bone pierces the membrane, and also difficulty of breathing, coughing and vomiting much blood happens to him: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients have been ingenious in it with many devices: and among them are those who say that you should give the patient foods that generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflamed and distended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We, however, refuse, so that a quick cause for making a hot abscess is not made, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a cupping glass be placed on the place, then let it be sucked with force, and it is more similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Nevertheless, it is feared that the cupping glass will draw superfluities to the place, because of the disposition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil: and let powders be placed between the ribs, until it is filled: so that the ligature is equal when you wrap it according to the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then let the sick person be treated with the treatment for pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	But if a severe thing constricts the sick person, which he does not tolerate, and the bone pierces the covering with a wounding puncture, and we fear for the sick person: then it is necessary that we cut over the place, and uncover the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us place over it the instrument which preserves the sifac, the mention of which preceded: and let us incise the bone with ease, and let us incise it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture: and let us treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	But if a warm abscess should happen in the meantime, then hasten, and infuse lint in rose oil, and place it over the place: and let the sick person be treated with what is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile also, let him be laid on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, a fracture sometimes happens to the bones of the neck, and attrition rarely happens to them; and similarly also to the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor clench them; and when you clench them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in most instances it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them, and feels constriction with the fingers and the prick: then know that the bone of the neck is safe, and that the infirm person will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if something similar to that happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not: then consider his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and that which happened in the hands happens in them: then when he lies on his back, flatulence and excretion comes out involuntarily; and when he lies on his stomach, excretion comes out involuntarily; and when he lies on his back, and wants to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore do not labor in his cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If, however, nothing of that happens to him, the matter is less serious.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment of that which happens from it is that you strive for the sedation of the warm abscess: so that you place on the rubbed vertebra rose oil alone; or with the yolks of roasted eggs.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place that on it several times a day, until the warm abscess is sedated: then place on the spot one of the strengthening, drying plasters, and bind it on tightly with a bandage: and instruct the patient to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Nor should he sleep on the side where he finds pain, until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	But if it happens at the rubbing of a bone that is decayed, or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary that you incise above the skin, and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some incarnative ointment, until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	But if the last bone of the alhausos is broken, and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary that you insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and set the broken bone with the other hand, as much as possible, and with a second setting.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place it on top of it, and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment which preceded, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Concerning the restoration of the hip.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely are the bones of the hips broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	But if they are broken, then their fracture is nothing but a shattering at their extremities: and they are split lengthwise, and incline inwards: and the patient experiences pain in the place, and a pricking: and the leg which is broken becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is indeed such that you extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture in the way that is its form.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	But if the fracture is only at its extremities, then set that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from a setting, until it is assimilated to its natural form.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is lengthwise, or now inclines inwards: then make the patient lie on his belly, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have set it, place a plaster over it: then place over it a splint of wood, or of leather: and bind it tightly over which you do not fear a displacement of the fracture, nor a removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of those with that which fills it, until the binding takes it according to equality: and instruct the patient to sleep on his back, or on his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if a hot abscess happens to him, then cease from its extension and its restoration, until the hot abscess settles: and place over it that which settles it, as preceded, then return to its restoration: and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if it happens in a splintered bone, or is crushed, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the Ulna.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The ulna is that which is between the elbow and the head of the scapula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	Therefore, if it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligatures will be tied at the two extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then let it be hung from a high place: and let the patient sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then let him throw his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches his armpit, in the middle of which the curve of the wood is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above it, so that the attendant may extend it downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then let the physician equalize the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it ought.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is, that the patient lies on his back: and let his hand be hung from his neck with a ligature.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two attendants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with his hands; and that the other hold that which is below it, and each extend to his part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with one ligature, and above it with another; and let each of the two attendants extend to his own side.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary that one ligature be placed under the armpit, and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a ligature be placed above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then set the fracture easily without effort, until when the fracture is set as it should be, and a good application is applied: then bind it, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave off the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place upon it shredded wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess is quiet: then bind it: and the manner of binding it is to place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then let him place the arm on a support, and place his open hand upon his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth and bind the arm to the support so that the arm remains in the position of the stars: if nothing prevents you from doing so, nor is anything altered in you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	But if you fear that something will be altered in you from the broken bone, then use splints: and it is that you place over the fracture itself a splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between each splint the width of a finger; and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the splints the binding which I described at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your binding over the place of the fracture be tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is elongated, the less tight should be the binding.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the placement of the splints and the binding, as we have said, at the hour in which you restore the limb immediately, then do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave off the binding and splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then observe the bandage for three days, lest itching or swelling occur at the site, or food be prevented from reaching the limb, because of the overly tight bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore rectify all that, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not untie the bandage until after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient sleep on his back, and his hands on his stomach; and place under the injured area a cushion filled with wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And observe every hour of the night or day, lest the fractured shape of the limb be loosened, or the bandage softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore rectify all that with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give the patient food according to the order which we have prescribed, so that the food is at first light, until the bone begins to knit; then it is necessary that you increase his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is the custom of a broken arm and leg that it is bound for forty days: then therefore it is necessary that it be unbound, and a bath be administered, and it be treated with ointments which heal it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	But if the fracture is foul, and comminuted, then do not unbind it and the splints until fifty days, and even up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearms.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small; and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore only the larger forearm is broken, or the smaller; and perhaps they are broken together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the small upper forearm is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower forearm is broken, its fracture is bad, and its healing difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones are broken together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone which is broken is the small upper forearm, then it is suitable for the physician, in its restoration, that he put a small extension easily, until he sets it.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if it is the large forearm which is broken: then it is necessary that he put a very strong constriction.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he put the shape of the hand in its restoration, and its extension extended on a cushion.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers: and let the lowest joint be lower than all the fingers, or the rest: and let the patient sit squarely on himself, and let the cushion be in front of him, or directly in front of him at a height so that the patient does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the attendant extend the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And let another attendant extend from above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then let the physician set the bone until he reduces it according to the best shape that he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	But if in a fracture of the bone there are splinters, then strive to reduce each fragment to its place by your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If however a separated splinter appears in it, and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope in its restoration: then incise over it, and remove it according to the method which we have described in what has gone before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already devoted a separate chapter to that, therefore take its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	But if a warm abscess occurs at the beginning of your reduction, then smear a cloth with cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with a thin bandage, until the abscess subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from the powder of the mill with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then apply splints, and let the splint which is placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most situations, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then apply your bandage over the place of fracture more tightly and strongly, and somewhat more with the bandage to the upper parts of the fracture, or to the lower parts of it: or apply a bandage somewhat softer than that, according to what was previously recalled at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths which are wrapped over the fracture be soft, moist cloths: and let them not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is bound be of linen, properly medium between fine and coarse, as we have related.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And examine the limb and the bandage after some days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	But if something happens which requires correction, such as itching which happens to the limb: then it is necessary that you bathe the limb with warm water until that itching ceases, and leave the limb unbound until it rests, then repeat the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	But if the bandage is now softened, and the bone is now removed, and similar things to these: then correct all of that with your skill, and examine again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb because of the excessive tightness of the bandage, then it is necessary that you soften it a little, and leave it for several days until nourishment flows to it, then bind it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if nothing of what we have said happens to the patient, then it is not necessary that it be loosened, except after twenty days, or about that many.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the patient's hand be hung around his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be straight, and be kept by its own strength from agitated movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All that is according to the dispositions of complexions, and dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that a fracture rarely happens to the back of the hand and the knuckles of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to it, except by much rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture or rubbing happens to the palm, then it is necessary that the sick person sit squarely; and in front of him let there be a seat of equal height.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the assistant extend the broken bones, and let the physician set them, until when they are joined with a good joining.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he put a plaster and lint, if a hot abscess does not happen.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint on top according to the size of the place: and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is towards the lower parts around the sole of the foot, then make something like a sphere from cloth: and instruct the patient to tighten it over it with his broken sole: then let it be bound with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the splint be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather may be applied with the body of the sole: and bind it, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary: that you put one splint on top, and another splint underneath on the sole: and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then apply a bandage, as the hand is rolled: and extend between the fingers with a ligature.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	But if a fracture happens to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it is to be set according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then let it be bound with the sole: and if you wish, put a small, straight splint on it: so that the fracture may be raised, and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, or little, and ring fingers, then it is to be set, and bound with the healthy finger which follows it: or let all be bound together in a continuous manner: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small splint on it, as we said in the case of the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the disposition of a warm abscess: and oppose it with what is necessary, when something happens from it, according to what is repeated in its account.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often fractured, and this is evident to the senses: because it is turned towards the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in such a way that a ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient is laid prostrate on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then let the attendant extend each ligament to its part equally; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is close to the root of the hip, then let the ligament be placed at the part of the pecten, so that the extension falls upwards; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then let the physician equalize the bone with both his hands, until he restores it to the likeness of its natural form: and let the bone be joined with a good joining.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and a bandage, if an abscess does not occur in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if an abscess occurs in it, then leave it for some days, until the hot abscess subsides, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	Moreover, its bandage should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap a hard linen cloth, that is, a bandage, over the fracture; and double it twice, or three times; and let a surplus remain from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the leg and hip what remains from the linen cloth.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place splints on the hip at the place of the fracture, and place one of them over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the constriction is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture with three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you extend the bandage from the place of the fracture, let your constriction be less, softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then attend to the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore, tie with both three small splints which are on top.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with the two ends of the thread downwards until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both, also tighten the ends of the splints from the other side, so that the bandage is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then loosen the binding over it while it remains, so that neither corrosion nor abscess nor swelling, and things similar to them, happen to the limb.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything of that should happen.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore hasten with its loosening, and correct whatever happened from it entirely, according to what we have often said.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if there is a piece of bone in the bone which punctures: then it is necessary that you smooth it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, saw over it and remove it: and treat it with that whose remembrance preceded, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is constricted, besides which splints are added to it, as we said in the case of the arm and the forearm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of it thus fractured, lameness does not happen to the patient.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, except that another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he whose it is, limps always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is constricted in fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is subtracted: all that is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Concerning the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fracture of the kneecap rarely happens, but attrition happens to it very often.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If, however, a fracture happens to it, then it is only either a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And the whole thing is dealt with according to sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is thus, that what is disrupted of its parts is made even with the fingers, until it is brought together and joined as much as possible by evenness and ease, and making.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white: and place a round bandage over it, if you need it: and bind over it with a bandage suitable for it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions which we have recounted in the other fractures: such as a hot abscess, and things similar to it: so that you oppose every accident with that which suits it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the leg has two bones, of which one is thick, and is called by the name of the leg: and the other is thin, and is called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And to both of these kinds of fracture happens what happens to the two bones of the arm: and on account of that its restoration is done, just like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are broken, the leg is twisted in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is twisted towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it lower down: and it is one of those which are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and setting, and bandaging of the splints according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the leg fracture is a bad fracture, having many splinters, the extension should be less, and your alleviation gentler.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something in the operation above the arm: and it is that when you set the splints, and have completed all your operation, then take two splints of pine wood, which is used in the making of sunshades which are placed under the boards: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from them those which are of small thickness, and not from the small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each one a cloth with two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee to the lower part of the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two splints in three places, at the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when constriction is prevented, the leg inclines neither to the right nor to the left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed let a cradle be made of wood according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it may be kept from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is especially necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is a proper wound with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then examine the leg every day, and treat it diligently against an abscess, or swelling, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If then anything of these things happens, then treat it with what is appropriate, until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Concerning the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, a complete fracture does not happen to the heel bone.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, fracture sometimes happens to the bones of the foot, and also rarely to the toes: and to them there happens nothing but attrition in most instances.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture happens to the bones of the foot, and you see those bones raised up on top of one another, then let the patient place his foot on the ground prepared, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand, and place your foot on that which is raised up from those bones; afterwards press, or tread on it: and level it, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster, and lint on top: and place under the sole of the foot a small board, which has two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths, and other things which it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed, then untie the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones set, whether they are fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore the operation in them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if some fingers are broken, then restore them and set them as I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a small splint along the length of the finger, and let it be a little wider than it; then place this splint under the foot, as I have told you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place on each finger a splint of its size, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the splint to the lower part of the foot; and let it stand on one end of the splint outside the belly of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you, that you not forget, but consider all that I have told you in the other fractures from the accidents which we have mentioned: and apply to each accident what is appropriate.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of a woman's vulva, and of the pubic bone, and of a man's penis.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her slightly toward her back, and let her be held back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton, until she fills it: and let it be made into a sphere in the vulva from it.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	Then that cotton comes out, until it becomes like a sphere before the opening of the vulva, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a cushion on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When therefore she wants to urinate, let her remove the cotton easily, then let her urinate: and replace it in the same way as you introduced it at first: then let her return to her first cushion.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a reed tube over its opening, and introduce the whole bladder into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube forcefully, until the bladder is inflated inside the vulva, for the fracture will be reduced.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with cotton, and let her remain for some days, as we have described, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the pubic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and setting what we have described for the hip bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the proper method is not hidden in these nearby fractures which occur frequently, especially for one who has some study or experience.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this book of mine well, because the fracture itself shows you in many situations the proper way for its restoration and setting: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the penis is broken, take a goose's neck and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over it a bandage of cloth, and let it be bandaged, and leave it for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the bones when it is with a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is suitable for one to whom a fracture with a wound has happened, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or of the thigh bone, or similar to it, that you hasten and immediately bleed him: if the conditions for bloodletting attest to you, as we have premised.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	But if the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary that you hasten to its excision, so that you may sprinkle upon it crushed alum: if nothing else is present to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it, if an abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a hot abscess occurs, then delay its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess settles.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth day absolutely, for you would cause bad things to happen to it.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, uncovered: then it is necessary that you try to reduce it, and to equalize it with your hands with ease and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	But if the extension of it, and its equalization with your hands, is not prepared: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument which is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven or eight fingers: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And on account of that it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them according to the quantity which he needs for it from the treatment in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be in it a small thickness, so that it is not doubled by compression on it at the time of the operation: and let it be of a sharp extremity, which has a margin at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be of a thickness from its middle to its lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that its sharp curved end be placed upon the end of the prominent bone; and push it with it at once, until when the bone returns and is made even by a certain evenness.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore strive to even the ends of the fracture to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	But if the ends of it which are broken are small, and the instrument does not grasp it well, then it is necessary that you cut the end of that bone until the instrument can get hold of it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	But if you cannot reduce them completely with what we have described, then incise it with whatever is suitable from among the incisors which we have mentioned; or saw it with a saw in whatever way is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then shave away what remains on the bone of roughness and small pieces of bark.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	Therefore when the bone is reduced, and the patient finds afterwards, after its reduction, vehement pain that harms him, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Therefore do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you give the patient great help when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then submerge the cloth in astringent, black wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place cerate on the wound, nor anything in which there is oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then apply splints at the completion of your bone restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound uncovered, so that you cut a hole in the bandages with scissors according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take every precaution lest you constrict the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For often foolish physicians have done this, and have caused death, or corrosion, or zuchem, that is, pus, to befall their patients.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your binding be soft, gentle, different from the binding of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	But if the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some bad occurrences about it which we have narrated, and you find pain suspended in the place: then it is not necessary that you place splints upon it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them wrappings of hard cloths in place of splints, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound now beginning to generate pus in it: then remove from above it the cloth which you placed upon it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer lint and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar things.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every day morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus flows from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	But if many days pass for the wound and it does not heal, nor is pus discharged from it: then know that there are small splinters of bone there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary that you explore the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	However many of those splinters are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of them which are not separated, and pierce the limb, and cause pain to occur, try to cut them and remove them in every way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	But if a swelling or ekileten, that is, an esthiomenus, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction happens to the wound: then it is necessary that you apply to each of them that which is suitable to it from the treatment, of which the narration preceded in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And of that in which my speech ought to stand, and to which you should give your present attention when a bone is broken and protrudes upon a limb, such as the hip bone and the collarbone, and similar large bones, it is that you should not attempt its extraction, for very often death results from this; rather leave it until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore treat the wound, if it seems good to you; and if not, leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Concerning the treatment of a node in the track of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This node often occurs in the track of the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially that which is near the joints; and its form disfigures the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider then, if the node is recent: administer to it medicines which have astringent properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you may take some of these, or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and apply them to the node on lint, and bind them tightly upon it with a good bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the bandage, and do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another, until the node is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind a thin plate of lead neatly over it.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the node has already been converted into stone, and is tight, and urgent necessity prompts its removal: then incise it from its upper part, and cut away the prominent excess; or shave it with some razors, until it is removed: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and the member remains afterwards thin, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored, and the limb afterwards remains thin, weak: then this does not happen except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is, the multitude of the loosening of the ligament and its binding not as it ought; or because of the excess of tightening of the ligaments, until nourishment is prevented from flowing to the member; or because of the multitude of superfluous embrocation at an inappropriate time; or because of the small amount of blood in the body of the sick person, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its treatment is, to nourish the sick person, and to make his body strong, until the blood is multiplied in him.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch on the member: so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And diligently embrocate it with warm water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are set crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When crookedness and a prominence of the broken bone, or a knot, occurs in a member already set after its healing, and the form of the member is marred thereby, yet the member is not prevented from its natural function: then it is not necessary that you accept the opinion of him who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed highly blameworthy, leading to death, or great fear, so that it is certainly mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knotting are recent: then it is necessary that it be bathed with warm water, in which emollient herbs have been boiled, such as mallow leaves and its root, and melilot, and things like them.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made with a softening plaster, such as properly made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let the mucilage of mallow root be taken, and shaken with hen's fat, or sesame oil: and let it be plastered with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let fat figs be taken, and ground with pigeon dung, and similar things which are named among medicines that diminish consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knotting is resolved with frequent, gentle, and prolonged rubbing, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let movement of the limb be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if tortuosity has preceded, and has become strong, and has been converted into stone, and the necessity has been provoked to cure it with iron: then it is necessary that its upper part be cut, and the continuity of the bone be loosed, and that which superabounds from the knotting or bone be incised with fine scalpels: and let ease be administered in it with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Concerning the discourse on dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of any of the joints from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prohibited from its motion, and the shape of the limb is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes intense pains and injuries to befall the afflicted.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration; and one should not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, on account of that, it is not fitting that it be moved, nor extended at the time of its inflammation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it very often causes spasms and injuring pains.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then it is necessary that you hasten to the bloodletting of the patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left alone until the abscess is quiet.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then let the limb be rubbed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then let it be reduced easily.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And let every limb be treated with that whose recollection will come in its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocation, also according to what preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are seldom dislocated except rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both happens according to one of two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For either they are removed from their places by a small removal, and are somewhat softened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation, until they are softened to the breast, until the saliva of the sick person flows, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is involved with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	But when its dislocation is small, then it returns in most instances by itself with little [effort].
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if the dislocation is complete, then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not be delayed at all: and it is so that the attendant holds the head of the sick person; and the physician inserts the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the jaw of the dislocation between its bone, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts his two thumbs together, if the dislocation is on two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hands are outside, with which he levels [the jaw].
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the patient to clean his jaws, and free them for eating on every side.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician levels the jaw, and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are together: then administer a vaporization with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: nor delay the reduction of both completely, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	Therefore, when they return and are leveled, and the mouth of the sick person is closed, and they are not softened: then place over them small cushions of cloth, with cerate which is made from wax and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it should be bound easily with soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the sleep of the sick person be on his back: and his head should be positioned between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left: nor should he try, or be forced to chew anything; rather, let his food be a gentle sipping, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is bound: then let him eat what he wants, and let it be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let him not exert himself in the operation of his mouth in eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is bound, and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	But if the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at some time, and are not returned to their places: then fevers frequently result from this, and constant thirst: and perhaps the belly of the sick person is loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore when you see that, then know that it is a loss, and very often he to whom this happens dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle, and the extremity of the shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	Indeed, the clavicle is not dislocated from the inner side, because of its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated outwards: and that is apparent to the sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back, and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then compress the place with your palm with a strong compression, for it will return itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaster and compresses on it, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	However, its extremities which follow the elbow, and are continuous with it, are not dislocated except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	But if it is dislocated on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and set right according to what we have said, and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaster, compresses, and a bandage on it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Concerning the reduction of a dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is that it is dislocated towards the armpit, downwards.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it is dislocated towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated towards the upper part of the humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated posteriorly, because of the scapula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated anteriorly, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it is most often dislocated and exits inferiorly towards the armpit: especially in those whose flesh is meager.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it exits quickly in them, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, namely because it exits with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men through a blow or a fall, and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is thought because of this that it is dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that you examine it until you are certain of it, and then you proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And a dislocation is known when it is towards the lower parts in the direction of the armpit: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a clear difference between them, and you find a concavity in the head of the humerus, and under the armpit on palpation the head of the humerus is like an egg: and the sick man cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all ways.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then you find a clear palpable difference, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed, the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is that the assistant raises his hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under his armpit, and raise the joint forcefully upwards to its place; and let the assistant raise his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him place it lower, for it returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if it does not return by what we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and a softening and soothing embrocation be administered, such as if the roots of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot are decocted in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then let the patient be laid on his back; and let a ball and wool be placed under his armpit, which is equal between softness and firmness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then let the physician place his heel on the ball, and raise the head of the humerus forcefully, and pull the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And let another assistant hold the patient's head so that it does not move downwards; for it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: it is that you cause a man to be present who is taller than the patient, and stands on the side, and inserts his shoulder under the patient's armpit; and raises his armpit upwards, until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And let another assistant pull the patient's hand towards the lower part of his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, to weigh him down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long piece of wood is fixed in the ground, the head of which is round in shape, like the handle of a mortar; which is neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let it be placed under the patient after soft cloths are placed on the head of the wood; and let the patient stand along the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then let his hand be extended downwards from the other side, and let his body be extended from the other side with force; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	But if its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is that you take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers; which has a round head, so that its entry into the depth of the rectum is eased, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied over the round head, so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then let it be placed under the patient's rectum, so that the hand or arm is extended over the wood downwards; and let the wood be tied over the support and arm and the extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then let the arm be placed on the rung of a ladder across its width, and let the hand be extended downwards, and let the rest of the body be suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	Therefore, when its entry is completed in whichever way is possible, then it is necessary that you place under the rectum a sphere of equal size made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then apply the plaster prepared from mill dust with olibanum and egg white over the whole shoulder, as it is rolled over.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind beneath the rectum with a suitable bandage; and let the bandage be rolled over the plaster from above; and let his hand be bound to his neck, and let it be left, nor let his hand be moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that the patient's food be meager until the limb is strengthened; for this is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then let more be given after seven days, or five, and let it be exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is strengthened and not softened, then it is now healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture which happens to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that a cautery with three holes be applied to it, according to what was stated previously in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	But if all this is done, and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and bandage are applied again to it several times, and it is not strengthened, and it falls down, and it cannot be raised to the upper parts: then know that its nerves which are at the head of the humerus, are now cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	The reduction, however, of a dislocation which occurs towards the chest and breast, or to the posterior parts, is done with pushing and extension with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining bandaging and care is administered to it until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	But if after healing heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then let the infirm person use a bath many times, until that heaviness is lessened, and it returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly it returns with difficulty also: and it indeed is dislocated to all parts, and especially to the anterior, or to the posterior.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it is falling under sight, and under touch, according to whichever figure it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join a dislocated elbow with a healthy one, that is clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is hollowed out, and it cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hasten, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess happens to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess happens to it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it is not healed completely, especially when it is at the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocation, and of more vehement pain than them: and very often death comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration, when it is of those which it is possible to reduce, is that his hand be extended with two hands: and his arm be extended, and the physician's hands be above the elbow and below it, and he himself push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he doubles the hand with his hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	But if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer a vehement extension, very strong: and it is that two assistants extend the arm: and two assistants also hold him, so that he is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then let the arm be rotated in every direction after a doubled long cloth, or a broad ligament, is wrapped around his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil: so that it may be of those things which help in the lubricity of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then let him impel the joint with a vehement impulse, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it, in which there is stypticity, and drying with egg white: and let it be bound with a decent bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the sick man: and leave it for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be loosed.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is fixed in its place, then untie the ligature from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not well bound, then repeat the plaster and the ligature, and leave it for several days, until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then unbind it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if heaviness occurs to it after the reduction of the joint, and the disposition is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is softened, or place upon the joint iliati, that is, the fat of a ram's rump.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then let it be bound, and leave it on it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and put it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore it sweats, then rub the joint with a moderate rubbing.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat upon it the application of the iliati once, and a second time, and a third time with the entering of the bath, until it is softened.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place upon it cow dung, moist, warmed with butter, and bind it on.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it is thus softened, and returns to its proper condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation, Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The hand is very often dislocated by Al-Mahassem, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Contrary to the other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation at the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place becomes inflamed or a hot abscess occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in it is that you place the weakened hand of Al-Mahassem on a table, and the assistant extends his hand; and the physician places his palm on the eminence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary that consideration be given whether the palm has already receded to the belly of the hand: then let the infirm person place the back of his hand on the table during extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be intrinsically on the table, that is, let the inner part of his hand be placed on the table, so that the physician's hand may fall upon the eminence of the joint itself.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster soothing the abscess, and leave it, nor repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you effect its reduction after days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its crookedness: and it harms the infirm person in no way, except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything; then know that the nerves are severed or abraded.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore there is no remedy for it except that it be cauterized near the affected area.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps that does not help at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	Therefore, when the bone does not return, then place upon it the plaster which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is to be bandaged and left for five days; afterward it is to be unbandaged and left, and the hand is to be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if its movement is impaired, and something serious happens to it, then soothe it with warm water and rub it several times until it is soothed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	Concerning the treatment of dislocations of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated in any direction, or a finger is dislocated toward the back of the palm or its belly, then extend the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and suspend it toward the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it and extend it until it is straight on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When it is night, bind it according to the same account; and do not cease to unbind it during the day; and exercise it with movement; and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days until it is tightened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do with it if it is dislocated toward the palm of the hand: and bind it to that part, and do your first operation with it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When a complete dislocation of the vertebrae of the back or neck happens to someone, or many vertebrae are removed from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death quickly approaches the patient.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of that is that the excrement of the patient comes out involuntarily, and he cannot hold it back; and oftentimes some of his limbs are weakened from it, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For oftentimes it is removed, which oftentimes makes the removal of them to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is removed to the back is called gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure of it is that you should consider then, if gibbosity occurred from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which occurs from a fall, or blow, or similar things, the ancients have already described methods of cure at great length.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which very little returns with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I, however, have now abbreviated it from that, little of which excuses much of it from my proximity to the intention: and my explanation, in which I have explained it, and formed its instrument in a way different from that in which they showed it, and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore I say that in gibbosity which occurs from the front, there is no skill, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which happens to both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, except that which happens in the back properly, with that which I relate: and it is, that the infirm person is extended upon his face upon an even podium near the wall: and a wet mat is spread beneath him, that his chest may not be injured.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight piece of wood be placed fixed in a pit in the earth, at the head of the podium: and another piece of wood around his feet at the other end of the podium: and let a servant hold the wood, and let it not be fixed in the pit.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And let another servant hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap around the head of the sick person, and under his armpits, a soft, strong ligature: and extend the end of the ligature to the wood which is at his head: and tie it to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another ligature above his hips, and above his knees, and at his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligatures, and tie them to the other wood which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let each servant extend a ligature to a part of the wood, and let the two pieces of wood not be removed from the places in which they are fixed; however, let them not be firmly fixed, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician shall place his hands upon the vertebra with strength, until it returns; or let him place a board upon it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then let him attach his feet to the board, until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And hollow out in the wall, of which we have spoken, which is near the patient, a place into which the end of the board may enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board upon the vertebra.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet upon the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him pull strongly until the vertebra is constricted, and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, work with a lathe which is revolved with your hand: and it is that you fix in the ground near the head of the patient at the end of the bed two pieces of wood, the length of one arm: and at his head at the end of the bed two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length which is between each piece of wood be one palm: and now a hole has been made in every place, in which the lathe runs: and let each piece of wood be firmly fixed in the ground, lest it be moved at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let a round piece of wood be inserted: and it is a lathe in which the rope is revolved in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole, in which is fixed a piece of wood, whose length is a palm together with that which is revolved: and in the two other pieces of wood there is similarly that.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the bandages which you have tightened on the chest of the patient with the lathe which is at his head: and the bandages which you have tightened on his legs with the lathe which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let a servant stand at each lathe, who turns his hand with the cord, with which the lathe is revolved: and let the physician adjust the vertebra, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the lathe, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the vertebra returns and the place is made level, then it is necessary that you place a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then lint.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards place on top of the plaster a small plate of wood, whose width is three fingers, or thereabouts.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length an amount which encompasses the place of the hump and extends over the healthy part of the vertebra.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then let it be bound with the bandage that we described.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the patient use a light diet until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	But if something of a prominence remains in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the application of the plate which we have described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a lead plate is applied to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes a prominence occurs in the last vertebra of the back; and a dislocation is thought to be caused by it, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore, a presumption should not be made concerning it with this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that in the hip joint and the shoulder joint, only dislocation occurs; nor does that happen to them which happens to the other joints from a small displacement and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the hip joint is dislocated in four ways.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated anteriorly and posteriorly.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it is most often dislocated inwards; and it is seldom dislocated anteriorly and posteriorly.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its inward dislocation is this: because when you join the injured leg with the healthy one, it is longer; and its knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the injured person cannot bend his foot at the groin; and the place which follows the groin is inflamed with a hot inflammation, because the head of the femur has now arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him to whom outward dislocation happens is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him to whom anterior dislocation happens is that he extends the healthy leg completely; however, he does not bend it without pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk, he cannot put weight on it anteriorly; and his urine is retained, and his groin is inflamed, and when walking, he treads on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him to whom posterior dislocation happens is that he does not extend the knee, nor can he bend it before he bends the groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction however of this kind of dislocation is that you consider then if the dislocation is old, which is already of long standing with the one having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its disposition: then there is no cure at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it is not necessary that a complete attempt be made on it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in him whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four kinds of dislocation: then hasten to this, that you move the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left: for perhaps it returns, and does not need other care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and he extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a ligature, which is tied above his leg above the knee: and another assistant extend his hand from above, so that he put his hands under his armpits.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then let him bind with a soft ligature above the hip joint, and hold the end of the other ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let its extension be either from the front of the groin to the part of the fork, or from the back to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all of them be at once, until the sick man is lifted with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common kind of the four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for every kind that which I shall say of proper treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In its proper reduction, when the dislocation is inwards, it is necessary that the sick man be laid on his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then let him place a bandage above the root of the hip, in that which is between the head of the hip and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to a higher part of the body, to the part of the clavicle.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong assistant take his arms, and reduce the swollen place of the injured hip, and extend it outwards with a strong extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now indeed it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this method is easier than the other methods of treatment by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it is excused above you, and it does not obey you to enter with this method of treatment completely: then it is necessary that the two feet of the infirm are bound together with a strong, soft bandage, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each be from its equal a quantity of four fingers: and let the infirm leg be extended more than the other by a quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the infirm person be suspended over the head of a beam which is in the house: and let its length from the ground be a quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong youth to support the head of the hip: and let another youth be suspended with the infirm: and let another youth push, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But in its own reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the infirm person lies on a bench, according to what we have narrated in the case of one having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let a bandage be tightened above his leg, the infirm one properly, and above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let an added piece of wood be placed in the middle of the bench, firmly fixed: upon which let wet cloths be wrapped, so that it does not injure the infirm: and let the wood be between his hips, so that he is not pulled downwards during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let each attendant pull on his part, and let the physician equalize the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it obeys reversion, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place it upon the board, and press it, as we said in the case of a hump, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the infirm person lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the infirm person be extended quickly: and it is according to this same account on the stand: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand upon the groin of the infirm person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he constricts it with the other hand, and with that constriction he puts it extended downwards towards the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the rear: then it is not necessary that the infirm person be extended downwards, and be raised above the ground: rather it is necessary that he be placed upon something hard, just as it is necessary that it be done if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about his lying on his two hips: and it is upon his face, and the ligaments are extended: according to what we recently said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also upon the place to which the joint goes out, when the reduction is completed as is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend the two legs of the infirm person: and when you see them equal, and the infirm person clenches his leg, and extends it without difficulty: then you know that the limb has now returned, as is necessary: then join the two hips, and apply a plaster, and bind it with a bandage, that is, a roller: so that the hip does not move to any side: and let the infirm person adhere to rest for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then untie the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation is now firm: therefore allow the infirm person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see some softening: then return, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then untie it and make him delay in walking on both for a few days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Concerning the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, that is to say, backwards.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If, however, it does not adhere to the hip, then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all the ways of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he extends his leg as much as possible upon it and you put your back to his face: and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make his knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers above his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another assistant extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres with the hip gently, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it, and make the leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then unbind them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the patient not use walking for several days, until it is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if the reduction is refused by you, then administer strong extension with bandages, the description of which preceded in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocation of the heel bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel bone is sometimes removed by a small removal, and sometimes dislocated according to the whole.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation happens either inwards or outwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment, however, of its removal is easy replacement: and it is that it is extended easily with the hands, and is made level until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment, however, when it is dislocated completely, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit upright: and a strong assistant holds him from behind at the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you hold with your right hand his foot from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the place of the heel.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left, twice.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left, and push the front of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the front of the foot to the leg a third time, and you pull the peg.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns in one or two times in this manner, and you see the foot set straight, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on it, because it returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if the reduction is prevented by what we have described, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a peg firmly in the ground, so that it falls between his hips: and you will have wrapped a cloth around it, so that it does not injure the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let an assistant take hold of his hip; afterwards let another assistant extend the foot, either with his hands or with a ligature which he ties above the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let each assistant extend against the extension of his fellow; and let the peg stand between the patient's two hips, holding him so that his body is not pulled downwards during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the physician set the dislocation with his hands, and let another assistant hold the sound leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and the soundness of its return is made clear to you, then apply a plaster and lint, and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or fear the nerves which are above the heel behind, lest the bandage be too tight upon them and injure them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	But if the bandage softens, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If however he attempts to walk before that time, it is not safe lest the dislocation be loosened again upon him, and be corrupted, and not receive a cure afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	But if a hot abscess should occur to him, then it is necessary that you administer to its subsidence that which we have narrated previously in another place concerning treatment, and embrocation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning the dislocation of the toes, and the cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated of them be set with slight extension without effort: and this indeed is not difficult, nay it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the back of the foot, then it is necessary that the infirm person make his foot sit on a place level with the ground, or on a board: and he is standing as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot on that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then tread on it with your foot with force, until it returns, and you see it now set, and no prominence appears in the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the sole of his foot a board which holds the whole foot, to which are two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then unbind it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and secured by reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Concerning the types of dislocation with a wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of that sort happens, and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often follows: and therefore one ought not to presume to undertake its cure, which is of this kind, except he who is skilled in the art through long practice, merciful, pious, cautious, not rash, nor presumptuous: and that he use in the beginning only such medicines as soothe hot abscesses: and leave the patient to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see, or hope for salvation from destruction with the mildness of the illness, and in which something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the member returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that soothes the abscess: and treat the wound with what is suitable to it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	But if the dislocation is with a fracture, and separate splinters occur in the bone, then attempt their removal, and do in that what we have said in simple illnesses from what preceded in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear: according to what my previous instruction to you was.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more saving for your body among those in your time.
