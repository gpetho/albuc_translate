 CHAPTER TWENTY.
On cauterization of teeth and of relaxed gums.
 When the gums are relaxed on account of humidity and the teeth are loose, and you treat this with drugs, and your treatment is ineffectual, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose picture will come later.
Put a cannula upon his tooth and quickly introduce the glowing cautery into it and press a little until the patient can feel the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth; then remove your hand.
Then repeat the cauterization as many times as you may desire.
Then the patient should fill his mouth with saline, hold it for a while, then spit it out.
Then the loose tooth will be made firm, the relaxed gum will be tightened, and the corrupt humidity will be dried up.
