On interlacing loose teeth with silver or gold wire.	On Stabilizing Loose Teeth with Gold Wire.	0.6972335
When the front teeth are loosened by some blow or fall and the patient cannot bite upon what he is eating lest they fall out, and you have without avail treated them with styptic medicines, the technique in this case is to bind the teeth with gold or silver wire. Gold is the better, for silver oxidizes and corrodes after some days, but gold remains for ever in its state and does not suffer this change.	When the front teeth are shaken or loosened due to an impact or fall, and the patient cannot bite down properly without risking tooth loss, and you have attempted to treat them with astringent medications without success, the best approach is to stabilize the teeth using gold wire. This is because silver turns green and corrodes over time, while gold remains unchanged.	0.8876565
The wire should be moderate in thickness in accordance with the distance between the teeth.	The wire should be of moderate thickness and fineness, appropriate to fit securely between the teeth.	0.81153184
The method is to take the wire and run it doubled between two sound teeth; then with the two ends of the wire you weave between the loose teeth, either one or several, until you bring your weaving to a sound tooth on the other side; then you repeat your weaving back to the side whence you began; tighten it gently and judiciously till they do not move at all. You should tie the wire at the root of the teeth lest it slip.	The procedure for stabilization involves taking the wire, doubling it, and threading it between two healthy teeth. Then, weave the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth—whether one or multiple—until you reach a healthy tooth on the other side. Next, weave the wire back to where you started, tightening it with precision and skill until the loose teeth are entirely stable. The constriction should be close to the roots to prevent movement.	0.89000547
Then with the scissors cut off the two ends of the wire remaining over, and bring them together and twist them with forceps and hide them between a sound tooth and a loose tooth so as to not injure the tongue; then for the future leave them thus bound.	Cut off the excess ends of the wire with scissors, twist the two ends together with forceps, and conceal them between a healthy tooth and a loose one to avoid irritating the tongue. Then leave it in place until the teeth are secure.	0.8548813
But if it comes undone or breaks, bind them with another wire; so may he have the use of them all his life.	If the wire loosens or breaks, replace it with a new one, and it will hold in place over time.	0.62368953
This is a figure of the teeth and the manner of interlacing two sound and two loose teeth, as you see.	This is the form and arrangement of the teeth in stabilizing two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as shown.	0.77323836
After one or two teeth have fallen out they may be restored to their place and bound in as instructed, and become permanent. This can be done only by an expert and gentle practitioner.	Sometimes, one or two teeth can return to their original positions after such stabilization and will stay in place, but only a skilled and experienced practitioner can accomplish this.	0.7843762
Sometimes a piece of ox-bone may be carved and made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the site where a tooth was lost, and fastened as we have said, and it will last and he will get long service from it.	In some cases, a piece of cow bone may be shaped like a tooth and placed in the gap, securing the tooth as described. This placement is stable and can last a long time.	0.79987794
