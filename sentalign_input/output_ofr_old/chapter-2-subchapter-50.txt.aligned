Just as abscesses occur in the artery and in the vein, abscesses also occur in the nerves when they are injured, or by excessive work, and similar things.	As a tumour arises on an artery or a vein, so may it also come in a tendon when it has been bruised; or it may arise from excessive fatigue, or such causes.	0.7880118
If the abscess is small, hold it with forceps and cut it at its root; and if it is large, suspend it with a hook and peel it, then remove it and close the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.	Incise the skin of those occurring on the head or forehead, and if the tumour be small take hold of it with the forceps and cut it away by the root. But if it be large, catch it up with a hook and dissect it away and remove it; and sew up the incision and dress until healed.	0.8057844
