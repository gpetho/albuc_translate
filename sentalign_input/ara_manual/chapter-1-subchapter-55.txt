Chapter Fifty-Five.
On Cauterizing Pustules that Occur on the Body.
Ugly pustules may erupt on the body from cold, thick, and corrupt humors. It is necessary, upon their first appearance, to cauterize the head of each pustule gently with a myrtle stick whose tip has been ignited with fire or with the root of long birthwort or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Warts may also be cauterized upon their first appearance in this manner, and they will not grow larger.  The excess matter causing them will dissipate, and the patient will recover. However, it is necessary that this be done after the patient has undergone bloodletting.
