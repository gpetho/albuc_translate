Leeches are not used with fire except on limbs where one cannot place cups because of their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and other similar; and the way to use them is that when you find leeches that are in clear fresh water without impurity, take them; and put them for a night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then be bled by vein or by cup, then rub the limb until it is red, and place the leeches on; and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where one can put a cup, put it there, for it is very beneficial afterwards.
If not, wash the place with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then squeeze it; and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches' bodies, wet a linen cloth in cold water, and put it on, until the blood is stanched; and if the blood is profuse, apply ground vitriol, or gallnuts, and similar things, until it is stanched; or you put on the place halves of peeled beans, and leave them until they stick to the place, it will stop immediately; and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to attach, rub the place with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until the blood comes out, and then put them on, and as soon as they smell the blood, they will attach; and when you see that they are about to fall off, sprinkle on a little aloe and crushed salt, or ash, they will fall off immediately.
