of the fistula of the eye
Physicians call a fistula "arissati":
When you treat it with cautery and with a sharp, burning medicine as I have said before, and it is not healed, the method is to cut open the abscess where it should remain, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it with the instrument, of which this is the form;
and it is called a "rough head," and it should be made of Indian steel with a round head, and pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the site of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your two fingers, and press your hand a little so that you know that the corruption is scraped;
and do this a few times, then restore the area with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the boil is healed, and remains so for 40 days, and it does not reopen and is not abscessed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed;
If not, there is no other solution than to bring the fistula back to the opening of the nerve according to this method:
and that is to uncover the bone a second time with an instrument, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, take a drill according to this form, and let the head of iron be three-angled, and the shaft be thinned down to the tip as you see here:
then place it on the bone next to the tear duct, and move your hand a little away from the eye, then turn the drill completely until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the air comes out if he holds his hand over his nerve/nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nerve/nose;
thus it is easier for the patient.
