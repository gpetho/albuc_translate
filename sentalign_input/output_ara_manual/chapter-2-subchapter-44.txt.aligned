Either it is natural or it is acquired. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it. As for the acquired, it is of two types, one of which is similar to fatty tumors, and the other type is similar to the swelling that results from a thickening of the artery, and there is danger in incising it. So you should not approach it with the iron at all, except for what is small, if you examine and inspect it with the probe and find it similar to the fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then incise it as you incise on tumors. And extract it with what contains it of the sac if it is in a sac, and if not, then excise all of it, then treat the area with the appropriate treatment.	It is of two kinds, congenital and acquired. As to the congenital, there is no treatment for it. The acquired is of two kinds: one resembles a sebaceous cyst, the other resembles the tumour arising from an arterial aneurysm, and it is dangerous to incise it, so on no account must you apply a knife to the latter kind, except any that are small; if you try and explore them with a probe and you find they are like sebaceous cysts and not adherent to any blood-vessel, then immediately cut down upon them as you would a cyst and remove them with whatever capsule may surround them, if they are contained within a capsule; and if not, dissect away the whole accurately; then treat the place with suitable remedies.	0.8787522
