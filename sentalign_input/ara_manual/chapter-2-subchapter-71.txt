Chapter Seventy-One.
On the Excision of the Clitoris and Excess Flesh Protruding from Women's Genitalia.
The clitoris sometimes increases in size beyond the natural state, so that its appearance becomes unpleasant and ugly. And it may enlarge in some women until it spreads out like men's, and becomes suitable for intercourse.
It is necessary that you grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it. Do not go deep in cutting, especially at the root of it, lest bleeding occurs.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the protruding flesh, it is flesh that grows at the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And sometimes it protrudes outward like a tail.
Therefore some of the ancients called this ailment "the tail disease." So it is necessary that you cut it just as you cut the clitoris and treat it until it heals.
