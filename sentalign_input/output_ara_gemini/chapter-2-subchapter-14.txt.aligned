Chapter fourteen on the treatment of the fissure that occurs in the lower eyelid.	CHAPTER FOURTEEN. On the treatment of entropion of the lower lid.	0.749912
This fissure that occurs in the lower eyelid is what is truly called a fissure. It can be natural, and it can be accidental.	This inversion in the lower lid is that which is truly called entropion; and it is either congenital or acquired.	0.6020307
The accidental one results from a wound, a cut, cauterization, and the like.	It is acquired by injury or incision or cautery or something like that.	0.73667485
The way to operate on it is to take a needle with doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left corner to the right corner until the thread is at both edges of the flesh.	This is the method of operating for it: you take a needle through which has been passed a double thread and you run it into the flesh, making it penetrate from the left angle of the eye to the right angle so that the thread is fixed in flesh both ends.	0.8625345
Then you stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.	Then with the needle stretch the flesh upwards and make an incision with a broad scalpel; and if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good.	0.66872644
If the shape of the eyelid returns to how it should be, then fine; otherwise, you take a small probe and place it on the location of the fissure and turn the eyelid with it, and you make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, with the ends of the two incisions starting from the corners of the cut you made until they meet, forming an angle so that when they join, its shape becomes similar to this shape:	But if not, take a probe and put it on the site of the incision and with it turn back the lid. Then make two incisions on the inner side of the lid; the two incisions should begin from the angles of the incision already made and run together making an angle so that when they join they are like this.	0.7983758
And it is the letter lam in Greek.	It is the Greek letter lambda.	0.7628036
Then you remove that flesh as much as the sharp side of it is below what follows the eyelid. Then you gather the scattered parts with two stitches, sewing it with woolen thread.	You remove that flesh in proportion as the angled side is lower than that adjoining the lid; then bring the divided parts together with two sutures made with a woollen thread.	0.83221626
Then you treat it with what we mentioned of relaxing medicines and twisting until it heals.	Then treat with the relaxing medicaments and dressings we have mentioned, till healed.	0.8804023
And if the eyelid split occurred from an incision or stitching or cauterization, then it is necessary to make a simple incision below the hair of the eyelashes also as mentioned before. Then separate between the two lips by twisting as we mentioned.	But if the inversion is acquired, from incision, suture, or cautery, you should make a simple incision below the eyelashes, as has been described, then bring apart the two edges with a packing, as we have said.	0.8415259
The summary of the treatment of the eyelid split, if it is from above or from below, is that you perform the work according to what is available to you from the form of the eyelid split. Because it may have many differences in form.	The sum of what there is to say about the treatment of inversion, whether it is in the upper or the lower lid, is that you should make your procedure follow the actual lines of the inversion itself ; for this is of varying shape.	0.6629587
And the experienced craftsman manages the trick in any way possible until he restores the form to its natural state or close to it.	The experienced practitioner will make use of his skill in any way he can to re-establish the natural form or approximate to it.	0.7219325
The disease itself will guide you to what is suitable for it in terms of work and instruments in most cases.	The disease itself will generally indicate to you the appropriate operation and instruments.	0.79977226
