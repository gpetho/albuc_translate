In the head area, small abscesses appear, and they are like nuts in a shell, similar to a hen's yolk, and there are many types. Some are fatty and some contain moisture like pus; and some are hard and stony to cut, and there is no doubt if the artery does not interfere. And the procedure for cutting is that you test with an instrument called "entromissoire," whose form is given hereafter, to see what it contains. For if it contains moisture, then cut it lengthwise. And when the moisture is emptied, then scrape without leaving any skin that contains that moisture, for it returns quickly if anything is left; then soak cotton in Egyptian ointment if available; if not, in water and salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day; and this drains what remains of the moisture. Then repeat the cotton treatment as before, the second day, and the third, until you are sure there is no moisture left; then treat the wound with suitable ointment until it is healed. And if the abscess contains a fatty core, cut it in this form, lengthwise; and insert your hooks, and scrape it from all sides, and focus all your effort on extracting the core where it lies; and if the artery interferes, do what I told you later. And do the same for the abscess if it is stony, and for cutting and treating as I have described.
And the cutting of the stony and moist abscess is easier, for they contain little blood. And there are some of these abscesses in the head where there is no moisture, and such was an abscess I cut in the head of an old woman; and I found the abscess like a flint stone, rough and white, and could not break it; and if someone had struck it, they would have made a wound as if on a stone. In other abscesses occurring on the head, except those that come on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, to allow the pus to exit; and treat them as necessary.
