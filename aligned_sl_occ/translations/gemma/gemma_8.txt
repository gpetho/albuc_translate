O offspring, know that I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, for the praise of it, and for the praise of its practices, and for the pronouncements of its author, it is because I wish to instruct you in this book that which is part of my art, that is surgery.
For surgery is very rare in our region and in our time, so that it is a thing that is almost lost; and its knowledge is very little, and the greatest part of it has perished; and it remains only a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which change most of all and bring about those errors and hesitations that exist until their causes are understood and the force and the art are prolonged
And it is seen by me that I have composed this treatise in such a way as to follow the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and that it should be added to the forms of the instruments of cautery and other instruments of the work, as well as for the addition of the declaration, and for the preparation of it, which is necessary.
The cause why no good artist is found in this our time for the surgery of the hand is that the art of medicine is long, and that it covers many actors who have not been exercised in the science of anatomy, who do not know the bones, the nerves, and the lacerations, and the number of them, and their structure; and the knowledge of the veins and arteries, and the places of their origin and termination.</start_turn>
And thus says Hippocrates that I have no name, but in the small work more than in the great work, and especially in the art of the hand.
And indeed we have already said in the introduction of this book that whoever is not learned in anatomy is not worthy of being called a physician, for they will cause the death of many men, as I have seen in many instances, for many of them are formed in this science and depart from this science and its experiments.</start_turn
For I have seen a foolish and inept physician who has incised a scrofula on the heel of a woman, and has ligated some arteries of the heel so that there flowed great blood within her, and the woman died between her thighs.
And I have seen another physician who thought he could pull out a stone from a man’s belly which had been there for a long time, and the stone was large, and he came to take it out with a hook, and the man died on the third day.
And I have already mentioned this, and I saw that because of the greatness of the stone and the condition of the patient, he knew that he would die
And I have seen another physician who took charge of surgery for a duke from our land, and he entrusted him with a black slave who was his servant; and the physician, in his ignorance, opened the fracture, over the wound, with sponges and sticks of great strength, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And thus I forbade him according to his desires, and I released him, and I commanded that he should be relieved for a few days and be given rest; and this happened until the wound burst out, and he perished
And I went to see him, and I saw that I had to take away the ligature, and there was peace and an end to the pain.</start_turn><end_turn>
But indeed corruption was already confirmed in the limb, for I could not restrain that, and I did not cease to wander the corruption in the limb until the patient perished.
And I have seen another physician who perforated an abscess of cancer, and it bled profusely from the beginning, until the malignancy of it grew greater than that of the master of the house
The cause of this is that cancer is pure melancholic humor, and that it does not suffice to remove it from the limb in which it has settled, but that it must be treated in the limb in which it is to be found.
And thus, offspring, it is necessary for you that the surgery of the hand be divided into two parts: that is, in surgery which is associated with health, and in work which is perilous in the greatest precautions
And I have already spoken of this in all places of this book in which I have mentioned surgery in which there is error and fear; for it is necessary for you to retain this and to leave that, so that the fools do not find fault with you and you do not become discouraged.
Therefore take the rest of the arms in the request and in the protection of God, and the rest of the diseases in the facility and in the firmness.
E use the way of the Lord in grace, and praiseworthy succession, and lay aside the grievous diseases of difficult healing, and finally the other weapons of that which you fear, so that your salvation may rest in your faith and in your name: for may your might remain to your glory, and above all in heaven and behind the saints.
Indeed, I have already mentioned several times in various discourses: “There is no medicine for a bad disease, so that no doctor will be called by that name”.
And I have already discussed this book according to three chapters.
Begin the division of the book, and first of the first part The first chapter deals with the parts of the foot, in the forms of instruments and the utensils of the cautery, and what is necessary for the operation
Division of the second part The second chapter deals with swelling and perforation, and of blisters, and of wounds, and of the extraction of arrows and similar to those, all categorized and ordered by the forms of the instruments
The third chapter deals with restoration and dislocation, and with the care of fractures and similar to those; the chapter is categorized from the head to the foot, and by the forms of the instruments
So I say what is the quality of the instruments of that cautery and of their documents, and in what combination it is prohibited to cauterize.
Therefore I say that the speech about the quality of the cautery instruments and their documents is a long and elaborate one, and subtle for science, and a secret hidden; and already many savants have spoken greatly of it, and they have disagreed with each other, and to me it seems that a small part of their speeches is sufficient, fearing prolongation.
Therefore I say that cautery is permissible in all its universality with regard to its matter or its matter, except for two qualifications, which are qualifications that refer to its matter
In the cold and dry matter there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is useful for that, while others say that it is harmful for that, because the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that the disease be cold and dry along with that which is being cauterized and dried.
And those who say the opposite, that by cautery is useful for any cold and dry disease that is in the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of a man with the humidity of his body with the quality of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
And I say concerning this speech that I have already experimented with it several times and discovered it
But I do not say that everything that is said above is to be taken for granted; for it is necessary to know the practice of cautery after exercise, and to be acquainted with the diversity of the qualities of men and the disposition of diseases in their bodies, and the causes of those, and the accidents of those, and the time space of those
In other qualifications, it is not about you to fear, and especially in cold and humid diseases, for already all doctors have agreed on those, and they do not disagree in the usefulness of cautery in those
And know, children, that the secret of curing with fire cautery is not in the power of fire, but in the gentleness of fire, for the action of the fire does not reach beyond the part which is cauterized and does not touch anything else except for the small document.
And the action of external medicine reaches only to that part of the limb from which it is applied, and it makes it strong for the diseased part of the limb of difficult healing and makes it strong to leave
But the fire, for its smallness and for its gentleness, does nothing other than what we already know by experience and by the length of our studies concerning the truth of the causes; and for this reason I am excused for the length of this speech, for it is not fitting for me to reveal this secret of yours concerning fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies and the safety of its expulsion for which it expels diseases, as a philosophical demonstration, which would be acute in the remaining passages.
The best translation is:
I say that cautery is suitable at all times, for thus it does not harm the time of the accident when it is immersed in the benefit of water that makes the cautery more painful, especially if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, which do not suffer from delay, for it is feared that those that come late will bring malice, which is greater than the slight discomfort of coming at the right time.</end_of_turn>
I do not deny, friends, that sometimes the people of the vulgar sort, or rather the fools of the doctors, do not esteem anything except for the common people and the poor peasants. So it is with that disease which is cured by cautery, for it is not ridiculous at all times, and one should stop at that consequence.</end_of_turn>
And the cause is not that they give it for water, for cautery is nothing but a medicine that alters the composition and dries the humors which are the cause of pain.</end_of_turn
Moreover, cautery surpasses medicine for the delight of its value and the virtue of its operation and the greatness of the Lord's mercy.</end_of_turn>
It is possible that the disease will return at any time of life, according to the composition of the disease and the location of the disease, and the virtue of the treatments, and what is prepared in the body from the abundance of humors in the body, and what is brought to the body in food and drink, and from those causes; but when the disease is treated with cautery, it is a subtle disease in a few superfluous humors and moisture, just as if it were cautery for toothache.
Therefore it is better to speak vulgarly that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and is a speech of great prudence, not as those understand it who do not know it, for they believe that it is not a cure that uses either medicine or any other cause except for cautery.
On the contrary; and the understanding that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is true only when the methods of treatment of certain diseases are administered, and those medicines do not suffice, and when the cause is in some way overcome, it is appropriate to administer cautery, and to take advantage of that.</end_of_turn And thus it is clear that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding which the vulgar people and the fools of the doctors have of it.</end_of_turn>
The ancients say that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and I do not say anything else except for the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance.</end_of_turn>
I say that the place of cautery does not make it harmful, as some falsely believe, for I have already seen that it does no harm to any limb except for the other, and that cautery with gold is better than that with iron; however, when you make cautery with fire from gold, you must take care that the fire is not too strong, for if you adjust too much fuel to the fire, the gold will burn for the fire; and if you take away some of the fuel, the operator will burn his hands for lack of fuel.
Therefore, when you make cautery with iron you must place it more gently and more cautiously on the rectitude of the operation.
I have already arranged this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have arranged those that are between the feet so that I may satisfy the request of those who demand it of me.</end_of_turn>
Chapter one.</end_of_turn>
This cautery confers relief from cold and moisture concerning the accidental cause of the which two causes, so is the cause of soda and the multitude of rheumatic fluxes, swelling of the marrow, of the head to the limbs of the heels and the flowing urine, and the multitude of sleep, and toothache and gut pain, and universally of all diseases that arise from cold, even as paralysis, suffocation and apoplexy, and is similar in those diseases.</end_of_turn
The form of this cautery is as follows: first command the patient to evacuate with laxatives for three or four nights, according to the excess of the virtue of the disease and the age and custom of the patient.</end_of_turn
And then command him to shave his head with a razor, and then do that which must be done between your thighs on a fallen bench and that you place your hands on your feet.</end_of_turn
And then hold the razor of your palm near the root of the nose between the toes of your feet.</end_of_turn May be, since the sick person has mentioned the area of the ankle is affected, the sign of the ankle is that the fire is there: and immediately ignite the olive oil of which this is the shape.
And immediately stop that over the area that is affected, in such a way that it slowly descends, and your hand is slightly constricted, and you will rotate that
And immediately lift your hand slightly and support the area, and if you see that already some quantity of the head of the bone is exposed, as much as the quantity of barley grains, then elevate your hand, and if you do not turn your hand away from that side, from the other side, if it is cooled down, enter until you see that amount of bone that I have told you about.
And immediately take a little of salt and dissolve it over the area and let it stay for three days.
And immediately stop over the knee bent in the border and let it stay until the burn of the fire is destroyed And immediately apply the four remedies to the area until it is healed
And indeed when the plague remains open, better take off the sleeve, for it is better and more useful
I say to you all that the heel must be cauterized until the bone, and must be held cauterized until every part of the substance of the bone is consumed.
And immediately both that which is pressed against the bone and that which is cured
And I say to you that it must be cauterized behind, until it almost reaches the bone, so that when it is pressed against the bone it makes the bone strong, and this is the way of making an incision that is not too deep. And it is estimated that from that area the vapor of the head escapes.
And if the plague remains open for a long time, and finally it is cured, it must be consolidated
I do not see these two ways of cauterizing in all my life, but in some men for fear; and leave that, you must know, is better for health than to cause the head to be swollen by continuous application, just as we have testified in other members, and even more so when the head of the patient is of a cold nature
The first way of cauterizing is better and more useful, you must know; and from that one I have seen better results in this work than from this one.

Of the cauterization of the head.
When in all the head chronic and long-lasting pain occurs and the disease is prolonged, and you use herbs and poultices and compresses and patches and sponges and garlic and onions and vinegar and mustard, and especially if it has already been cauterized with a cautery that reports and does not benefit from any of those causes, then consider that if the head of the disease is of strong constitution in its nature; and that it is not cold and finds no great heat, then you should cauterize with another cautery leaving a little space between them. And immediately cauterize over the heel of the foot until the bone is fractured Cut the bone and uncover from the bone the quantity that we have recounted and cauterize that which is in the lower part of the head in the area where the veins are closed, — and that is the place where the wind is stopped. And withdraw your hand quickly in support, and do not uncover the bone, for the disease by that will find great pain different from the pain of all the other cauteries of the head
I say this cautery in this place, because it covers that which must be cauterized with the one which has already been cauterized, that is the corn of the head and the occipital bone is more subtle a cauterize than that which is cauterized in the middle of the head; and this is the way of doing it
End of text
Of the cauterization of an ancient hernia.
When inside the head there is soft pain, or is prolonged pain in the groin, evacuate immediately with medicines that strengthen the head, and administer the other treatment which I have mentioned in the conditions of diseases; and if that does not help, then the cauterization of the area is in two ways: either with acute medicine that burns, or with a needle
Better is the cauterization with acute medicine than that with alcohol, for you take a spoonful of vinegar and expel that and remove the extremities of it from both heads And thus strike the area of the pain on the temple with a lancet that is in the area of the pain itself, so that the cordene is not visible.
And keep pressure on it for a while to constrict, and leave it for three hours; then remove the ligature and take away the dressing, and leave the wound covered for two or three days, and keep your hand over it until the pain subsides.
And care for that which is engorged until it is healed
And if you wish, know that there are many medicines that combat these which I have written in the previous treatise on medicines that combat them
May the cautery be done with iron in this manner: fire for the cautery of which this is the form:
and is called closed clamps, which has a head like a nail in which there is a small prominence in the middle.
And keep your hand over the area of the pain, and hold your hand – that the dressing is not torn which is left – and slowly rotate the iron little by little with speed
And if the quantity that is adhered by the specification of the cordene is as much as most of it, elevate your hand so that the artery is not torn which is left, so that there is no flow of blood
And immerse the wound in salt water and leave it on the area for three days; then cover the area with a dressing and care for it until it is healed
And if you wish, cauterize at the extremity of the cuticle according to the incision, and keep the incision of the artery in this outward movement properly not antiquated.
Chapter four
Of the cautery of the inward movement of the artery
When you have cured the artery according to what has been said of the previous treatment and what has been said in the divisions of the diseases, and you do not profit from the treatment, and sometimes for the disease that does not suffice for it as much as the first treatment with medicine or the cautery with fire, then know that you must ignite the cautery of the nail until it is white, for it signifies that over the area of the pain along the line of length of which is the greatest part of the finger, or whatever; and withdraw your hand for a while and hold it until you have inciscated the artery and arrived at the bone
However necessary is that you guard the continuity of the mandible, which is praised for chewing, and that the nerve not be torn and that the muscles not be damaged, and that no spasm occur
And if it is about the custody and care of the flow of blood of the artery that is being cauterized, because in the cautery of it there is fear, and especially for that one who ignores what is done and is not studied and is reckless; leave the operation to the beginning
And I come to remind you of the regimen of the flow of blood concerning the accident of the artery according to its custom
And if you see this disease that does not benefit from this cautery and you see the body of the patient tolerable, cauterize that in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and care for the wound until it is healed
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have said in the chapter of the stretching of the artery with two clamps, and this is better cautery and more reliable
Chapter five
Of the cautery of the pains of the heel
When in the heel there is pain from cold and is cured by means of lacatives and by the other treatment which I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then know that you must ignite the cautery, and this is the one that has no point, of which this is the form:
And strike the point near the ignition, and be careful around the whole heel as if it were rotating, or around the circumference of any abscess if the pain is in any place Along with you the cautery of the root of the heel little by little because you have seen that you have marked the area with the finger.
And if you have made ten points all around the heel, and what is that, and care for the wounds until they are healed
Chapter six
From cautery of the torus.
The torus which is cured by cautery is not anything other than the species which cause inflammation, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.</end_of_turn>
Avoid cautery of the species which must be dried or whose nerves are spastic.</end_of_turn>
When you have cured that species of torus, immerse the limb in hot water and cover it with oil, and keep it warm, without removing the dressing, until you have cauterized with three cautery instruments: the first you must touch the root of the nail, the second a little beyond the nail, and the third at the junction of the two lips.</end_of_turn
And keep the cautery away from the opposite side of the painful area, because mollification does not take effect except in the part where the pain is healed.</end_of_turn
And the manner of cautery is that you cauterize that which is black in the root of the nail while you hold a little over the head of the toe, and in the temple another, the length of which is according to the length of the finger without going beyond. Stop your hand with the cautery until the quantity of the matter of the species of the code has been consumed.</end_of_turn
And this is the form of cautery, and it is the species of the cautery, the form of which is like a knife with a flat blade.</end_of_turn More subtle is that one which a little always sees; and cover in it of excessive thickness a little.</end_of_turn
And keep the area around the limb in water which is like a bath until it is healed.</end_of_turn
End of text.</end_of_turn>
From cautery of ancient apoplexy.</end_of_turn>
When the apoplexia is ancient and you have cured that which we have said, and do not fear your medicine and the patient has no fever, then cauterize that with four cautery instruments: over all the nails of the foot; and in the head of the foot as we have said; and in the heel.</end_of_turn And the manner of the cautery is sufficient as we have said.</end_of_turn
And it is already cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is better delayed; and keep it cured with water which proceeds.</end_of_turn
End of text.</end_of_turn>
From cautery for temporary forgetfulness caused by inflammation.</end_of_turn
Keep the patient calm in the beginning with large doses and give him pills that serve to moderate.</end_of_turn
And keep the patient's head all around the patient and stop their teeth from biting them in the area described in the treatise on dressings.</end_of_turn
And stop any herbs, because that is the manner of cautery.</end_of_turn And do the water according to that method or which I have already said.</end_of_turn
And thus if for those who are well it is good; and if not, then do three cauteries in the back part of the foot, which depend on the part most superior of the head until the part most distant from the heel.</end_of_turn And stop between each cautery the thickness of the finger, and keep the cautery warm with the water which proceeds.</end_of_turn
More if you are addicted and the patient is tolerant, then do the cautery in the middle of the foot; and if you want more addiction, then cauterize that over the two nails.</end_of_turn
Keep the area around the limb until it is healed; and the cautery olive oil according to the manner described before.</end_of_turn
End of text.</end_of_turn
From cautery of nails and mollification of the whole body.</end_of_turn
Keep the process of calming the head with warmth and water as we have said; and keep the patient's head close to the patient, and cauterize that in the middle of the foot, and over all the nails of the foot, and over the back part of the limb, and with three cauteries over the vertebrae of the heel.</end_of_turn
And if it is necessary in the disease of the mollification of the body of the tropics that this one and the other patients are tolerant and the disease is strong, then cauterize that with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the buttocks, and then keep it cauterized until it is consumed by the matter of the code.

When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and great heat, then cauterize that which we have said should be cauterized while maintaining paralysis.

Incideys am cauteri totas las venas e arcerias las quals so dejos la codena; e sian les cauteris en aquela lonh en la latitut de las templas.
And guard yourself from the flow of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see that there is still blood flowing, stop any medicine that you may have given.
And I would add that you must have knowledge of the extraction of arteries and the excision of those, as well as being careful of the flow of blood.</start_of_turn>

Of the cautery of ancient tears.</start_of_turn
When tears from the eyes are ancient, and are collected by the veins and arteries that are in the area of the forehead and it is verified that these are superfluous fatty phlegmas, then cauterize the one that we have recounted in the chapter on the commencement of water, and at the middle of the head and at two points in the cervix leaving two temples, and at two points in the cervix leaving two bones.</start_of_turn And if you are doubtful, then cauterize that which is throughout the breadth of the cheek over the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.</start_of_turn

Chapter XV.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of the softening of the eyelids of the eyes.</start_of_turn
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by disease or humidity, then you cauterize that eyelid with a cautery with a lunar shape; and this is the form of it:
And if you wish, cauterize over the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries throughout, and they will be elongated from the temples.</start_of_turn And the length of each cautery should be according to the quantity of the eyebrow.</start_of_turn
And do not press too much your hand with the cautery, but according to the quantity that the third part of the eyelid is adhered.</start_of_turn
Chapter XVI.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of the eye when the pupil is converted into parts and the pupil is put out of the eye.</start_of_turn
When the pupils of the eye are converted into parts as soon as the pupil is put out of the eye, cauterize in those two ways, either by making or by medicine that burns.</start_of_turn
If you cauterize with fire, command the patient to drink while the pupils are reading those that move them, until they are prolonged and equal; and if you put out the eye, then strengthen the eyes of the patient with a bandage so that it is not painful until the pupils are born.</start_of_turn
When the pupils are born and equal, then you pause the head of the patient in the gut and approach again over the eye of the patient with your hand, with a signal that is according to the figure of the holly leaf, and that is the beginning of the signal at the edge of the pupil.</start_of_turn
And approach slowly from behind with a bandage of wool or with mucus of fish over the eye.</start_of_turn
And approach quickly the cautery of which this is the form.</start_of_turn
And approach cauterizing over the figure that you have signaled, little by little, in burnt patches, until the surface of the bone that is just like a holly leaf is completely burned out, quite openly indeed.</start_of_turn
The sign of safety in your work is that you see the pupil of the eye already contracted and the eyelids elevated above the puncture of the eye.
Therefore raise your hand and place it there for three days, and keep your hand resting on the edge until the wound is healed.</end_of_turn> And take care of that which is swollen until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if it returns for any reason, then immediately remove the swelling and soften the pupil, for the hour will come again when you will make the puncture once more.</end_of_turn
Maybe if the swelling is in the pupil, then immediately cauterize that until it is raised to its natural level and is equalized, and that the pupil does not touch the eye again.</end_of_turn>
Maybe the cautery will suffice for the medicine because you command the patient to rest the swelling until it is prolonged and equalized, and you will make the mark of the cautery in the form of a leaf of ivy.</end_of_turn
And take a piece of lint with a little bit of ointment and put it in the wound.</end_of_turn> namely.</end_of_turn> Or what you will, mix these things together, and make a fasting for so that it is not inflamed; and expand a little of that over the mark which is made like a leaf of ivy, and place that on the eye or both; and keep the eye covered in a bag of wine, and the head of the patient is in the thigh.</end_of_turn
And keep saying about the medicine and give it a little bit and do not touch it until the patient feels the bitterness of the medicine, which is in them just like fire.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you perceive that the other bitterness has ceased, then read the medicine and do not touch it until I tell you that; when the bitterness has ceased, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and consider that sometimes the pupil is already raised just like after being washed over the constriction caused by fire or incision, for the hour this is good; and if it does not return from the medicine over the area where you did not imprint the medicine and it does not fall down until the operation is healed and the pupil is contracted.</end_of_turn
And keep your hand resting on the edge until the swelling of the wound has disappeared, and take care of that which is swollen again until it is healed.
It is necessary for you to know that you must keep your eye on the eye so that no more medicine falls into it, and if the pupil is somewhat days softened by any cause of the swelling of the eye, then repeat your medicine over that area which was softened, just as you did at the beginning, and do not delay until it is healed.</end_of_turn
This is the form of a ivy leaf.</end_of_turn
You know that the humors of men are diverse according to their magnitude and their thinness, and therefore according to what is useful for your contraction.</end_of_turn>
And do not be ashamed of the way of proceeding in this art.</end_of_turn
Chapter XVII.</end_of_turn>
Of cauterization of the fistula that is in the lacrimal of the eye.</end_of_turn
When you treat the fistula with that which we have said in the divisions of the diseases and you do not confide your care, then you must know that you must cauterize that in the following manner: command the patient to keep their head down in the thigh, and hold the head of the patient by any minister between the thighs in such a manner that it is not stifled or shaken at the head of the patient.</end>
And keep the eye covered in a bag of wine or in mucus on the eye of the patient.</end_of_turn
And take the cautery of which this is the form:

And if you will, penetrate through to the other extremity.</end_of_turn And if you wish, you can also remove it like this.</start_of_turn
However, that which is conquered is better for the work.</end_of_turn
And immediately close the fistula if it is open, and bring healing to it and dry that.</end_of_turn If it is not opened, then open that and extract the purulent discharge from it.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And hold your hand a little below the nose, so that your hand does not move or the patient becomes agitated, and when you have finished, remove the cautery from the wound and close it up with whatever is necessary.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, if at the beginning of the incision the bone has already entered, it is not good; but if not, repeat the incision once or twice, if necessary; and leave that for three days. And then place your hand over that area around the border and send it out dry until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Even if it has been several days and it is not healed, then place over it corrosive acute medicine until the bone is uncovered and is as it should be according to what is said in the capital chapter.</end_of_turn>
And another way of cautering a fistula is as follows: enter the location of the fistula and make that opening and then place your hand in that rough cavernous space of which is the form of it: and put in that the quantity of the black pepper seeds that are found; and hold your hand firmly in place, so that the patient does not faint due to the smell of that; and cover the face of the patient with a cushion filled with hay or in water, so that the pepper seeds do not reach the nose of that.</end_of_turn
And if the fistula is healed with what has been said of the cautery and the treatment, it is not good; but if not, it is necessary to administer medicine through the nose and reduce the fistula to the root of the nose according to what is appropriate in that location.</end_of_turn

Many times accidental incisions occur in the lips, and more especially in the lips of children.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you cure those incisions with what has been said in the divisions and do not neglect your treatment, then do the following:
And be the concavity of it according to the softness of the flesh.</end_of_turn

When in the root of the uvula or on the palate or in the roots of the teeth there is swelling and it is broken, and it is old, and there is a fistula, and you neglect the treatment, then cover that and do not neglect treatment. Then ignite the cautery according to the quantity that is received in the fistula, and put that flame in the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand over that until the flame reaches the root of it, and after that do it once or twice. And take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of cautering of the teeth and of softening of the arteries.</end_of_turn
When the arteries are softened by humidity and the teeth are blackened, and you treat those with medicines and do not confer them, then place your hand over the patient's cheek in the neck and do the following: ignite the cautery in the shape that will come to you, and while you are holding that place your hand over the tooth so that the flame does not reach the root of the tooth being cauterized.</end_of_turn
And then take away your hand and repeat the cautery several times as you wish.</end_of_turn
And then rinse the patient's mouth with salt water and keep it there for an hour, and then remove it, because the blackened tooth is stopped and the softened gum is strengthened and the humidity that was corrupted is dried up.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXI.</end_of_turn
Of cautering of toothache.</end_of_turn
When toothache is caused by cold, or if it is cold or warm, or if you do not comply with the treatment with medicine, then the cautery is used in two ways: either at the edge of the cows or at the fire.
The cautery is applied at the edge of the cows (lip of the tooth) or at the fire (hot iron).
And thus repeat the process until the force of the fire reaches the root of the tooth
If you wish, immerse wool or cotton in the border of the tooth and place it over the painful tooth, and place your hand over the iron until the iron reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.
However, the cautery with the iron is more dangerous than with the cows or the flame, for it must be observed when the air or the iron is too hot, and that in the belly of the patient there is any swelling or pain.
And thus remove the form which comes from the cautery, and place your hand over the tooth until the cautery is cool; and do whatever it takes for the pain to disappear, whether on that day or the next day or the day after
And so it is commanded that the patient should fill his mouth with good butter for an hour and then remove it; and this is the way of the cautery
And cauterize as much as you are able according to your means
This is the way of the cannula:

Of the cautery of exostoses.</start_of_turn>
When exostoses are of flexibility and cold humors and do not submit to digestion by medicines, then you must cauterize them slightly. For this purpose, hold two fingers closed so as to protect the surrounding parts from the fumes of the cautery, and place the ignited iron on the apex of the excrescence for a single herb, or two if you think it necessary, until the iron reaches the depth of the excrescence.
And if the excrescence is small, then pause the cautery according to the quantity of the excrescence, and apply a compress for three days and place your hand over it covered with butter until it is consumed what the fire has burned
And take care that the gum, the nails, and the clothes are not damaged until it is healed

Of the cautery of the voice and the constriction of the throat
When humidity is over the root of the lung, and especially when it is of cold composition, then it is necessary to evacuate the patient with laxatives at the beginning of treatment, and then cauterize that which is under the edge of the epiglottis in the depressed area.</start_of_turn>
And take care that you do not reach the epiglottis with the cautery or that you do not burn the cord of the voice, but only a little.</start_of_turn>
And cauterize that which is another cautery to be made at the junction of the cartilage of the collar with the last vertebra of the neck.</start_of_turn And the cautery of the collarbone is carried out as before.</start_of_turn

Of the cautery of the pulmonary disease and cough
When cough and pulmonary disease are of cold humidity and the patient has neither fever nor chills and is an old disease, then cauterize twice on the furcula in the depressed areas of the lung and between two nipples; and make the cautery of the collarbone as before.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, make the punctures with the cautery that is called punctate, of the form which is described in the puncture of heel pain.</start_of_turn
And do the punctures inside the cavity as well as outside; and take care that what precedes is done until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And thus the cautery should not have three ramps, for the cautery is at that point: one should make three cauteries in this way:
And thus the cautery should not have three ramps, for the cautery is at that point: one should make three cauteries in this way:
And thus the cautery should not have three ramps, for the cautery is at that point: one should make three cauteries in this way: from the cautery of the little toe which is the head of the assistant.
When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to greasy humidity and is not fixed at the time of the setting sun, you must return its dislocation until it returns by itself as it is commonly known. And thus by a slight movement it is displaced again as soon as it has gone, as we have testified. Therefore, when the dislocation first occurs, you must first reduce it, and then restore the patient either face down or on the side; and raise the heel which is in the groin of the little toe to the parts below, if the joint is dislocated downwards.
And thus the cautery should not have two heads; and this is the way to do it:
And thus the cautery should not have two heads; and thus cauterize the heel until it penetrates the other side; and the figure of the cautery will be that of four heads of cautery.
And every fold is adjusted according to this count and because there are eight cauteries
And thus keep your hand over the cautery pores with salt, and make the patient adhere to tranquility, and the limb should not be moved for any time until it is comforted
And if the dislocation is to the lower parts and it is urgent, then cauterize over the muscle at the head of the cautery or with several pointed cauteries, so that the joint is confirmed and the humidity is reduced and the patient is healed.
Capitol XXVVI.
Of the cautery of the stomach.
When there is cold and moist humors in the stomach that cause swelling and multiply the worms in it, and if you continue your treatment methods and do not confirm them, then you must make the patient lie face down, extend their limbs and buttocks, and make three cauteries: one on the heel leaving the toes for the amount of a finger at the head of the cautery, and two on the two sides of the cautery, until the triangular figure of the cautery is formed; and lengthen between those that are not adjusted that will make the wound less painful.
And if the depth of the cautery is the amount of two-thirds of the thickness of the heel
And the figure of the cautery is as follows: these are additional cauteries. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach as follows; and this is a circle cautery as follows:
And the stomach should be cauterized point by point at that point where it is most sensitive. And you should mark on the stomach point by point according to the amount you wish on the hair, and then cauterize at those points; and take care of that which precedes until it is healed.
Capitol XXVVII
Of the cautery of the painful heel
When there is pain in the heel due to cold or moisture or for excessive wind, and the normal swelling of the limb is expelled by excessive discharge, and when the patient has been treated as we have said and has not recovered, then you must make the patient lie face down on their neck, and mark with three cauteries as follows and with this quantity above the heel beyond the hip bones, honing the heel of man.
And the space between each cautery is according to the thickness of the finger, and the cauteries are according to the length of the limb that is being treated
And do not touch the patient with the cautery more than necessary
And if the quantity of the liquid that is adhered to the quantity of the great toe of the foot, and it is not adjusted; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then you must hold still, which has already extended their buttocks, and lift the thighs.
And you may also cauterize these cauteries with a pointed cautery, when it is in your wisdom and prudence in the art
Keep the cautery moving steadily and do not linger too long in one place, so that the entire area of the body is cauterized and reaches the underlying tissue. Be aware that the codena here is subtle; take note of that.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
From perforation of the abscess of the foot with the cautery.
When swelling or abscess in the foot occurs and you wish to know whether that abscess is in the flesh of the foot or in its membrane, if it is in the flesh of the foot, the pain is severe and the swelling is acute
And if it is in the membrane of the foot, with great pain which often makes doctors despair of its cure
Therefore the patient should be placed in a sitting position; and gently touch the area of the abscess with the hand; and immediately cauterize with the cautery that is like a rag, as its form is described in the other book. And cauterize until the entire body is cauterized, until it reaches the bone, until the ulcer has healed.
And take care of the other abscesses until they have healed.
Do not use this method of cautery except for those that have been studied in the art of medicine, and in most of which numerous diseases are known; for in these cases it may cause more harm than benefit. However, in some cases it is necessary to perform this operation, even though we must read and heed the warnings that are given to us.

On cauterizing of the pleura.
I say that the old cauteries of the roots of Aristotle towards the pleura are to be made according to this manner: take from the roots of Aristotle a long thin splinter that is found, and that is of the thickness of a finger
And immerse that in oil and burn that at the fire, and immediately cauterize at that place which is between the continuation of the furcula and the ribs; and with two small cauteries leave guiding, one slightly declining towards the part that is beyond the beard, and two cauteries in that which is declining between the fifth rib and the twelfth, declining slightly towards the back; and another cauterization in the middle of the foot; and another over the stomach, and three cauterizations of the back parts; and one cauterization in that place which is between the two scapulae, and two cauterizations of the two sides of the foot, leaving the cauterization which is between two scapulae.
And do not hold your hand over the cautery, but rather keep the manifestation of the body in work
And I say that the old men say that they are the ones who use cautery like iron rays and fire, and that they put that in that place which is between the ribs, until that abscess is gone and is cured, as we have said in the abscess of the foot
However, in this perforation with the cautery there is no fear, for so many people have already died in that place that does not heal.

On the cauterization of the melsa
When you cure the disease of the melsa with what we have said of the care in the division, and do not entrust your care, then the cauterization in it is according to three methods, which are all safe, of which one is to make three or four lines according to the length of the melsa according to the figure of the cauteries of the foot, the figure of which has preceded
And between each cautery let the thickness be that of a finger or a little more, and the manner of the cautery is the manner that we have said in the cautery of the foot equally
And do not hold your hand over the cautery; and the patient should be even more about the two hips
And another manner of cauterizing is that you ignite the cautery having two lifters, which cause we have said in the chapter of dislocation of the muscle, and elevate the limb which is at the end of the melsa so that it does not touch the belly of the patient on the left side
The elevation should be at the level of the hip bone according to the length of the limb, so that the cautery can be performed according to the width of the body.
And now bring together the two veins, ignite one, in that part where they penetrate the hip bone from the other side
And then extract the cautery; and so there will be four cauteries in total
And if you wish, cauterize at the cautery that has three veins
And then keep the cautery still after it has bled for a while, because it is different from the other previous causes in treatment

On the cautery of hydrops.
The cautery does not burn in hydrops but in the substance itself
When you have cured the hydrops in the ways of treatment that we have said in the division and you do not confer your treatment, then know that four cauteries should be made around the belly and one on the stomach, one on the heel, one between the vertebrae of the two, and two on the thigh, and one on the buttock And the quantity of the depth of the cautery should be in proportion to the thickness of the hip bone
And then keep the cautery covered so that it does not bleed for a long time
Do not evacuate the patient from treatment along with the cautery while it is covered, so that two meanings are not added to it, and do not feed it until the helper is healed.
The shape of the cautery that is to be made on the belly is like a clove, as it is the shape that has gone before, and that in which two olives are cauterized as they go before their shape.

This is how the cautery is to be made: make two cauteries on the two thighs, and in any part where there is a large cautery at the extremity of the cautery cut And the cautery should be according to the length of the thigh: leave the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and make two cauteries on each thigh

If you suspect that the patient's stomach is inflamed, the food is not digested, and the face is sometimes pale, then cauterize the area above the stomach with a large cautery as before; and on the heel, and on the belly of the patient with a nail cautery. Keep the cautery on for some time until it is healed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.

About the cautery of fistulas that are useful in nature in the parts of the body.
When nature does not obey the work that we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened of it, whether it is healthy or not
Therefore, when anyone sees a fistula in nature that is old, corrupted by dirt and humidity, and therefore more deserving of treatment than to cover it up, then do so with little attempt, and with less quantity of the depth of the wound that with greater.
Like a nail cautery. And put that cautery on that fistula, and according to the quantity with which you attempt the attempt
And do it until those corrupt parts are burned out, two or three times, according to the quantity of your need
Be careful not to burn nerves or veins; or if the fistula is on the bladder or belly, then keep away from all those places; do not proceed until the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it is not penetrating
And take care of the wound until it is healed
And if the wound is sealed, and so removed from its matter, and remains closed for a long time, then know that it is already completely healed
And if the matter is not removed from it, know that it is penetrating or in the preparation of corruption, or that it comes from those causes for which it will be remembered in its place

Then cover that you cauterize the disease on the part of the ankle with a pointed cautery, because you have seen that it is necessary to make a circular incision around the part to avoid that the part falls flat.</end_turn
And the incision which precedes the cautery is of the kind which is made in the cautery of the stomach.</end_turn

When there is pain in the part of the ankle, and it is caused by cold and humors, the disease is cured with what we have said and do not confer, and when it is old, that you remove the disease from the humors with solid pills or artificial or similar pills; and do the cautery.</end_turn
And the manner of the cautery is in two ways: either with medicinal substances that consume, or with fire.</end_turn
The other is that you make three triangular incisions on the part of the ankle according to this form; and do with these good depth.</end_turn And the space which is between each incision is as much as the thickness of the finger and if the cautery is olive or large.</end_turn
Many people see the cautery on the middle of the ankle over the head of the ankle because there are four cauteries.</end_turn
And if you will, cauterize around the circle which precedes the form of the dislocation of the ankle, and which is a continuous circle and consumes the spiciness of the whole thigh.</end_turn
And this is the manner of cautery in sciatica when the pain is adhered to the ankle and does not extend into the swelling.</end_turn
And if it extends into the swelling, then do two cauteries on the swelling over the foot where you send the disease which is the pain; and one cautery on the heel for four fingers a little beyond the wrist.</end_turn
And if the cautery is burning, and the depth of the cautery is according to the quantity of the spiciness of the thigh.</end_turn
And if the disease sends that the pain is extended into the foot near the toes, then do the cautery here where you send the cautery with three points or four or more if you wish.</end_turn
And if the disease sends that the pain is left when the swelling is seen, then do the cautery here with a burning cautery.</end_turn
And keep this in mind in all cauteries that you do not finish with the cautery while you burn nerves or great arteries, and that for which reason you must be over the disease without causing any damage or contraction.</end_turn
And I have already seen others who have cauterized on the heel and finished with the cautery, and the limb burned up until the tumor achieved the foot, and the limb perforated and corrupted all the foot.</end> And take strong solution of vinegar, and thus the death.</end_turn
And if the pain is in two parts together do each according to this manner.</end_turn

And join that circle with another third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of the nail of the thumb; and these circles are closed with two parts; and let the length of these nails be a nail or two, and do in these marks of iron conveniently placed in the circles; and this is the form of them.</end_turn

And thus leave it for three days; then apply a plaster to that border and leave the wound open for several days; and finally care for that limb until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Say Albucasis: or, friends, of this kind of cautery we have little experience, for its terrifying effect on the patients, and because few have found those that comfort them with it.</end_of_turn>
May these best cautery needles be applied to them who suffer, and find relief in that place for them.</end_of_turn>
May these cautery needles be more effective than medicines which endure, for you shall make two circles having an opening pierced in which the heel of the door will lie; let the length of the piece be two nuts or as many as those.</end_of_turn
And if the space which is between each two quantities of the thickness of the toe; and let it be opened from above and below, and let them contain each other according to this manner:
And thus pause over the ankle joint the patient sitting on their side, and compress your hand over the ankle joint; and let you take warm water and pour it between two circles, and let the temperature of that be somewhat like that of the small fire, and keep that for the quantity of an hour, and let the patient suffer the bite and the pressure of the ankle — for that other bite is like that of fire — until the bite ceases.</end_of_turn
And thus lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away the warm water from all around the ankle with cool water.</end_of_turn
And thus leave it for three days and pause over that border until the black of the pressure has gone away, and leave it for several days, and go from it when it has subsided; this is for the good.</end_of_turn>
And finally care for that limb until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if the pain is extended to the thigh or the hip, let them be placed in a position in which they can contain water as is done for the ankle swelling.</end_of_turn
This is the manner of warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.</end_of_turn Recipe for alkali and caustic not extinct of both parts, take one part each, and grind them and pause in a new broth from which the part left is perforated with a small hole according to the quantity that enters it.</end_of_turn
And pause for a while the broth of the other broth another broth heated, and get over that alkali and caustic alive with warm water which will take those up for a thumb, and when you have grasped those with the thumb for a good compression, and read what comes out of the acute water in the left part to the heated broth.</end_of_turn
And thus adjust all that water, and get the other caustic alive and another alkali renewed, for that hour if it is not strong acidity is administered in surgical operations of medicine and in cauterization of the other members, for that operation is like fire.</end_of_turn
And thus of some medicines which are cauterized widely, some are like vinegar and mal anacrat and caustic with salt that are mixed together.</end_of_turn
And thus relates a a man of the ancients the operation and care by which pain of ankle and sciatica is cured, and magnifies more than enough to be of that, and says that no other care is necessary, and that it is healed for a period of a week just as recommended, for that force remained in the bath and indeed it has already escaped from that.</end_of_turn
And that is to take certain herbs green, and if it is not found green, take recent fig; and take neither of these ground with a little gray and place it on the ankle in which the pain is, or in the thigh or the hip, and bind it.</end_of_turn
And let it be left for the quantity of three hours or for the quantity that the patient can endure of the pressure.</end>
And thus put that in bath and thus when the limb is swollen, take that out into the sun, for the pain ceases and it is healed.</end_of_turn
And you must know that no other remedy is used with these medicines but to evacuate the limb.</end_of_turn

From the cautery of pain of two.
Some diseases cause pain in the two limbs, such as in the case of worms or by percussion or by excessive evacuation, and for such causes, as well as for infusion of fiery and humid matter.
And the cautery does not suffice but in this single kind which is useful for the emission of fiery matter
Therefore cover, and evacuate the bad air with pills that are fitted and similar to it, that they be useful over the two in which the pain is three lines according to their latitude, because it is better not to touch any line or to cauterize or to burn more than is necessary, according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance and the power of it.
And let the cautery be useful with the cautery of points.

From the beginning of the swelling of the joints.
The mothers often suffer from this disease in the little children; and a sign of the beginning of it in the children is that it happens to them that the tendons are affected in the heel and that the elevation and the movement are hindered
And they also happen in the back of the two bones of the foot that already begin to overpower the other bones
And therefore when you often see that and you wish to prohibit it, then cauterize that which is circular in this manner that it surrounds the cautery over the whole part of the bone equally
And if you wish, cauterize on the circumference of the bone with two-line or three-line points And let the points be close to each other
And take care of the area until it is healthy with the water that we have said
Take care that the cautery is not administered in swelling that is useful for the spasm of nerves

Of the cautery of gout and of joint pain
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors
And therefore when the gout is cured due to the cold with the manner of treatment and the pains do not remain, then the cautery is left over.
And that you cauterize that which is close to the evacuation in the circumference of the foot bone with more cautery
And let the cautery be like olive oil of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery And if the pains rise into the nails or into the other joints, and that when the matter goes away, then cauterize that over every painful area with three cautery or with four from all sides with this olive oil cautery
And if more cautery is needed than these, then leave a little distance from your hand from the cautery before and after the specification of the wound
And if the pains arise within the nail and the heel, then administer the cautery that we have said in the preceding chapter.
If the pain is only in the toes and is severe, puncture in the circle of bones just as if it were a wheel, puncture in those two lines.
If the pain remains in the toes, puncture in the circle of bones around each bone and on the side of the thumb
If the pain comes close to the joints or muscles, then cauterize the whole area of the joints
Do not evacuate the patient urgently, but receive medical advice, for if it is well-regulated and the inflammation has subsided, evacuate it with this pointed cautery, God help us.

On cauterization of fractures.
When a fracture has occurred in the ankle bones and saying the bones are loose from the heel to the knee, and when it begins to approach, order the patient to lie still in bed and use soft pillows so that the wound does not open from the belly of the knee
And immediately follow the patient between your thighs on both sides, and order them to keep their thighs inside until the bone is fractured or the heel or the bone is seen to be loose.
And immediately return the one who is saying that to the thighs and bind the fracture on the bone of the little toe with a sign of the limb which appears like the thumb of a circle among the parts of the body.
And immediately apply the cautery in this way:
Until it is neither red nor blue Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And immediately stop the cautery on that sign with your hand on the cautery, and when you have seen that the little toe bone has entered the middle of the pulp; repeat this procedure until you have managed to bring it about in the first attempt on the bone
And pay attention wisely in the time of your cautery, that you do not burn that intestine so that on the patient there does not come death or any great evil
And remember that when you are doing the cautery do not neglect the bones, do not trust your operation
And cover the cautery of the children with caution according to their age and measure
And take care of the place of the cautery for three days with borders so that the burn of the fire is not repeated
And take care of the other parts that are inflamed until they are healed.
And the patient be kept still on the thighs for forty days until the wound and the swelling are sealed
And cover that you suspend the food of the patient according to the length of time of the treatment of them which will soften the belly of them, and that the intestine does not come out due to the effort to heal
And when it is time to take it away after forty days, give him nourishing food, and keep him for another forty days.
And be mindful of work and replacement of food and drink, and of speaking harshly, for when you use this regimen of healing the whole patient will be cured.
And I say the care of fractures in other parts of the belly, and so at the beginning, and do not neglect, when you cauterize the fracture of that with this cautery round according to its quantity; and what is extruded from the bone just as the third part of it; and take care of that which we have said, and do not adjust it.
And I have already said that the first fracture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this way, because it is a sign with a sign.
and is stopped in line that is equal to the width at the breadth of the fracture, and another line to the heel; and place your hand with a claw cautery, more the first cautery is more curious and good

Of cauterization of torsions
When pain persists for a long time in several limbs due to an accident or percussion, and it does not subside with usual remedies or medications, it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed instrument.
The cautery of all members according to their size, their toughness and flexibility, their twisting and their pain
Therefore, if the first cautery is not sufficient, repeat it several times; for it is commonly known that these pains are caused by the puncture of some member towards that member towards which it approaches, in order that when you cauterize them, the disease will be cured

Of the cautery of leprosy.</start_of_turn>
Several books speak of cautery for great joy, but management is necessary because of the species of leprosy that is useful for the putrefaction of fat and melancholy.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when you want to cauterize, consider whether the leprosy is spreading or has already healed in what has been said in the division, neither of which should be, and fear that the corruption will embrace all the limbs of the body and its entirety. Therefore, cauterize on the head with two cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and one at the back of the head, on the forehead above the eyebrows; and two on the cheeks; and one on the back, on the nape of the neck or on the shoulder.</start_of_turn
And finally, lay your hand over the cautery a a little distance from the bone, so that the scales fall off from the bone; and cauterize the mass according to need.</start_of_turn
If the leprosy has already spread over the body and appears evident, it is necessary that you cauterize in addition to the previous cauteries mentioned in the head; and two cauteries on the bridge of the nose, two on the two upper teeth, two on two vertebrae of the neck, five on the vertebrae of the chest, one on the breastbone, two on the ankles, two on the calves, two on the thighs, two on the buttocks, two on each armpit, two on each elbow, two on the wrists, and two on each finger and toe; and cauterize on all the joints of the hands and feet, and on each nail of the hands and feet, and on the hair of the body.</start_of_turn
And take care that you do not burn the nerves that are on the heel so that you do not damage them.</start_of_turn
Several books cauterize with one cautery on the fifth toe and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the heel.</start_of_turn
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more joyful and effective it will be; and know that the patient does not feel pain during the cautery, as has been said before, so that the body is already stupefied.</start_of_turn
And know that the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints according to what is preceded by the species of instruments.</start_of_turn
And take care of the cautery with flour of barley, honey and the other care that is necessary until it is healed.</start_of_turn

And make the cautery penetrate slightly through the thickness of the skin.</start_of_turn And take care of that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And several books speak of cauterizing every stiffness that arises in the hands and feet, in the vertebrae of the chest and see the recovery of the nerves that are tormented by that limb, and that the stiffness is relieved.</start_of_turn

When some medicines are delayed in maturation, and this is because of excess of humors, or for the state of the patient, who is old, decrepit, or weak, or for the time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the medicines; then cauterize in the circle of the veins a few small points; and so let it rest until it matures.</end_of_turn>

Corrosion is a mobile corruption in the limb, which consumes that which is like fire consuming dry wood.</end_of_turn
Therefore if sometimes that corrosion is in the place where you suffer the cautery with fire, then you must cauterize the nails a few at a time, as is convenient in that place where it is corroding.</end_of_turn
And so cauterize that of all parts until you have eradicated all the corruption and there remains no cause of it.</end_of_turn
And so let it rest for three days, and suspend over the cauterized places until three days have passed since you have applied olive oil mixed with sulfur over them until the sores have all vanished and all the corruption has gone.</end_of_turn
And so treat that which is like a wound that remains from the infection.
May it not be that three days have passed three times that the carbuncle has disappeared without corruption; for if not, the more so, since you must repeat the cautery over that which remains corrupt.</end_of_turn
Corrosion is medicine for many things in acute medicine, which is half in the place of cautery.</end_of_turn However, fire cautery is of greater use for this purpose.</end_of_turn>

Many veins in the lower part of the foot are affected by the left-foot disease called claw, which is a great cause of suffering, which makes the foot lame; and the cautery is done in two ways, one with fire and the other with cold water.</end_of_turn
The fire must be kindled in such a way that it appears like punishment, for it is done with iron according to the quantity which it contains of the key of all parts, and of subtle stripes.
And when you have kindled the fire, place your hand over the key and rotate your hand over the area of the key until the cautery reaches the depth of the key.</end_of_turn> And keep it like that for three days until it starts to swell.</end_of_turn> And then apply some warm compresses soaked in salt, and keep the compress on the area for one night, so that the inflammation will be eradicated from its roots.</end_of_turn
And care for the wound as if generating new flesh until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if it does not heal, and black spots appear on the surface of the body, mainly on the legs and feet, it is necessary that you administer in those cauteries with water, that is, take a handful of herbs or iron or punishment, and place that on the key; then withdraw a little of the water slowly, and hold your hand, rotating that with the compress of your hand from all sides, and press the edge of the tube against the root of the key, and return the water slowly from the root of the tube; and wait for the patient a little while for the biting of the water to pass for an hour, and then remove it, for the key will have recovered its roots.</end_of_turn>

When there is a tremor due to cold in the nerves or from excessive heat, or from another cause similar, it is necessary that you cauterize in such a way as to make four cauteries or five over the vertebrae of the two, between each vertebra a single cautery; and on the feet of the patient, and over the stomach of the patient, olive oil.</end_of_turn

Treatise on the Cauterization of Accidental Burns to the Body.</end_of_turn
When there are burns on the body, and there are pus-filled wounds that are caused by corrupt thick matter; therefore, at the beginning when it appears, it is necessary to cauterize over the whole head of the fistula with a fine needle or a piece of burnt mirt, extending the extremity to the fire; or at the root of the fistula longua; or with a slow cautery.</end_of_turn
And sometimes it is necessary to cauterize somewhat at the beginning of its evacuation in this manner; and do not be afraid, for the swelling will be broken and the pus will be discharged by those means, and the patient will be cured of them.</end_of_turn

Treatise on the Cauterization of the Sinus of Sanctum Affected by Incision of the Artery.</end_of_turn
There are many veins that must be cauterized that are incisions of the plaque which must be evacuated, or of the incision of apostemas or cauterization of the limb, and in this case it is difficult to stop that.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when it occurs, cover your hand over the orifice of the artery and pause over that the thread that you call the end of the suture, and hold it until all the pus from the sinus has drained from the wound, and that it does not remain.</end_of_turn
And then pause for a while in the fire the olive oil cauteries a few and many, by number a lot, and dry them over those until they are no longer ignited.</end_of_turn
And then take from those a little or a lot according to the wound and the plague in which the artery is broken, over that vein quickly push that the thread that you call the end of the suture, and hold it until it is withdrawn and the wound is closed.</end_of_turn
And when the sinus has been expelled from the orifice of the artery when you withdraw the thread that you call the end of the suture and squeeze the cauteries, then take another cautery cautiously among the previous ones that are in the fire, and do not cease until the sinus is retracted.</end_of_turn
Beware that you do not burn the nerves that are here, and that you depart from the patient with other malice.
Beware that when arteries flow freely, it is impossible to restrict them, especially when the artery is large, unless one of four methods is used: or you cauterize as we have said, or you extract it when it is not extracted, because when it is extracted the limbs become burned and the circulation is restricted, or that it be ligated firmly or tied with a strong suture to keep the structure firm, or that you apply some medicines that can restrict the circulation; and that you strengthen the area with powder or packing downwards.</end_of_turn>
May he who gives downward restriction of the limb with tight ligation and stricture of the drape or position of causes that burn and irritate, not cause pain but rather tartness.</end_of_turn>
May he who is at hand without a doctor or medicine, understand that the hour shows the operation of that vein as we have said, and learn to great constriction of the cavity that the circulation should be at the furthest limit of the sovereign part of the plague, and that the artery should not be remaugut; and that the artery should be moistened with cold water until the circulation is restored and thickened; and may he take care that there must be cautery or medicine necessary.</end_of_turn
Of incision and perforation and winds and of phlebotomy and of plagues and of their appearances.</start_of_turn
We have already said in the first chapter that in all disease in which cautery is convenient and medicine is comburent, and the occasions and causes of it, and the instruments necessary for it, and the forms of cautery; and we order the chapters of the sovereign part of the head to the feet.</start_of_turn
And I will proceed in this chapter in that way, so that what is desired may be alleviated, the hour about what has been demanded.</start_of_turn
And behold, since I begin this, cover your ears, because in this chapter it is for fear of what is in the first chapter of cautery.</start_of_turn
And for this reason you must be very cautious, because in the operation that is in this chapter many veins are seen to evacuate, which is for the life of the limb to which this disease is subject. The evacuation of this is by the biting of the vein with the cautery, or by incision over the swelling or by excision of the tumor or by the evacuation of pus or by the extraction of a sliver or by the incision of a stone.</start_of_turn And all these things are accompanied by fear and tremor and in most of them death.</start_of_turn
And I warn you that on you does not fall anything in which you are in doubt, because certain women have learned to manage themselves with the diseases of men.</start_of_turn And among them is some who will go away with their disease and will be lighter because of it, and will help the violence of what they find in their disease, and for the length of the disease, and for the fear of death which is in it.</start_of_turn
And these are the ones who give you fear and say that you will be cured, hoping for that health, and the severity of the disease is pernicious.</start_of_turn
Therefore do not consent to anyone who tells you of this manner; and your caution should be greater than your desire, and your eagerness; and do not presume any cause except for a certain knowledge that will benefit you, and to which you can hope for a successful outcome.</start_of_turn
And use in the care of all these diseases the prognosis and indication of the one to which health is converted, because in that is to you the helper in acquiring fame and memory, of the savior and the glory.</start_of_turn
Oh, children, God is with you and will not leave you direction and protection, because he is in your hand.</start_of_turn
And I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by chapters according to the order of the chapter of cautery, from the care of the head to the feet, so that it may be to you a relief of what you demand of it and what you need.</start_of_turn
First Chapter.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of water that is contained in the head of children.</start_of_turn
You know that this disease does not leave the children until they grow up and when the nurse gives birth to the head of the child, life is taken from them.</start_of_turn
Every vein that swells up for an unknown cause is obscure.
I have never seen this disease except in childhood; and of all those whom I have seen, it has always been accompanied by death. For this reason, I leave this work undone in these people.</end_of_turn>
I have seen that in a child, whose head was filled with water, the head swelled up so much that the caesarean section could not be performed because of its size, and that the humidity increased until death.</end_of_turn>
The humidity is either added between the cartilage and the bone, or is added outside the bone over the cavity.</end_of_turn
When the humidity is between the cartilage and the bone and the dressing is sparse, then you must make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure two finger-widths long, so that the humidity can escape.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if the humidity is greatly increased and the dressing is thick, two incisions must be made according to this manner.</end_of_turn
If the humidity is outside the bone, this is an indication that the head has been bled from all sides and the water is squeezed out when you press on it with your thumb against the cavity, and this is not due to the unknown cause.</end_of_turn> Therefore, three incisions must be made in the middle of the head according to this manner.</end_of_turn
Then extract all the humidity from the incision. Then strengthen the incisions with strips and gauze. Then give it wine and oil to drink for five days. Then remove the ligatures and care for the wound with salves and compresses. Strengthen the head by keeping it equal. Feed the patient with dry food with little humidity until the limb is comfortable and healed.</end_of_turn
Another method of incision is to consider the magnitude of the swelling and the collection of water, as some veins are more swollen in the occipital region, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; therefore attend to the incision where the swelling and collection of water appear, and drain the water as much as possible.</end_of_turn
Note that you must not incision the artery, and even though blood flows freely from safety, keep the patient calm and still for that flow of blood with the evacuation of humidity.</end_of_turn
End of Document.</end_of_turn
When swelling occurs on the calves or thighs due to humors, and this is an old condition, and you do not have confidence in the efficacy of medicines, the best cure in this case is the incision of these two arteries.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you want to make the incision, let the patient raise their head as high as possible, and grasp the limb tightly with the palm of your hand so that the arteries are exposed, and strengthen the patient's pulse by applying pressure on the area; and consider where the vein is located. As for the places where some of these veins are located under the skin, they are hidden so deep that they are only visible in old people.</end_of_turn
And concerning the other veins, try to touch them with care, and make an incision in any part where there is a sharp point at the incision reaching the bone, and do so for the width of the head.</end_of_turn
Or, if you wish, remove the swelling from outside the artery and drain it through the incisions at the edges of the wound.</end_of_turn
The length of the incision should be two fingers' width, for when any vein is cut, the blood flows out with a pulsating stream, which escapes frequently.</end_of_turn
If the artery does not appear on inspection, then measure the circumference of the ankle three fingers' width from above, and try again, and do so until you reach the bone.</end_of_turn
And the amount of blood that comes out is equivalent to one cup.</end_of_turn Therefore, do not take more or less of it, but do so according to the amount that appears from the virulence of the disease and the refilling of the artery.</end_of_turn
Consider the wound, and if there is any remaining cause of the swelling over the bone, then make an incision to prevent further swelling.</end_of_turn
And now stretch the wound with blunt instruments and with limed or silken threads, and care for that which is infected until it is healed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
From the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When old wounds or ulcers arise from agricultural humidity or from the quality of the lacerations of the temples, or even when old ulcers seem similar to these, and when these cannot be cured by medical methods, then we must resort to the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or to cauterization of these in the same way as we have shown
And the manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient lies on the side for which they are in the temples; and understand that the visible artery in the temple that is shown by the thumb is the one that we must cauterize, since it is hidden in few people because of its coldness
And if it is hidden, then strengthen the hand of the patient with some support; and cool the area with a rough sponge or evaporate the area with cold water until the visible artery appears And thus you take the oath of which this is the form: And now stretch the wound with blunt instruments and with limed or silken threads, and care for that which is infected until it is healed.
May be if the artery is small, then wrap that around the edge of the nail, and then cut a part of that according to the quantity for which the edges of the hand have become elongated and contracted, and do not break the flow of blood, because if they are not cut they will not heal the blood
And now evacuate the blood from the wound one cubic inch.</start_of_turn> Within three.
And if the artery is large, then cover that so that you lie that on two places with firm double folds of lint or with strong threads, and do not close it up until the decay has passed and the wound has consolidated.
And finally, we will make an incision between two ligaments; and do this at that moment or another time.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, cauterize that which is cut off within the bone which is cut off to the nail until the edges of the hand have become elongated, and leave in place of that the work that we have done.</start_of_turn>
And it is better work if the patient has a fever or has complete inflammation; for the cutting is of those causes that help to dry up the humors, and therefore it is better in judgment.</start_of_turn>
And cover properly the extraction of the arteries that you notice in the ankle, and keep them covered with fine dust, and treat with dry medications that will cause the flesh to swell and become soft until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if while working another wound should bleed blood from the artery, then you must cover that to restrict that blood, or to cut it off, or to fill the ankle with something, and strengthen your hand until the blood has stopped bleeding.</start_of_turn And if none of these causes are present, then wait a little while until the blood has congealed, and then moisten the area with cold water of violent cold until the pain subsides, and strengthen as you please.</start_of_turn
And what is more curious in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein at this cut, having two clips, since you have marked the two places at the attempt, and you leave out whatever you can, without setting alight, until you reach the bone and cut through the vein at two places, so that it is elongated between the edges of the hand, which are not consolidated at all by this cut.</start_of_turn
This is the manner of the cut:</start_of_turn
And the acute of the two clips is equal.</start_of_turn However, if there is less acute than two clips it is better, for if there is too great an acute close to each other, the flesh will be scorched too quickly.</start_of_turn
Therefore when there is any thickness, keep the fire of the flame on those and the flesh will be scaldingly torn away readily.</start_of_turn
This work is better than all other works and more pleasant.

Chapter four
On the care of body ailments caused by sharp and acidic humors in the joints
When the humors are acidic, and the cause of this is the veins that are over the head of the femur, do not interfere with any medical treatment, for sometimes the face of the patient already swells up and sits in front of the walk like a walk of ants, and the joints of that limb are swollen, humored more than before, that is to say that they are known to have been hurt before, and the nails are scratched by the sharpness of the tears, which is an old custom in the treatment of these things, and now that treatment is finished.
And command the patient to scrape the nails against the ones that are in front, and immediately make three incisions in the front equally distant according to the length of the face. And if the length of the incision is two fingers: one incision is equally distant to the length of the nose in the middle of the face, and the second according to the length of the tear ducts that are in the lacrimal, and the third from the other side
And take care that you do not cut the arteries that are in two layers, and extend your hand from the continuation of both mandibles And if the space of any incision is equal to the thickness of three fingers adjusted
And if you have a sponge pad or dry cloth with which you will cover it.
And between them insert the pad of two sharp extremities, of which this is the shape of the incision for them: That is from the temple to the second incision Extract from between two incisions over the bone, and place your hand over the area that is over the bone that is about the incision to move inside the second incision And immediately after take away this pad and insert into the first incision another instrument that is called cautery, blunt from one side and sharp from the other side
And stop the bleeding from that sharp side towards the flesh of the tendon towards the bone, and grasp that part that comes down to the incision, and fill up that until it reaches the inner part, and ligate all the blood vessels that go down from the head to the joints
May be continued the incision until the tendon is reached, and immediately make that in the inner part of the incision within the other incision
And when the bleeding stops, press the area of the patient's foot with a bandage
And immediately stop in any soft wound of old age, and place over those dusts covered in vinegar and oil and vinegar again, and whatever does not stick to the cautery burn.
And on the third day remove the ligament and administer great effusion of lukewarm or cold water, and take care of it with ointment of beeswax with oil of rosemary and other things that will make the wound heal
Chapter five
On the care of tears for cats and dogs that descend from the parts that are behind the head
When there is some acute catarrh and the continuous flow of tears, and sometimes the joints of the patient extend slightly, and it is already known to them, the ulceration of the eyelids and their rubbing against the nails, and in front of the head there is acute pain of the teeth and subsequent sneezing, which is the cause of these accidents that the matter and the catarrh do not flow but from the veins of the parts that come from behind
And the best treatment for these is this: that you command the patient to scrape the nails against the front, and immediately make an incision in the middle of the face, a little for the width (and start from the left temporal bone to the right temporal bone; and the incision is from the outside of the bone; and extend your hand from the teeth that are maimed by chewing), until the bone is exposed
Extract all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth and immediately replace between the two lips of the incision with old cloth or gauze And immediately remove any dust covered in vinegar and oil to prevent the cautery from sticking
When you see that the swelling has diminished and the pain begins in the nails of the fingers and toes, then you must treat that which causes swelling, as if you were taking two parts flour and four parts colophony and mixing them together, and of these make a plaster and apply it to the swelling that has occurred.

Every cause that exists in the ankles is one of four kinds, either a mineral stone or something resembling a stone, like iron or lead, or one of vegetable origin like rue or bean, or one that is variable like water and vinegar or similar things.
And therefore, when a stone is in the ankle or another cause resembling those that do not adjust or grow in the ankle, and the ankle is pressed to the sun, and sometimes the stone, when it is distilled out in any of those causes of olive oil or vinegar, then administer the extraction of it, and make it vomit, and apply pressure to the area where the vomiting occurred And therefore, when the ankle is pressed to the sun, some pieces of wax or lint are left behind, and the ankle is stretched to the roots of the hair, because the things that are causing this swelling are often soft and fatty in these causes
And if it is not softened, then administer the extraction of it with an instrument called epicicarios subtil, which is like this:
And if it is softened by the hand, it is good; otherwise, administer the extraction of it with a little sponge.
And therefore, if it is not softened by water, then make a needle of gut and insert the extremity of the needle into the hole of the ankle and close around the needle with wax and olive oil so that nothing is injured except the needle itself And then extract from the belly with great attraction, because these things are soft like water that we have mentioned before
Even if it is not softened in this way, then take a lukewarm bath or a cold compress that appears with a swelling in the heel, and take as many eggs as you can hold in your hand and put them on the edge of the wound, and cover that area appropriately with a bandage. And then insert that into the hole of the ankle easily, and then dry the ankle of moisture.
And therefore, if it is not softened by all the causes that we have mentioned, then you should consider that the swelling is due to a cold burn or spasm.
And the way to treat that is to touch the painful area of the vein of the ankle and extract from the root according to the virtue of the things, and then make that disappear between your hands and convert the ankle to the roots, and make a small incision in the heel of the ankle where the black spots are, between the bones that are soft in that area And if the incision is of a lunar figure, enter it until it reaches the stone, and the stone being grasped, hold that back with the instruments that are appropriate; and then close the incision in that moment with speed, and cure that within that time that it is healthy
And if the cause of the swelling in the ankle is one of the fats that grow and infiltrate, then administer the cure and the extraction of it; but if you do not obey this order even then, the doctor will take a sponge from you in this way: And give that sponge to the fatty substance that is causing the swelling in the ankle.
And do not delay when you think that that is already moistened by the vapor of the ankle, and put that in large pieces, and extract from it with nails or with a sponge, or by incision as we have said, because the extraction is alleviated
But in the water in which it is introduced into the ankle, cover that the pain uses vomiting with condiment at the beginning, and fill the ankle with a little old cloth, and pour over that ankle in which the water is, and if by water it is softened, it is not good; otherwise, take three or four stones of the size of a barleycorn and put them on the foot of the patient, and make them crush in the fire a little, and the patient shall put one of those in the hole of his ankle and jump over the other foot on that side and beat with the other foot on the foot that is causing the ankle to swell Therefore do not stop until all the water has been drained out.
Therefore do not stop until all the water has been drained out. And when the water has been drained out, take paper or gauze to soak up any remaining liquid And put one extremity in the heel and extend the other extremity over the fire until the pain is gone
And put the other gauze there and do it as many times as necessary until all the water has been drained out, and then draw out that which is called the extractor of the stone.
More in the extraction of a beast that is inside that heel, if it is of small size, it is enough to press and hold it, but if it is of large size which causes pain at the same time, then administer the extraction with the hand and nails, and the cause of this is less severe than all the other causes that cause pain in the heel
More in the extraction of worms that are hatched in the heel, when you have cured that which we have said in the division and in the treatise of distillations, and do not neglect your care, then it is necessary to cover the heel with the sun
And therefore if any cause of the worms appears, then extract that which is in the hand or nail subtile, even if no cause appears, then take a needle and draw out the stone wide from which this is the shape of it. And insert the delicate extremity into the heel according to the quantity which suffers from the pain of the disease; and then press on that with your thumb, and do it with many compressions, until all the worms have been expelled
If you do not obey my advice, then I will punish you and close the circuit of the needle with wax just as we have said; then administer distillations which have already been mentioned in the care for the worms, and you will find them in the treatise of distillations.
And be your effusion with which you administer the medicinal oils in the heel with this instrument of which this is the shape: And make that of silver or gold, wide and straight, in which there is a small hole, and place your thumb there.
And therefore be like when you insert it into the cavity of the continent here where it is necessary And if you wish, take the tweezers and wrap it around the extremity well enough to hold it, and then pour oil into the cavity of the ailment, or juice of any herb, or water of these medicines in the needle – and that is in the heel – and then insert the tweezers again with the thumb holding the compression properly until the oil is expelled from the cavity of the ailment and the pain is relieved by the oil remaining in the heel
And that which is infused in the heel is already scorched with fire a little And keep that the cause from which you distill in the heel is not too hot, because the medicines for the heel do not suffer from it
Chapter VII.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of the oil of the heel.
Some girls and young women suffer from the bites of worms that are in the large intestines of men; and that which has already happened in some men, oil in the meat of the heel for pleasure or for nothing in particular; and this oil is useful in the preon of the groin of the heel which does not succeed in the time, and some in the distant parts
And that which happens in the preon of the heel, which does not succeed in the time, is in the greatest dispositions of difficult healing
And in that in which you succeed in the time, cover that the heel of the patient is exposed to the sun and rest in that And therefore if sometimes oil appears, open that which is like a sponge of the thumb of which this is the shape:
If the extremity is small in the width, of which one part is acute and the other is not; and the sponge is of two lion's feet so that it does not make a wound to the heel
And therefore if the oil is for a wound born in the heel or in the meat of the heel, then take that which is delicate and cut that with great ease until all the wound is gone
And if the oil is in the preon of the heel, then take tweezers of lion's feet and burn that which is a little, and then put that on the meat of the heel
Therefore, if you smell a population of humors in the water that the patient drinks, because of the gravity of the disease, encourage the expulsion of the disease with ease; and take care that you do not damage the nerves of the heel.
And if the swelling of the heel has increased in quantity, according to the extent of the disease which you have enveloped in the Egyptian unguent; do this for a few days until you are sure of the consolidation of the disease; or that you take some of the infection and mix it in oil and sprinkle it on it and use it; and if sometimes the heel has already hardened, then leave the infection out and exchange that which you have enveloped in wool for another which you will wrap around it until the caulking softens; and take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Perhaps if blood flows too much, immerse sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the heel, and use another remedy which restricts the flow of blood, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillation.</end_of_turn>

Jaundice is caused by the accumulation of bile on the nails of the toes, some are wet, others are dry.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must keep the hands and nails immersed in vinegar or oil, and remove the scales from their roots, and place your hand over the area to prevent them from coming out.</end_of_turn
If there is pain from the flow of blood, then cauterize those which are lanticularly small.</end_of_turn
The best cauterization is when the veins are small and the surrounding veins return when the cause of those veins has been removed; and when they are cauterized with fire, those veins are consumed and do not return.</end_of_turn

Treatment for large ulcers that appear on the eyelids of the toes.</end_of_turn
The nails grow on the eyelids of the toes due to some cause which is similar to a large wound in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is painful.</end_of_turn
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the lower eyelid and pus.</end_of_turn
Therefore, the operation in them is that you consider if the greatness is derived from them in the water that comes from the eyelid and is widespread; and the cause of it is slight.</end_of_turn
Therefore, open about that which is fissured for the width, and easily drain that from all parts until it escapes, and then suspend that which is oily and remove that.</end_of_turn
And if the figure is great, then adjust it with a suture; and take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if it is little, you will not do too much harm by leaving that which restores the liquid and nourishes it.</end>
And if the greatness is diminishing from the depths of the eyelid, you must remove the surface of the depths, then remove the eyelid and suspend the greatness with oil, except that you dig from the incision, and pull that from all parts, and if the eyelid is elongated from the incision, the water will not notice in any way.</end_of_turn
And at the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and take care of the area with water that nourishes until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

Therefore, sometimes those tears are seen running over the face all the time, and over the face while sleeping; and so you must moisten the edges of their eyelids, which already have inflammation, and the imminent appearance of purulent discharge is on the pupil; and when you press on the area with your thumb, pus comes out from those.</end_of_turn
Every manner of operation is in that which the patient suspends his head in the belly, and immediately suspends the blood vessels and makes them calm, and makes of them a circle according to the quantity which contains all the arteries throughout, and immediately suspends that over that and puts two fingers on his thighs which are said to be throughout so that there is added archnea in the middle of the circle, and immediately after that removes from the middle of that humidity which is incident to the fissure for its width, and the fissure is not to be greater than the fissure which is made in phlegmatique patients.
Moreover in the preparation that you will make the incision throughout until you reach the arteries, because in the meanwhile proceed with the archneal process by fissure according to the shape of white grease.</end_of_turn>
Therefore extract that which you have enveloped between the thighs which are said to be above and below and roll between the right and left hand until it is dispersed.</end_of_turn>
And keep that you do not press into the fissure so that the blood does not reach the brain and remove that.
If indeed you do not see the arteries at the commencement of the fissure, then adjust in the fissure a little to facilitate the process of the arteries; and immediately after that extract that which we have said; and immediately after that cover with cloths in water and vinegar and vinegar and place your hand over the area and open those which are dusty.</end_of_turn>

Methods of handling the patient.
When in the eyelids of the patients there are born by adjustment of the lashes, these naturally cause the patient to wink and make various methods of disease appear such as excessive tears and softening of the eyelashes and cloth, which is the cause of destruction of the eye that is called to touch the eye, and care if in four ways: or by cautery with fire; or by acute medicine as it is said above; or it is sufficient to touch with the finger; or by cannas as I will say.</end_of_turn
Therefore keep that you suspend the patient’s head in the belly; immediately convert the lower eyelid of the eye to your left hand, and if converted, do not do so; otherwise, insert the needle into that place where it is faithful to the part beyond the lashes of the eyelid, and make penetrate the needle into the faithful place without it, and that which is — from the margin of the eyelid in which they naturally rest — from the lashes, and pull the faithful to the parts beyond the eyelid with the eyelid, and convert that which is over the ray.</end_of_turn
And immediately remove from the lower eyelid beyond the lashes the greater and lesser tears; and immediately after that extract the faithful and stop leaving the eyelid dusty with small fragments of hair, and immediately after that cover over the eyelid with a bandage, and that which is thus will be like a feather of myrtle.</end_of_turn
Moreover keep that the figure be according to the quantity of elevation of the eyelid, because that which already differs in men is that which indicates that it must be incised from the great quantity of the eyelid according to the quantity for which the eyelid is softened.</end_of_turn
And immediately remove from the two lines that you have marked over the eye the greater and lesser tears. And if your fissure is like those naturally from the parts, thus as the greatness of the king.</end_of_turn
And immediately put on the sponge in one of the two angles of the incision, and immediately remove that entirely, and immediately adjust with the suture the two lips at the root or faithful of the silk, and dry it, and make adhere what is superabundant of the threads over two eyebrows with some causes which you desire, or do not cure.</end_of_turn
And immediately read the sutures of the threads within three or four days, and immediately care for that.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, lay open the wound again after the sutures have been made, and care for that which will dry and contract, because the eyelid is relieved from the swelling of the wound and the addition of it; more suture is better Thus I say to those of ancient times.</end_of_turn
Moreover in it be urgent concerning the patient, and is of good operation, and do not be afraid of it.</end_of_turn
And thus it is another method in measuring, that on the eyelid there appears a mark like a twig of myrtle, and accordingly raise the eyelid with three fingers segregated and gathered in this way.
Or if this is not possible, keep the fingers spread, and if the pupil is not dilated, take a needle which has a thread and pass that through the middle of the mark, and pass another thread beside the greater lacrimal, and the third thread beside the lesser lacrimal, and adjust between the teeth which we have named the two threads so that they are equal, and then raise your hand as high as the elevation equal, raise the entire eyelid above which the mark is made as we have recommended.</end_of_turn>
And thus adjust the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for that which is well.
Or if after this the wound should happen to split, you must close the incision or the fissure, and keep that part moist and comfortable.</end_of_turn>
And every treatise must end on the eyelid that has been seen to be sufficient for the treatment of this kind of wound; in this way you will use what we have said about the incision; but if there is need for suture, do so as little as possible.</end_of_turn>
The following sentences continue the medical treatise, providing instructions on how to treat eye injuries.</end_of_turn> And thus you should convert the eyelid and split the mark as I have recounted; and accordingly make two sutures or two fine needles of such length as is equal to the length of the eyelid and the width of the mark should be less than the width of the pupil.</end_of_turn And you have already opened at the extremities of each part where you have the threads.</end_of_turn
And thus add some slight swelling under what remains of the eyelid of the eye, and tighten the sutures of each part with great strength, and leave that for a few days, for the swelling of the wound will diminish and if it should happen to fall out, it will do so on its own.</end_of_turn
Or if it is delayed, the hour will break at the sutures, and accordingly care for the wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And thus when it is solidified, the eyelid is elevated and the pupils do not dilate.</end_of_turn>
And this is the way to make two sutures as we have said: And there should be the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.</end_of_turn
End of text.</end_of_turn>
Of elevation of the pupils in the eye with a needle when the pupil is hard.</end_of_turn
When they are not natural, hard and rough and the pupil is inflamed, the custom of the operation is that you take a fine needle and pass it through that thread of silk and bone, and that you adjust the extremities of it so that they do not move in any other way.</end_of_turn And the length of the threads be of the quantity of a palm.</end_of_turn
And thus take another fine needle and leave it short, and tie the extremities of that one if you wish.</end_of_turn
And thus keep the patient’s head downwards if necessary, and let the sun shine upon it so that your work may be known, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.</end_of_turn
And thus insert the needle at the root of the pupil which has required engineering, and make that penetrate into the eyelid quickly until you have extracted that which has been detached from the natural pupil.</end_of_turn
And thus draw the pupil out again and insert it into the limb, and keep the pupil there for one or two or three times and no more.</end_of_turn
And thus withdraw your hand from that which has been withdrawn with the limb with the natural pupil in the eyelid with the limb natural.</end_of_turn
Or if the limb is not withdrawn from the pupil, you will withdraw the limb from the parts beyond the thread which you have composed of that, until the limb is withdrawn from the pupil itself.</end_of_turn
And thus with the vision of the eye, for the hour you will grasp the thread and the needle, and groan somewhat and clench the eye, and leave them closed for two days or three, until the pupil adheres to the limb and becomes visible once more.</end_of_turn
Or if the pupil is more short than the natural ones, the hour you will adjust a longer pupil than the natural ones, and elevate it like that, or that you will leave it until it is almost equal to the space, and the hour you will elevate that.</end_of_turn
Capitol XIII.
Chapter XIII.
When the swelling appears on the eyelids, and the pupil is contracted either to the right or the left side, due to bad consolidation of pus or wound or cautery, it is called leporine. And this swelling is either natural or accidental, and it is useful for consolidating pus or wounds or cautery, or for preventing their worsening.
May the method of the operation in this case be that you make an incision for the consolidation and separate the edges of the wound, and keep them in that space where there is between them a piece of lead, and bind them together until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
And do not neglect the treatment of the causes which cause the swelling, restriction; for if you do, the swelling will return worse than before.
Use in these cases that soften them as much as possible, such as fennel, and soak them in the water in which they are cooked with salt and seed of rue, or vinegar, which is liquefied with some oil, and immerse in this the lead, and care for it with this.</start_of_turn>
And the treasure of your care is that you perform all this with great skill, so that it is consolidated in the manner that we began.</start_of_turn
And this operation that we have mentioned, is nothing other than the rectification of swelling that does not restore the shape of the limb as it was before.</start_of_turn
Chapter XIV.</start_of_turn
From the treatment of the swelling which is useful for the eyelids.</start_of_turn
This swelling which is useful for the eyelids is truly called vertadierament swelling; and it is either natural or accidental.</start_of_turn
The accidental one is useful for pus or for wound or for cautery or for other things of that kind.</start_of_turn
The way of performing the operation is that you take a needle in which you make a double loop, and you leave that in the flesh, and that you pass the loop from the left lacrimal gland into the right lacrimal gland, until the loop reaches the two extremities of the flesh.</start_of_turn
And then extend the flesh towards the outside with the needle and hold that with the needle, and pierce through with a sharp instrument.</start_of_turn And therefore if you restore the figure of the eyelid as it should be, good; but if not, take a thread and suspend that in the fissured figure, and with that convert the eyelid, and close the two incisions on the edge of the lower eyelid.</start_of_turn
And the two extremities of the two incisions make two angles of the incision, which have been useful until they meet, and be of their useful angle until when they meet, they make a useful figure of themselves.</start_of_turn
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.</start_of_turn
And keep the flesh suspended as much as the width of the lower eyelid, so that you do not damage the eyelid.</start_of_turn
And adjust the separated parts and sew those with the thread of silk; and care for those as we have said of the soothing medicines and of the ointments that must be used when it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the swelling comes from a wound or suture or cautery, the custom is to make an incision in a flat manner over the edge of the eyelid as it is said before.</start_of_turn And then separate the skin between two edges as we have said.</start_of_turn
In the sum of the terms of the treatment of swelling when it is natural or accidental, that runs in the operation, according to how it is prepared in the form of swelling, and that is in the form of various mixtures.</start_of_turn
And the skilled artisans always prepare some means by which it is possible for him to restore the figure to its natural shape, or in any other way, and that evil disease according to what is convenient for the operation and the instruments at their disposal.</start_of_turn

Of the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.</start_of_turn
When this adhesion occurs among several people in the neighborhood that the eyelid is more distant from the album of the eye, and that it is prohibited from the facility of movement and of its natural works, therefore you must remove the lower eyelid from the eye, and elevate it up, or extend it with the thumb.</start_of_turn

If you wish to perform an incision, then open the patient's belly and take a deep breath of the patient's breath, then draw up the acute spleen towards you in this fashion: If you wish to perform an incision, then open the patient's belly and take a deep breath of the patient's breath, then draw up the acute spleen towards you in this fashion: extend your thumb and index finger and grasp the spleen just below the tip of the thumb.</end_of_turn> And if sometimes that happens and is confused and is in that place, then draw out your hand from your mouth, make a sign of the cross with your thumb and index finger, and spit into the air. Then place your hand back into your mouth.</end_of_turn>
And repeat this procedure until the operation is finished, until all that remains is the flesh of the patient. But if the cautery should slip from your hand, know that you have seen enough, and stop the operation immediately. Take care of the wound at the beginning so that it heals properly.</end_of_turn
And repeat this procedure until the operation is finished.

Of the incision of certain wounds and of what comes from a wound that has been adjusted in the mouth.</end_of_turn
Some veins in the eyes of old people are born with roughened flesh, and are covered until they cover the pupil, or approach or stretch over the eyelids and tightly press the eyelids against the edges and are bound together like a bundle of straw.</end_of_turn
More than that, if the patient is in pain in the belly, let him hold his breath; and with one hand grasp the heel of the thumb and with the other grasp the heel of the little finger and draw them towards the epiglottis as far as possible, and grasp the part with a forceps or with a needle; and then prick the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished with the needle, and keep your hand away from the mouth so that you do not cut anything further.</end_of_turn
And let your incision be such as we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps as those which are collected together as described in this chapter.</end_of_turn
Therefore when the incision is finished and all that flesh is removed, then fill the mouth with coarse salt, or spit out the thick blood and remain like the physicians of corrosive medicines, and keep your hand over the wound until the bleeding has stopped.</end_of_turn
And if there remains any cause of pain and it is necessary to repeat the operation, know that you must renew the incision, and take care of the wound with the medicine that has already been mentioned in this kind of case.</end_of_turn

Therefore it is necessary at the beginning to consider if the patient's mouth is strong enough and if there is no other disease present besides the bile, then collect that bile.</end_of_turn
And you command the patient to hold his breath; and with one hand grasp the heel of the thumb and with the other grasp the heel of the little finger and draw them towards the epiglottis as far as possible.

And finally collect those veins with fine forceps, with caution, and remove the blood as soon as possible, until all the veins are finally closed and have returned to their normal position.</end_of_turn
And keep in mind that you must not touch the edges of the wound; and if during the operation you see the sun, and if you are slow in your operation do not prick anything except those veins.</end_of_turn
When you are finished, then you spit in the patient's mouth green or yellow bile so that the acidity corrodes what is left of the bile.</end_of_turn
May it be so that if it is not possible to collect all of that at that hour, then you place all that you can upon that which causes the pain, and read it for a few days until the pain ceases and that there is reassurance of aftercare.

Of the reduction of an hernia to the navel
When the hernia is cured by cautery or acute medicine, when it has been preceded by the narration and is not healed, do not be rash but make incisions about the aftercare of the maturation, and extract all the moisture that is in it until the bone is discovered
And therefore when the bone is discovered and sometimes in its corruption or blackness, then you cauterize it with this method:
And it is called coarse scab, and is done without fear, and the head is rounded in such a way as to be pierced with a needle or aliskalfat by puncture of the skin (as is the case in this following form).
And rest upon the corrupted part of the bone, and turn that between the thighs mentioned, and press your little hand gently until you know that that corruption is gone
And if there are any purulent veins, then restore the limb with desiccant and astringent causes
Therefore if the limb is consolidated and there is good flesh in it and it is ligated for forty days, and it is not renewed and is not apostematized and does not suffer any accident, then you know that it is healed
And if not, then you must reduce the fracture to the shape of the navel, and do it in this manner: if you discover the bone with acute pain or medicine, and when the bone is discovered, then you take three stripes according to this form:
The edge of the limb is triangular, and the head is first extended into the limb as sometimes happens with this limb.
And rest upon the bone, and that from the lacrimal; and extend your hand a little more, and turn your hand towards the wound until you have pierced all the bone, and that you feel the pain subside as if the air were coming out from it.
Therefore restore the limb with astringent and desiccant medicines as well as with these methods
Therefore when the flesh and limb are firm, the matter which was leaking from the parts returns to the navel, so that this is more about the pain.
Chapter XX
Of the reduction of the swelling of the limb
When the limb swells completely and does not happen at night or diminish, then you must loosen the pain and follow it, and keep fresh air in the neck by sacrificing and sucking; and rest upon the limb liniment which is made with beeswax, aloe, marigold, and ochre, and strengthen the bandage over the limb with wool powder
And the manner of the powder is that you take lion's mane cloth four times folded; and make from these cloths
And rest those one upon the other according to the quantity of which the limb has need And strengthen over those with strong and firm structure; and repeat the fresh air by sacrificing and sucking; and prevent the drafts and keep the limb straight day and night
May it be so that while the ligament is softened, then keep it straight
And prevent the ligament both day and night as we have said
And if sometimes the limb has already been reduced, good, and if not, then repeat the bandage with the powders and the structure and the fresh air until it is healed
Chapter XXI
Of the incision of the swelling of the outer tunic.
When there is disruption in the outer tunic, and it is eminent and the process is outside the eyelids like a barley grain, and is formed like a man, and you wish to make an incision, then the operation in it is like that which we have recommended, that you enter the needle at the root of the eyebrow in the part behind in the part forward, and then put the needle in the which is double of the lacrimal part, and make that penetrate and read the first needle according to its situation; and then make an incision in the limb of the double thread and bring with it the part of the eyebrow in the circuit of the needle, and strengthen that part.

Then care for the oil that comforts that which is within until the wound is healed.
And every herb gathered from all around within the circle of the wound near the wound, do so by perforating with the pointed spatula that comes from the prelate of the wound, and run off the fatty moisture, and lower the wound and put it inside.
And do so until it is healed
Chapter XXXII.
Of the care of gout
This disease which is called gout is nothing but a swelling which is adjusted in the oil resembling water descending and not that one.
More than the work of the craftsman in it is that you make the patient lie down on the painful area and stretch, and indeed take hold of his head with your hands more than those that you see the swelling depart from those parts and that you dry it and do not let it fall, and put a lamp on it, for the disease sees its causes just as it used to.</start_of_turn>
And if it does not fall down, you know that it is water.</start_of_turn
More than if it is not prepared the descent of the swelling with the oil that we have said, when the patient lies down on the painful area and you take hold of his foot with the spatula and burn at that above the nail a little of the tendon of the ligament in the crown (in the place where the vein comes out), until the swelling is expelled.</start_of_turn
Therefore when it is expelled, then you distill in the oil cold water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fennel and honey.</start_of_turn
And do so also with the other causes until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XXXII.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of the water descending from the oil.</start_of_turn
We have already said the species of the water in the division and what is convenient to perforate with serum declaring, when that according to the state of health.</start_of_turn
You must make the patient lie down on the painful area over a cushion and hold his heel firmly.</start_of_turn
And put your left hand over the ankle of the heel, if the oil is on the left; or with your right hand if the oil is on the right.</start_of_turn
And with your right hand take the thumb, if the oil is left; or with your left hand if the oil is right.</start_of_turn
And pause the extremity of the thumb from the crown for the thickness of the ray in the bowl of the oil from the part of the lacrimal gland, and put your hand over it.</start_of_turn
And penetrate into the bowl of the oil and sit that the thumb has already reached due to the weight.</start_of_turn
And make that the measure of the thumb to the prelate is equal to the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the black, that is the crown of the eye; that you see the pupil in that eye for the clarity of the cornea.</start_of_turn
And withdraw the thumb into the place where the oil is, and put another herb under it, and thus if the oil descends too much, the patient will see the pain vanish from over which the sight was so bad, and the thumb in the heel of the oil.</start_of_turn
And rest a little; therefore if the oil has descended, then withdraw that other herb until the thumb is expelled.</start_of_turn
Therefore when it is dry and does not descend, then you extract the thumb easily, and gently move your hand back and forth, and dissolve in the oil a little of clear salt of gem and in that wash the eye; and then put outside the eye the fat or stop or oil infused with oil and put on it oil.
And thus those things which are of our time stop over that which is crushed in the bowl of oil.</start_of_turn
And if you do not obey your thumb at the entrance of the eye for its hardness — for some of the men of whom the oil is hard does not move —, then you must take hold of the spatula which is called the assistant of this form.</start_of_turn
Therefore perforate at that very joint, and do not move your hand away from the wound, for if you do, you will cause swelling of the surrounding area.
And so remove the wound according to what has been said above.</end_of_turn>
And you must congratulate him on his work, whether he is prepared for the patient who lies down in pain on the stone floor of a dark room, and that he is forbidden from all movement.</end_of_turn>
And rest in the nature of the thing so that its nature is calmed, and do not move his heel either towards the fractured part or away from it at all.</end_of_turn
And let him be bound according to his disposition within the third day.</end_of_turn>
And so remove that from that dark room and expel the evil eye, and make some causes, and then return the bandage within seven days.</end_of_turn
And do not let anyone do anything in the hour of the cures or at least be close to the infusion.</end_of_turn Have in mind that your patients will ask you for water so that the water will please them greatly in respect.</end_of_turn
Moreover if by chance a wound occurs after the cautery, the hour covers that you remove the dressing after seven days, and correct that which remained after the wound.</end_of_turn
The hour frees you from the sight of them and rests on their face for the time being that they exist in the dark room.</end_of_turn>
And so go away from that room gradually and speak to them about their causes.</end_of_turn
And know that in no way is the disciple of vision excused for some herbs, and the hour you remain alert about the operation.</end_of_turn
And so it has come to pass that some of those who are with us have reported that in the Great Air of Ayrac there is a flame that is pierced by water.</end_of_turn
However, I have not seen anything like this on our land that has been perfect in water, or that has been permitted to any of the free men of the ancient times; and it is possible that it is new.</end_of_turn
These are the forms of magical substances for which it is necessary to know those who do not know them:
Whether they are made of lead or of iron in their own right, or if they are the extremities of their bodies in this triangular shape, the acute extremity is like that of the shape.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXV.</end_of_turn>
Of the care of wounds there is nothing new under the sun.</end_of_turn
When there are various wounds on the body, each of whose causes is like a scorpion's head or a many-headed serpent; this disease is called polypoüs which is like the representation of that head.</end_of_turn And it is a gangrenous wound, spreading, of brown color; and it is like a wound of a lion not of brown color.</end_of_turn
Therefore in that which is like a lion's wound neither fraudulent nor gangrenous, you must make the patient lie between your thighs and put him in the sun, and open the wound, and cauterize the surrounding tissue.</end_of_turn And so remove that from the other parts, and indeed cauterize that which you have comprehended of those with that sharp, subtle point of the one part until you know that the whole wound has already been cauterized; for if there remains any cause from which the abscess is possible, the hour you remove that which remains of those instruments which facilitate that until there is no longer any cause left.</end_of_turn However if the lord be merciful with the wound or if a wound occurs after the cautery, the hour you stop is sufficient; or if it is a malignant abscess, the hour you cover and cauterize until it is abscised and the cavities are restored.</end_of_turn
And so keep in the face the beginning of the wound a little vinegar and wine or vinegar. And although the wound has been opened and humidity has proceeded to the palate, the hour you know that it is already healed.</end_of_turn
And although humidity does not penetrate as it should, the hour you know that the wound is not like that on pus-filled bones of the nails to which it does not reach an abscess.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you enter with force into the belly of the person who is suffering, do not rush in blindly, but pause for a moment in order to ascertain the quantity of the dose or medicine that should be given, and when you have grasped the ailment, bring out a limb from the belly towards the navel or towards another part which is the cause of the disease.
And when that is done, if the evil humors have already left the channels of the limbs, and if they have gone up onto the surface of the foot, they cause the feet to swell like children who have been beaten at school. This is a light cause of this kind of disease.
Then pause both limbs, one which is going out towards the nose and the other which remains in the nose, and immediately administer ointment to the nails that are in the belly, and do this until you know that the nails are already on the nails of the belly
Then pull out the limb, and pause in the nose for a moment, then apply the plaster to the wound as a bandage, and do this for three days or more until the ulcer has healed completely
And finally, when the cause has passed, leave a lead cannula in the nose for several days until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
More importantly, if you are treating this, take care of it like this.
And this is the way in which the instrument called capitula is prepared, from which oils and medicines are distilled in the belly:
Make it of silver or lead, which is like a small lamp with a wick, as thick as a bean, and the meat should be similar.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like this, with a tube, and insert the cannula of the capitula instrument and make it flat, uncovered; to which you will attach that when you extract oil or whatever you want from the juices and causes of the disease.</start_of_turn
End of treatment.
The patient has now recovered from the disease in the limbs of the belly.</start_of_turn>
The feet swell up like children who have been beaten at school, and this is a light cause of this kind of disease.
And in order to prevent this, you must take action as soon as you notice the beginning of the disease, and do everything in your power to prevent it.</start_of_turn And pause for a moment over the area or cauterize or apply a burning medicine which is appropriate for the location of the disease.</start_of_turn
If the disease has been delayed, but is recognized as being serious, when it is soft, dark, of a yellowish color and without much sensation, do not touch that which is a tumor of the cranium; for the swelling of the feet is due to the great malice of this tumor upon that from which it proceeds.</start_of_turn
If the tumor is of a lion's color, touches it not; if it is of dark color, and the disease begins to appear in all parts, then evacuate the patient and apply this treatment, and take care of the area with oil and pressure until it is healed.</start_of_turn
End of treatment.</start_of_turn
Of suture of the nose and lips and ear when the continuity is dissolved by plague or by contact.</start_of_turn
Knowing that when continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little faith is placed in that operation except in the hands of an expert.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when you must deal with any cause of these, consider if it is fresh plague with the sick person, and if so, adjust the two lips of the plague with suture, and take care of that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the lips of continuity have already been separated, and some part is still healthy, you must remove some part of the apparent wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn And adjust the two lips with suture and strengthen them, and over them sprinkle holy oil and sprinkle salt, and place over the powder a piece of diaphanous plaster, or some other plaster of consolidation, and leave that bound for two days or three, and then remove that plaster and change it, and leave that until the wounds are healed.
Mays the manner of the suture is that you add the solution of continuity or with needles just as we have recommended in the suture of the belly, or you add the solution of continuity with thread just as before and make known.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</start_of_turn>
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</start_of_turn>
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</start_of_turn>
Mays the manner of the suture is that you add the solution of continuity or with needles just as we have recommended in the suture of the belly, or you add the solution of continuity with thread just as before and make known.</start_of_turn>
From the incision of the skin adjusted in the armpits.</start_of_turn>
Great is the bleeding that does not appear on the adjusted skin of the armpit, where it is necessary to suspend that until once or until you have the forceps and make an incision for the cause, and read the bleeding to stop or to make it desist.</start_of_turn>
And place above the area of bleeding a soaked cloth or other absorbent substances or excitotomy.</start_of_turn
And if the skin returns, then immediately cauterize that area, so that it does not return.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXIX.
Concerning the reason for teeth with iron.</start_of_turn
When on the surface of the teeth of the jaws and of the forehead and between the gums are adjusted rough scales, legs, and some bleeding appear of black color and are caused by corruption, and the gums see by that corruption of the teeth that are loose.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must take away the cause of the disease between your thighs and place the head of the patient on the belly, and scrape the teeth in which those scales appear to be like sand that remains from them, and what remains of the black spots and the citrine and other things that may be modified.</start_of_turn
Therefore if this is the last time that this is done, do not do it; but if so, then repeat the process three times every other day until the patient recovers.</start_of_turn
And remember that the teeth have needed various forms of support and various figures according to how it is prepared for your operation.</start_of_turn And so that the razor with which the tooth is shaved is different from the razor with which it is shaved between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of shaving must be prepared by you, which you will see in various ways.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXX.</start_of_turn>
Of tooth extraction.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must care for the tooth from its pain until its total eradication, because there is no cause that replaces the bleeding when it is eradicated, which is a sublimed substance except in the case of its extraction.</start_of_turn
Therefore when the disease is urgent that the tooth be extracted, you must certainly confirm that it is the painful tooth, because many bleeding cause the pain to disappear from the disease, and it is in a healthy tooth that the pain does not cease until the painful and diseased tooth is eradicated, as we have seen in the operation of the barbers.</start_of_turn
Therefore when you must confirm that it is the painful tooth, and that you know well, then cover the area around the tooth with cloth or with forceps, until the tooth is completely detached from the gum in all its parts, and then remove the tissue that is above or around it with small forceps or fine scissors little by little until it is softened.</start_of_turn
And immediately hold something strong in front of the patient's great pain for good speaking or stupor, and place the head of the patient between the painful teeth that you must not touch, and gently extract the tooth in the manner that does not cause more pain.</start_of_turn
Therefore if you forget it, take one of those instruments and put it aside from all parts easily and easily remove it as soon as possible.</start_of_turn
If the tooth is fractured or rotten, then cover the wound with a bandage and bind it firmly to the root with a thread that is strong in the area where the tooth is held.
And cover the wound meticulously with excision around the whole circumference of the gum, and do not weaken it so that you do not break it again, and return over the patient for the wickedness that is greater than the first pain you caused them
And know that you must not do anything that ignorant barbers often do in their fisting and daring in eradicating them, for they do not administer what we have recommended; for bruised women often bring great sicknesses upon men, which are more difficult to cure, and the causes of these remain hidden, or some of them, or that they extract that which has been proved useless in many cases.
And for the eradication of these things, let the mouth be washed with wine that is cold or wine with salt.
And if blood flows from the wound to help, just as bruised women often do, then take away any amount of vomit and sprinkle it over the wound, and if you do not see that vomit, cauterize.
The form of forceps and pliers that are suitable for gripping the tooth at the beginning is long handle and short handle, broad, so that they do not bend when working on them
And so sometimes with a broad handle, as when you first grasp them, they are not bent, but when you have grasped them for a long time, they are short handled
And these are the nails of India, descending, and those of the tweezers are extended, and in the extension of these there are teeth that enter one into the other and strengthen the descent firmly, and some of them extend the extension of these so that it looks like the beak of a heron, that is, so wide, and they are of great constriction
Capital. xxxi.
About the eradication of teeth and the extraction of the bones of the fractured mandibles
When the tooth is fractured and remains any cause, then cover the area around the wound at the border for a day or two until the area is softened; and at the same time apply an emollient or bandage to the extraction of which is assembled like the beak of a heron called ciconia or guinea, in the form of forceps:
The extractions of these are done with teeth like a file or knife
And if you do not obey these instructions with these forceps or pliers, then cover the reason and remove all the flesh and put the instrument that has no name, that is, a small lever whose form is this
And be of a short handle, a little one, and do not be afraid so that it is not fractured
Therefore if for this the reason is deeply embedded, do not; but if so, help me with other instruments of which these are the forms: the shape of the first instrument is triangular with a handle of any thickness
The shape of the second instrument is that it is triangular and of more subtle handle
And already with this instrument you have two slopes of which this is the form following: And with other instruments that precede in the shaving of teeth; for the help of this instrument which is assembled like a great wheel, and this is the form
Of the triangular handle that is thick or short, of any thickness, and do not be afraid so that it is not fractured.
And other things that must be known about the instruments of teeth are similar to the others.
And the skillful artists and subtle in the art, finds for themselves means according to what they understand of the operation and the various diseases; for these are the diseases for which the ancients did not say or even recommend any specific instrument, for the forms of various species.
And if the bone of the mandible or of the other bones of the mouth is fractured, or if you are afraid, then be careful over that in its place with the instruments and pliers that we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help me with the management of which this is the form:
And be of any size, small or large, and be tied or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or run away until the bone is completely healed; and then restore the area with appropriate medicines as soon as possible
If the pain is slight, reduce the [treatment] somewhat; for in this way the pain in the foot will be lessened. Care for that which is within that which is healthy.
If the pain is slight, reduce the treatment somewhat; for in this way the pain in the foot will be lessened. Care for that which is within that which is healthy.
About the care of prominent teeth over the others.
When teeth are prominent and do not conform to their natural shape, they are jagged and especially when they extend towards the women and the revered girls; therefore you must consider: if the tooth is not at all adjacent to another tooth, and it is not possible to extract or ligate it, then leave it alone; but if it is not annexed to another tooth, you must cut it off with this instrument whose form is like that of a shark's tooth and which is made of Indian steel of the highest quality.
And let your incision be at the place where you are cutting and that it is not like that of other teeth.
And if the prominent tooth is exposed to wear, then cut that with the Indian steel file whose form is like that of a file.
And it must be of Indian steel, the mark clearly evident; and of such a size that when you file with the file with which needles are used, the tooth is filed little by little in several days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or falls out. And when you are finished, line up the area again and remove the instruments of sawing.
And if there is a chipped piece of the tooth and you have licked the tongue, then you must cover that area until the biting edge of that piece is lost and equalized, and that it be filled so that the tongue does not bleed or the word does not corrupt

On the restoration of teeth marred with gold or silver.
When accidents occur to the teeth before concussion and loosening by percussion or extraction, and the patient does not suffer from that, and you have cured that with medicinal substances, and it has not been of any use, then in order that they do not fall out you must bind them with gold, not with silver, because silver turns green and soon becomes poor in a short time, while gold never changes.
And the gold must be of such fineness and grain as to enter between the teeth; and the shape of the restoration is that you grasp the gold and double it between two healthy teeth, and that you make it grow between two curves of the gold between two marred teeth, or if one or two, until the cloth reaches the sound tooth on the other side And finally, repeat the process inside the part from which you started, and strengthen your hand with ease and knowledge until it is not marred.
And let your incision be at the root of the teeth that you do not avoid
And when you have inserted the excess of the gold into the forceps or tweezers, add them to each area in the mouth, and convert them so that they are hidden between the sound tooth and the marred tooth, so that it does not cause injury to the tongue. And thus lay it so that it is firm like Rome.
But if it is loose or flexible, strengthen that or those with the other gold in such a way that they remain firm at all times.
And this is the way of the teeth and the figure of the restoration of two sound teeth and two marred teeth, as well as when these are linked:
And when you return a tooth or two back towards the place where they were lost, and they are reduced as we have recommended, and that they remain fixed.
Do not do anything but a good craftsman and a wise man.
And many are suitable for the cause of the bones of the cow, and it is useful for them as a form of tooth, and is placed in the place where the tooth is wanting, and is strengthened as we have said, and remains and serves for a long time

On the incision of the ligament that is in the tongue and prevents that which is spoken
This ligament that is left behind the tongue has some veins or is naturally such that people do not know it, or it is accidental and occurs due to an injury that has already consolidated
The operation in it is that you open the mouth of the patient, remove the existing scab in the gut; and elevate the tongue and in that place you make the incision of that nerve according to its width until the tongue is free from its recession.
May it be so that in such case there be any hardness or bony protrusion, and that it be for the consolidation of the plague, that you yield once and split that apart until you have incised the ligament and dissolved the nodulation.
And keep in mind that you must not make a cut in the sole of the foot and that you should split here the nerves and let blood flow of safety.</end_of_turn>
And immediately wash the remnants of the incision with either oil or vinegar or cold water; and then leave the tongue loose; for this is the cause which the patient has left the tongue in any night so that it is not solidified or softened again.</end_of_turn>
May it be so that blood should flow out, pause over the bruised area treated; may it be that the blood clot has gone, for in this case cauterize the area with a pointed cautery which you moisten with water.</end_of_turn> And immediately take care of the other causes so that it should be healed.</end_of_turn>

The extraction of wisdom teeth leaves the tongue.
Some doctors have observed that after these operations the tongue is left hanging like a small nail, hindering its natural operation; and this is greatly lamented until the mouth is emptied.</end_of_turn
And the operation in this case is that you make the patient sit facing the sun and consider the hanging nail.</end_of_turn
And if at times you see a yellow or black spot, rough, to which the patient does not feel pain, then do not touch that which is rotten.</end_of_turn
And if it is pale, in which there is moisture, then immediately put on the thumb, cut off that part that is soft, and cut off the whole thing; and if there is blood in the hour of your operation, then immediately stop the bleeding by pressing down on the wound, even if it is bruised, until the blood has clotted.</end>
And immediately return to your work until you have completed it, until it has been washed with vinegar and salt; and take care of the other care for the water until it is healed.</end_of_turn

The extraction of wisdom teeth from two angles and that which is nothing in the palate and of the other wisdom teeth.</end_of_turn>
When the wisdom teeth are embedded in the palate, these are salivary glands which are placed together in disorder, which cause them to deviate two wisdom teeth, which when you treat them with water as we have said in the division and it is not healed, then you must consider if the wisdom tooth is hard, yellow, or with little sensation, for in that case do not touch that which is rotten.</end_of_turn
And if it is of yellow pus and the root is large, do not touch that which is rotten for the blood; remove that which is decayed either by force or by means of an instrument, or if it is broken by itself.</end_of_turn
And if it is pale, soft, and the root is thin, then that which must be cut off.</end_of_turn
And the operation in this case is that you consider, before you begin your operation, if the wisdom tooth has already healed completely or if it has diminished in any way; and the hours you make the patient sit facing the sun, and the head of the patient is in the chest, and you open the mouth of the patient, and the servants take between their hands the tongue of the patient from the instrument without any noble instrument of which this is the form:
Either of silver or of gold, and be thin like a coat.</end_of_turn>
Therefore when you touch that with your thumb and you show it to me the wisdom tooth, and you place your hand on that which is in the meat, the hours take the thumb and stay there, and pull that which is outside as much as you can.</end_of_turn And another which you must pull out of the clothes, and immediately cut that with this instrument which is like this:
And another which you must pull out of the clothes, and immediately cut that with this instrument which is like this: And it is assembled like forceps, however the stems of these are curved, so that the orifice of each of these is at the bottom of the other, not sharp, which is of iron inside and outside.</end_of_turn
May it be so that if this instrument is not at your disposal, the hours cut that with this sponge which is like this: And it is sharp from one side, not sharp from the other side.</end_of_turn
And having cut one cavity, cut the other according to this manner, and immediately after the cut the patient should rinse with cold water.</end_of_turn
May the blood flow freely, preserve water of decoction of poppy seed or of myrrh flower and keep it similar to that of the causes stipulated until the blood flow is restricted, and then care for that which remains healthy.
Every vein now becomes swollen in the groin, others afterwards in those two heels, and incides those according as you wished and as I have said at the beginning of these matters
And I have already treated a a woman of apostemas who was born in the groin, who had a yellow apostemas, little feeling, which had already closed the groin of her, and the woman breathed with difficulty, and I had already prohibited her from eating and drinking water, and she was on the verge of death if more water had not been given for a day or two.
And the apostemas had already swollen so much that there were two ramps between which I had to make two incisions
Therefore I stitched fistulately and remained on one of them, and pulled out the other, and when I had taken out a great part of it, I incisioned that which did not comprehend the other side, and I opened the mouth of it, compressed its tongue, and remained on that side of the apostemas.
And I evacuated a great part of it, and did not bleed from it except for a little blood Therefore the groin of that woman is absolutely cured, and she began to drink water immediately, and I prescribed her no food, therefore I did not cease to make incisions of that apostemas for a long time, and afterwards there was another apostemas in place of that, which I incisioned as long as that one lasted
Therefore I went quickly and cauterized the groin of her, so as to prevent recurrence; and I went away and did not know until now that God had taken her from me.

From the beginning of this illness when it is apostemated.
When the swelling of the limb is upward and is apostemated and is long, the hour it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part wide and round, and the hour it is called buba
When it is cured with the things that we have said in the division, and you do not neglect your treatment, sometimes the apostemas disappears by itself when it has shrunk; in that case you must know that it must be sutured around, and if it is of that length, and is bloody, of a yellowish or blackish color, and is not firm, you must fear that there is danger of the disease.
And when you see that according to the manner that I have said of its whiteness and length, that the pain has disappeared and the tongue has become limp, which is an instrument with which it proceeds, and you leave the mark of the instrument on the new one, pull out that which is in the old one and incision that with one of the two instruments which are mentioned at the beginning of two mellas.
And you must know that you must not make the incision except as is adjusted to the natural term of its addiction, because if you make the incision too much, you will make it worse
And at the end of the incision, use the thing which we have recommended at the beginning of two mellas, and care for that which remains healthy
When the disease is feared by the incision, know that you must use force in the cauterization of it, and the way of making the incision is nothing but with acute water, that is to say, you must press the head of the patient down, and at the same time grasp the tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned, and then take some water which we have mentioned in the chapter of cauterization, and comfort that which is alive, and stop that which does not expand or contract, and from that fill the cavity of the instrument which is like this form.
Like the extraction of the cavity in which the medicine is stopped just like the cavity of the heel of a ray, and stop the instrument with the medicine over the lip, the pain will go away over the side of the teeth so that it will secrete saliva or mucus from the mouth of that thing for the intrinsic medicine, so that it does not remain from that any cause over the groin of it and that it escapes from there.
And then put your hand on the medicine and press that against the uvula for the space of a quarter of an hour until that which is being treated has been made pale and quiet by the bite of the medicine.
And if you wish, take a sponge and cover that over the limb of the ray, and immerse the sponge in the medicine, and put the ray on the sponge in a tube so that the sponge adheres to that tube, and do that for as long as it takes until you achieve what you wish from the cauterization of the heel, and then remove that which has dried up and fallen off by itself within three or four days.
If you suspect that the medicine is inadequate, repeat it, and apply the cautery again in the circumference of the navel towards the breastbone, and modify that which is in the circumference of the medicine, and let it be washed with cold water, and let it be cured with unguents, and leave it under guard until it is healed.
This kind of treatment is more safe than rash and takes less time.
Some herbs are cured with water which is more subtle than cautery and rash, which is cured by fumigation in this manner: prescribe calamine, broth, origanum, rue, bitter almonds, chamomile, barley and similar to those herbs, and adjust all these causes, or some of them, in a dose, and let them be immersed in strong wine, vinegar and broth; and the dose should be shaken well, and in the middle of the dose put a sponge, over which is placed an instrument of iron according to this manner; let it be made of silver or iron.</end_of_turn>
And let the extremity be introduced into the mouth of the patient until the vapor reaches the uvula above the tonsils, until the uvula is not obscured.</end_of_turn>
And repeat the treatment above until it is dry, and keep that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an attack of apoplexy, because it would be too strong for the apoplexy, and do not think you should perform it, but declare the apoplexy from it.</end_of_turn
If you do not have this instrument, then take a tube and put a pledget of wool in the extremity of it, so that the mouth of the patient is moistened, because the pledget of wool prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.</end_of_turn
This treatment is good for health.</end_of_turn>

Extraction of stones and that which adheres to the bladder and other causes.</start_of_turn
The stones adhere to the bladder or heel bone or any other cause.</start_of_turn
Then you must know that you must extract that which is apparent, on which you cast your sight, since you press the tongue with the instrument of the tongue, so that you may be told what is in the bladder.</start_of_turn
And that which is not apparent and is hidden in the bladder, you must think that you must vomit the patient while the food is digested in the stomach, because it strengthens the underlying cause of the bladder if it is forced out by vomiting; or that you swallow the patient a spoonful of broth or a piece of radish or a piece of bread dry; or that you give a spoonful of sponge marine soaked in oil, and bind it firmly with faith, and let the patient vomit that, because when it reaches the place where the stones are and are extracted, the patient will be freed of them.</start_of_turn And take an eel and bind it firmly with faith, and let it be drawn out; or take a horn and bind it tightly, and let the patient vomit it out.</start_of_turn
If these causes have not been freed, then take a plum instrument according to this form:
And let it be more thick than ray a little one, and in the extremity of it there should be a cavity in which you can insert the tip of your instrument into the bladder easily.</start_of_turn
And keep the patient's head elevated in his bed, and keep that you touch his sides from the belly, so that you do not damage his liver or the bone, or that the physician puts his hand on it.</start_of_turn
However, if the patient vomits more, because of his knowledge of the location of the underlying cause and because he can touch it in his belly, he should withdraw his hand from the instrument in his hand, as much as he is prepared to do so until it is freed.</start_of_turn
End of Document.</start_of_turn
Extraction of blood clots that are attached to the bladder.</start_of_turn
When blood clots are treated with the medicines that have been mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines and do not cause discomfort, consider the time of the patient's bladder in the sunlight, because you have compressed the patient's tongue with the instrument that you have recommended.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if sometimes the blood clots are small, extract them with small incisions properly.</start_of_turn
And if you cannot extract them, take a curved catheter and insert it into the patient's bladder, and place at the bottom of the catheter a burning iron, and do as many times (until the blood clots are dead and remain from the bladder) and abstain from giving the patient anything to drink for the whole day.</start_of_turn
And so, prepare a basin filled with cold water, open their mouth with that, and wash their mouth with that; and do not allow anything to pass from their mouth for an hour, and drink water an hour later with your hand, so that the blood sugar should be as much as when the water was poured.
However, if it is not advisable in the water that we have recommended, then submerge the patient's abdomen or abdomen with the instrument that we have recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do thus, so that the liquid will not fall out.
And another method of operation in the fumigation of that is that you take a sponge in which are burnt coals and cover the sponge with a coverlet of the kind that has a hole in the middle, and put the extremity of the instrument in that hole; then withdraw the fumigation; and place the patient's mouth over the end of the cannula and close their mouth so that the fumigation is not lost until you know that the fumigation has reached the bloodstream, because the bloodstream should fall out
And if it does not fall out, then repeat the fumigation many times; abstain the patient from drinking, and give them salt-laden foods and others, and do not drink water, and if necessary, do this for a long time.
And this is the form of the instrument from which the blood is drawn from the groin when it is seen; it is similar to forceps in this way as often as not, but it has some curvature: which is equal to the groin, and the extremity of it is like the beak of a heron, which is hooked, in which is grasped by five fingers, so that when they grasp any cause, that it does not slip away
The end.
In which is the sum of the sermon in the opening of apostemas and in the section of them.
The apostemas are many species, of many methods, according as you remember them, from some in this book
And they are various in perforation and section for two methods, of which one is for the species of apostemas in themselves; and for what they grasp of humidity.
And the second method is for the places in which the accidents of the body occur, for the apostemas that happen in the head are different from those that happen in the buttocks; and the apostemas that happen in the fleshy parts are different from those that happen in the joints; and each one of them must be treated differently for the operation
And indeed, some apostemas should not be perforated except at the proper maturity of the blood in those or in their complement
And other apostemas should be ligated when they are crossed, and are not mature according to their complement, as well as apostemas that are proper for the joints, for an apostema when it is near a joint, is prolonged until it has reached the liquid that is in the circuit of it, and when it is corrupted it corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, because it is a harmful cause of contraction of that limb; or it is an apostem of the main limb, and if you delay the perforation of it until it is mature it will not benefit the main limb; or it is proper for the buttocks, therefore perforate it only when it is not mature; and do not perforate it cruelly, except for the one that is proper for the buttocks, so that you do not cause a fistula, or that it is not healed in the end that it is not healthy Indeed, you must know the time of the perforation of the apostema, and that is when it is mature.
And you must know that it is mature when it is the cessation of pain and the cessation of fever, and almost the diminution of rigor and pulse, and the sharpness of the head of the apostema, and the other signs
And you must know that you must perforate in the place furthest from the apostema and where the cure comes from the prominence
The perforation must always be done through the length of the bone or the body, if the apostemas are in the parts of the head or the feet, and in the places of the lacerta, of the cords of the nerves, of the arteries; and finally, in all the places where there is reflection; for in those where there is reflection, use the perforation according to that limb.
When the apostema is in a fleshy part, then you must wait before perforating it until its digestion has been confirmed according to its complement, as we have said; for if you perforate it before that, it is prolonged the time of suffering and of great harm, and it makes the lips of the limb stiff and the depth of it
The wound must be punctured according to the width of the limb or the extent of the swelling, or as much as is necessary for the part which is suffering.
And thus administer a small puncture, in the large abscess great puncture and wide or several sections according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.</end_of_turn>
And thus are the abscesses in which you must make the cordena concave and inflamed, when it is necessary to prevent that it should burst, as it is in the case of boils and carbuncles.</end_of_turn
And of those which are incised with section having three angles; and of those which are incised thus like the shape of a ivy leaf, thus are the abscesses of the groin.</end_of_turn
And of those which are incised with round section and lunar section, and resembling these.</end_of_turn>
And concerning those to whom it is not possible thus as are superficial abscesses, cover that you perforate only the superficial puncture, or flatten only.</end_of_turn
And concerning the abscess which is large and has collected a great amount of pus, that you perforate it and do not fear that you will extract all of it at that moment; having extracted a part, place the abscess back into the other day, and extract a greater part the next day, and so gradually remove what is pus-filled until it is forgotten.</end_of_turn
And more if the patient is of cold temperament, or female pregnant, or a young child, or old in decrepitude, for the animal spirit of pus is resolved with the evacuation of the pus, and it is very good that the patient should recover from the illness, and you perform the operation.</end_of_turn
Be careful with this chapter, and when you puncture these abscesses, cover that you extract the purulent matter and consider therefore if the purulent matter of the abscess is little, or if it is a flat section, when you administer which of the two or both as an antidote; and if the abscess is great and the tears of the puncture are many, cover that you stop meandering in every place until they grow together.</end_of_turn
And if in the abscess a part of the cordena has been ruptured or has been flattened in the circuit, cover that you join it with old or new cloth or silk thread, just as when you have treated wounds or ulcers, its humidity; and stretch it on the third day; and thus proceed with it and care for it until the inflammation has gone away.</end_of_turn
And if there should happen to flow pus during the operation, cover that you administer cold water and vinegar in which there is a thread of silk, and stop that on the area of the flow of pus excessively purulent.</end_of_turn
And if the flow of pus should persist, cover that you administer regimen and care and powders which we have recommended in many places of our book and division.</end>
And if it is in winter, and the place of the abscess is a place of many nerves, cover that you apply powders of wine and oil caut, and place those on the places.</end>
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy, cover that you apply powders moistened with water and oil or with wine and oil, and all that is cold until the third day, as we have said, and cover that you remove the abscess and extract it and administer in its care what is necessary until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And thus is what is necessary for the knowledge of the care of abscesses universally, more however according to the way of distinguishing which we have already said of each abscess in what way it is a matter of the care of it by chapters singularly.</end_of_turn
Chapter LXI.</end_of_turn>
Of the section of abscesses which occur in the groin of the head.</end_of_turn
In the groin of the head there are small abscesses, and they contain fatty substances which are their substance; and the substances are many.</end_of_turn
And of these there are pins and those which contain humidity similar to lime.</end_of_turn And of those which contain humidity similar to pus, and resembling them; and of those which are soft and brittle.</end_of_turn
And in the section of all of them, and in the extraction of these there is no fear, as you must know the extension of these does not cause damage to the artery.</end_of_turn
And the operation in the section of these is that you expel them with an instrument of the kind which you see here, which is called an entrome, until you believe that it contains.</end_of_turn
If indeed that which is contained is moisture, then split that which is dry according to its section, superficial according to this manner.
And begin in the section of the line of B, enter the line of G. So when the moisture is evacuated, then you will scour that from which that moisture was contained, and do not leave from that any cause whatever, because the troops that were going away return, if they remain from that cause.</end_of_turn>
And immediately immerse the wound in Egyptian unguents, if it is present, or in water and salt; and fill that with that which fills the wound and leave that until tomorrow, because that which is in it corrupts all so that it remains from that wound.</end_of_turn>
And immediately repeat over that wound in Egyptian unguents according to necessity and thirdly if you suspect that there is no longer any cause of that wound; when indeed the wound has healed in the unguents.
And if after that there is fatty tissue remaining, then you will cut that according to this manner: in a straight line without forming a cross, and take nails between two layers of the section and cut that all the way through, and exert your art in extracting the membrane which contains that.</end_of_turn>
May it be that your surgery has done the contrary, but indeed I tell you that you must repeat to me first.
And in the like manner do in the fatty wound of the section and of the care according to what I have said; and the section over the fatty wound is lighter, because it has little healing and little moisture.</end_of_turn>
And many of these wounds are like those of old women whose humors are dry and hard like lead, which cannot be softened, and if anyone should attempt to pierce that, it would burst.</end_of_turn>
But in other wounds that happen in the head, there is another kind, just as in the wounds which happen in the heads of children, and you must know the causes of the carbuncles, because the sections of these are superficial sections.</end_of_turn
And stop the perforation of those which are in the lower part of them so that the body of the pain is alleviated in the lower parts.</end_of_turn
And immediately care for those with that which you are accustomed to care.</end_of_turn>
Chapter 52.</end_of_turn>
Of the section of scrophulas which happen in the groin.</end_of_turn
These wounds are caused by fat that is deposited in the groin and the heel of the foot and the flanks; and some are caused in the other parts of the body.</end_of_turn
And so those which happen in the groin, and those which are generated between them, and all scrofula of those is due to the rupture of their own membrane, just as in the nodes and the wound of the head, as we have recounted.</end_of_turn
And the species of these scrophulas are fat, because some of those are solid, and some which contain moisture, and some are malignant which do not obey care.</end_of_turn
Therefore, in that which your hand is good, whenever the color of the liquid which appears is similar to the color of cod liver, and is widespread throughout, and is not connected with the nerves of the groin, neither with the veins, nor with the incision, and is not a swelling, because you must pierce that which is soft and superficial of the part below the part of the body of the line of G between the line of B, and cut that throughout, and extend two lips of the cod liver over nails, or over pieces of nails if you need them, just as we have said concerning the wounds of the head, and extract that little by little.</end_of_turn
And it is better to be cautious not to pierce the vein or nerve.</end_of_turn
And let the spatum not be acute, that you do not put your hand too tightly on the incision, or that you frighten the patient, and that you do not pierce anything that is not necessary to pierce; for if you pierce the vein or artery you will prevent your operation, for the healing of the wound will be delayed by the blood that flows from the wound, and the wound will be opened, and leave that until the pain of the wound has ceased and the wound has become softened and the wound is becoming consolidated.</end_of_turn When the wound is closed.</end_of_turn
Therefore return to your operation until you have completed it.</end_of_turn
And inquire about the patient's belly to see if there is any other small swelling, so insert those and wash them away.
And if it is concerning a large vein, cover the time that you do not insert that swelling from its root. Then cover that with a firm fold and let it rest so that it does not fall down again.
Then fill the wound with old cloth which you have already soaked in Egyptian unguents, and care for that as well
And if you insert that swelling completely, then cover that you adjust the two lips of the wound and remove as much pus as possible so that there is no excess fluid left
Maybe sometimes there is excess fluid due to the size of the swelling, then understand its root and remove it, administer sutures and what is said.
And concerning those swellings that contain moisture, perforate that with a superficial puncture here where you see the maturation of the lesion, and stop perforating when fluid comes out from the body, as we have said before
Then administer the puncture, pour in some ointment and keep it moist, so that it dissolves what is remaining of the corruption. And when the wound has already healed, then care for it with ointment of generative herbs until it is healed completely
Chapter 133.</end_of_turn>
Of the excision of the heel of the apostemal accident that does not yield the gout.
I say that this excision in the heel has not been seen in our land that it has been successful
This is the inscription of the sermon of these things.</start_of_turn>
Maybe in women there has not been an esquinencia, so that the extraction of the heel is avoided, as it is not of any use for the healing of all the veins and the greater part of the illness is here.</start_of_turn>
Maybe in those who have apostemas caused in the mouth or heel or two anklebones, when the disease is not in the bone, it is useful to use the excision of the heel to avoid the loss which is profitable for perforation.</start_of_turn
Therefore when we want to perform it, let them puncture the heel leaving three circles of the circles of the heel, or four at a small distance for the width in that which it is between two circles in quantity, that the incision is in cartilage, not in the cartilage, and that this place is convenient for incision, because it is private of flesh and the vessels of the sanctuary are loosened.</start_of_turn
And if the doctor is timid, then let him extend the Achilles tendon at the heel with ointment, and make the incision of the tendon until it reaches the canal, but avoid the vessels of sanctuary if you see any cause of that.</start_of_turn
And then let him puncture it according to what we have recommended; and it is significant about the incision of the canal for the swelling which is from that eyeball that is with that that is broken and for the falling of the voice.</start_of_turn
And leave the wound open for some time.</start_of_turn
Therefore when the hour is ripe in which the puncture is feared, add two lips of the tendon of the wound, and only that is cartilage.</start_of_turn
And then administer medicines that make the flesh disappear until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And I say Albucasis that the sum of the sermon that we have recommended, exposure is nothing but to see that among these apostemas many of the patients have already overcome the pain of the illness, and the illness is overcome as soon as death, and the life of them is between the two, and those go to puncture the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe the air over the place of the wound with every breath, and is saved from death.</start_of_turn
And for this reason I command to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed; and the malice of it is for three days; and therefore I command you to close the wound when it is healed, and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And what I have seen for my part is that a servant brought a jug and poured it into the heel of the patient and pierced with that a part of the bone of the lung, and I was called to care for him, and I covered the mucus in the same way as it is done from the dead, and uncovered the wound and covered the flesh that was around the wound little.</start_of_turn
Therefore I confess that no swelling or inflammation had occurred, and the pain arose from the plague, and I cured that which was within as soon as the wound healed.
I did not order the maid if she did not murmur, and immediately after she returned to a better state of health.</end_of_turn>
And now I say that in the section of the heel there is no fear.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn>
Of the section concerning the swelling which occurs outside the groin, and which is called an hernia of the groin.</end_of_turn
This swelling which is called hernia of the groin is great according to the color of the body, and is not in the thighs.</end_of_turn
And it is according to two manners, that is, either natural or accidental.</end_of_turn
And in the natural it is not the work of healing.</end_of_turn
And the accidental is according to two manners, of which the one is like gooseberry knots, and the other is like swelling which is caused by the bursting of an artery, and in that there is fear.</end_of_turn And do not presume that it is like iron except for the small one.</end_of_turn And you must know that which appears like gooseberry knots, and which is not suspended from any vein, then you must prick that as though it were like nodes, and extract that which is under the skin and the fat; but if not, then all the disease must be prescribed, and you must take care of the place as much as is necessary until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn>
Of the section of the varieties of nodes.</end_of_turn
Of the nodes there are many varieties, and I have already mentioned all the varieties in the division.</end_of_turn
And you must know that I recommend that you distinguish between a node and an outgrowth, as doubt arises.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that an outgrowth is a quality of heat, fever, and severe pain until the inflammation of the fluid has subsided; and it is completed by putrefaction when the fever, the pain and the heat cease.</end_of_turn
But a node is not heat, fever, or pain, but the stone or sac that is at the root of the hair.</end_of_turn
And it is according to the color of the body, and it begins like a seed and is like wax, whether large or small, and there are two varieties, one of which is greasy and contains moisture, and the color of the moisture is varied, as I have already mentioned in the division.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you reach the treatment of a node, you must extract that and inquire about the initial cause of the pain, according to how its shape will appear in the chapter which is nearby.</end_of_turn
And this is the method of inquiry of hernias and all nodes, that you take hold of that discomfort and bring that into the most humid place that you find in the hernia, and you will remove the strings that you say with that little by little until you know that the discomfort has already penetrated the skin.</end_of_turn
And finally put your hand according to the measure of the size of the hernia, and extract the contents and consider what remains of it.</end_of_turn
And if the current moisture, whatever its color, is expelled, then you must prick it on the surface according to what I have said concerning other hernias.</end_of_turn
And if there is no moisture left of the contents, then you know that it is fat.</end_of_turn
And dry it over it with a sponge having the shape of a cross according to this form:</end_of_turn thus as I have taught you, and suspend that which is sticky, and remove the skin or sac, if possible, from that and extract the marrow from that node.</end_of_turn
But if it is fractured in the operation, it is not possible to extract that marrow, and many veins are bruised therein, and you must extract it piece by piece until there remains no cause of it.</end_of_turn
For if there remains any cause, little or much, the node will return according to the laws.</end_of_turn
If sometimes some small part remains [of the intestine or hernia], complete the evacuation of some corrosive powders and stretch the plague, and place your hand over that which is near the cautery, and care for the other cure until it is healed.
If it is great, then put two fingers of your hand over them and care for the one which is sick.
More if the pulse is contrary, or not, then you must cover the wound with a cloth of felt that is old and rough, and keep it covered for two days or three until the swelling has subsided and the redness has gone away; and then you can remove the dressing
Chapter 46.</end_of_turn>
Of the forms of the necessary instruments in incision and perforation.</end_of_turn>
Of those are the forms of the intestines, and of three sorts, that is, some are great, and some are middle-sized, and some are small.</end_of_turn
The form of the great intestine is this:</start_of_turn
The form of the small intestine is this:</start_of_turn
They are made of iron, of alum, of fallen extremities conveniently placed, so that they may hold the intestines in the apostemas.</start_of_turn
And these are the forms of the instruments, and are called tweezers, and one of them is called a needle.</start_of_turn
And of three sorts, which are great, middle-sized and small.</start_of_turn
The great instrument, its form is like this:</start_of_turn
The middle-sized instrument, its form is like this:</start_of_turn
The small instrument, its form is like this:</start_of_turn
I consider that they are for those apostemas and exits and fistulas and swellings so that between these there are bones and other causes.</start_of_turn
And they are made round, square, lion's head, as large needles with which the threads are sewn, and are made of lead, or of gold, or of iron, or of silver. The thousand are when they are made of lead.</start_of_turn
And they are made of black plum nails, which are remembered that for those it is opened the fistulas in the concavity of which are reflections, that are reflected back from their elevation with those reflections.</start_of_turn
And of three sorts, which some are long, and of others are middle-sized, and of others are short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the stricture of it.</start_of_turn
The form of the great instrument of plum:
The form of the middle-sized instrument of plum:
The form of the small instrument of plum:
The forms of nails are of various species, which are either simple, which have only a single curve, or of three sorts: great, small and middle-sized.</start_of_turn
And of these there are blunt nails, and of three sorts.</start_of_turn
And of these there are nails having two curves, and of three sorts.</start_of_turn
And of these there are nails having three curves, and of three sorts.</start_of_turn
And all these are necessary in their place.</start_of_turn
The form of a small simple nail, its form is like this:</start_of_turn
The form of a great nail having two curves:</start_of_turn The form of a middle-sized nail having two curves:</start_of_turn Form a single pouch having two curves:
Form a single pouch having three curves:
Form a single pouch having four curves
These are the shapes of the scalpels with which we dissect and scorch nodes and abscesses, and there are three kinds, which are great, middle, and small.
The great knife-shaped pouch
The middle knife-shaped pouch
The small knife-shaped pouch
The extremities of those with which incision is made are acute, and the others are not acute. They are not to be held in such a way, but rather so as to facilitate the excision of nodes, for fear of injuring a vein or nerve. And for those, the patient must be quiet and calm to facilitate the process of excision of the abscess
These are the shapes of sponges, and there are three kinds: great, middle, and small, just like sponges.
They are useful for haemostasis and resemble bristles of a brush with which alcohol is used.
And in the extremity where the puncture is made with hidden sponge and in which there runs to the intestines and outwards, when you want, just as you see it
The shapes of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers, must pierce abscesses without causing pain to the patient, and there are three kinds: great, middle, and small. These are the shapes of these things:
The shapes of syringes with which the flow of blood is obstructed, and there are three kinds: great, middle, and small.
They are useful for citrus juice, round with any length, and are subtle
And you must take these three kinds of syringes because they are necessary to obstruct the flow of blood with velocity in necessity, and when you first arrive it is not medicine.
But do not use them to obstruct blood in any part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places, such as in the lacerations of the veins and arteries, and in the lacerations of the cartilages, and of the breasts, belly and armpits, resembling the lacerations of fleshy humps
And many herbs are useful for these instruments and other small things resembling fish skin scales according to this form; for which the blood is obstructed when it is necessary for phlebotomy, or for incision of a vein or artery.
And many herbs are useful for their round shape according to this form
End of document.
Of the care of the breasts of men which are composed of women.
Some herbs cause the breasts of tall men to swell due to lack of sleep like the beginning of the pallus, and so they swell the breasts and assemble the breasts of women, and remove abscesses, leaving.
And to him who complains of this, I say that you must make an incision with a lunar knife according to this form, from the line of B to the line of G, and carefully remove the whole hardness, and replace the wound with a medicinal plaster, and adjust the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for the inside that it should be healthy
More so if the breast hangs downwards towards the thighs and is softened by its magnitude just as it happens with women, when it is split into two lateral parts with two cuts resembling a lunar shape, of which each contains the other one because the major line contains the minor one according to this form of the line of B and the line of G. And so remove the cord which is between two lips of the wound, and keep the swelling, and administer what we have said of the suture and the powders that are necessary for the care until it is healthy
And if you do not comply with the incision to which I recommend for the discomfort of the patient and for the flow of blood, then I say that you must cover the wound with fat soaked in corrosive ointment and leave that which is dissolved by the ointment, and care for that which remains until it is healthy

Aquetz apostemas that remain tingling so from the species of scrofulas, persistent, which contain a bag that is sac
And from those that contain humidity; and those that contain humidity cover that they should be incised at the end of the lunar phase according to this figure: from the line G to the line B. And when everything is evacuated from the boil of the woman, then you should complete the pot belly and leave it inside until tomorrow.
And bring the pot belly both front and back to the convenience of the water, until it is healed.
And if the boil is of the species of the nodes, and of the scrophulas, then you split over that area as we have said in the section about the scrophulas in general

When an arrow is broken, and the cord is consolidated which is over that, then move the veins away from the wound that has occurred; for it is known that inflammation and swelling of the boil occur from the artery or vein: for when the boil is by arrow, it is long aggregated in the front of the body; and when it is by vein, sit on the thighs until the boil has subsided
And that which is by vein is returned to the sign of the body.
And the section about this boil is wrong, and above all in those who leave the hairs, and in the armpits, and in the groin, and in many parts of the body; and it is not great, therefore cover that its cure by fire should be avoided, and that which is in the extremities, or at the head, should be avoided.
May about that which is from their for inflammation of the orifice of the arrow, split in the cord section in length; and immediately cover the section with lead and cover the arrow, and release from the tunics until it is discovered
And immediately put over that needle and make that penetrate through to the other side, and tighten the arrow with a double thread in two places, — which causes and helps in the extraction of two arrows that are in the temples
And immediately put between two ligaments with some space until the wound is healed, and that the boil is dissolved
And immediately administer care in which is engendered poor people until the ligaments fall down; and care that is convenient in water until it is healed
And if the boil is by cutting of a vein, then cover that you have at your hand over the boil with the cord, and immediately insert the needle except for the place where you have had your hand, and make that penetrate; and be in that fold double until you extract that from the other side, and immediately ligate the boil with good thread as I have said above in the section of two parts at two extremities of the fold.
May if you fear that they will extract the thread, then immediately insert the thread with that needle except for that part where you put the first needle, and strengthen the thighs with four threads in four places.
And immediately dry the boil in the middle of it until when it is wet that the cord will be split, and leave that which is bound to it.
And immediately stop over the dust that you have submerged in wine and oil, and immediately administer the care that is useful with lukewarm water and grease until it is healed
Capital l of the boil that occurs by twisting of nerves.
Just as it occurs with an arrow and a vein, and in the same way that it occurs with nerves when it occurs to them for percussion or occurs by excessive work, and for a similar reason.
And it is useful more in the places of the assistants or the thigh, or in any place in which there are swollen joints.
And the boil is difficult, and is assembled like that of the other body, and is in the greatest part of the time accompanied by its discharge and when it is stretched violently, sitting in the place the patient is in a stupor.
And it is not aggregated in the front of the body, and for so it is left whole, and is swollen throughout and does not go to the parts before or behind
Therefore, that which is in the joints should not be enclosed with iron, for that would cause greater contraction.
Do not put anything on the head or face, for that would burn the skin. If there is only a little swelling, then do not force it, but cut away that which is causing the swelling.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a bandage, and remove that which is causing the swelling; then place another bandage over that; and suture the wound securely, and care for that until it is healed.
End of treatment.
From the excision of the swelling which happened from the cheek to the belly.
Therefore, those people who are suffering from wounds caused by fungi on their chests and other parts of their body because they are similar to those which are on the fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and their lips are dry, and it is from these that the swelling arises, which is small and not significant.
I have already seen one of these, and in their belly were two others which were like fungi in appearance, and there was no difference between those which were white, of little root.
And their lips were cracked and bled, and moisture ran from their bodies all the time
Therefore I advise you to immerse them in cold water until the pain subsides and the other until you see an improvement
And as for the operation concerning the wound, you must consider if the illness is acute or chronic; and if the color of the wound is white, moist, of subtle root. Then you should burn with a spatula made of lead, while you are in my presence, and evacuate the swelling with the cautery; and if you think the illness is healed, burn that which remains.
And if sometimes the illness is slight and the patient is fearful, do not burn with iron; but rather take a recent blister and strengthen that wound, for which the manner is that which we have learned; and let it rest for two days
Then adjust the tension of the thread of the blister; therefore, do not cease strengthening the blister greatly until it is detached and falls off by itself
And if the wound is large, then in the incision there is some cause for fear and anxiety, especially in that which is in the belly
It is possible that you must cut away the greater part of it, and then burn that which remains to prevent it from returning
And take care of that until the wound is healed
And keep in mind that you should not attempt to burn that which is of a yellowish color, of little sensation, of regular consistency, for that which is abscess is dead flesh
And I recall that there is a similar custom to this.

On the care of the umbilical cord.
The umbilical cord is useful for many causes; or for fissures of the pericardium which is over the belly, and these you should cover with a cloth or bandage as in other ruptures; or to heal which flows from veins or from arteries as it is said, or for excessive wind that is constrained in it
And if it is for a fissure of the pericardium and for the swelling of the cloth, the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the flesh; and it is painful, and it appears in various situations And if it is for the discharge of the intestine, the situation of that which we have mentioned above is more diverse, and as you have heard that which is said to be hidden is occultated, and you should return it; and it is painful for it so, and is magnified more than is necessary to remove the intestines and excessive work
And if it is for moisture, it is painful and is not occultated when you put your hand on it, nor is it constricted, nor is it tense
And if it is for healing, the swelling appears black and declining.
And if it is for nothing, the swelling is difficult, large and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity
And if it is for excessive wind, the touch of it is painful
The operation is that you must consider if the prominence of the navel is for the safety of the gut, or of a vein, or for infection; that you must abstain from its cure in such a case, for there is fear and danger in doing otherwise as you have been taught in the chapter where I mentioned the apostemas for gut and vein.
If the prominence of the navel is for the intestine or for the flesh, you must command the patient to lie still, and be extended; and you must tie at the circumference of all the navel, and command him to stay between your thighs over the two buttocks; and you must surround the circumference of the navel around the area where you have made the incision; and you must extend the greater part of the apostema to the parts below with one hand; and you must bind firmly or loosely in the circumference with your other hand and the manner of the surgeon.</end_of_turn>
And you must cover the extended part of the apostema over the ligament and introduce the thumb of your hand into that place and you will search for the intestine; and if you have found it or retained it for the ligament, you must extract the foreign body and bring the intestine back to the parts below the belly.</end_of_turn>
If you have found the flesh, take hold of it with one hand; and cut away its excess.</end_of_turn>
May it be contrary to your incision or vein, you must circle around that area, and return to your operation; take two needles and pierce through those two holes firmly, and insert two needles into the circumference which you have made around the apostema in the manner of a cross, which will pass through; and then strengthen the apostema in four parts over the needles.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, leave the needles in and leave the extended flesh until it falls off by itself; or cut away that which is subtle and falls off, and take care of that which covers the intestines until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if the prominence of the navel is from nothing in it or for moisture, you must compress the apostema as we have said and extract the abscess or moisture which you find in it, and take care of that which covers and consolidates the area.</end_of_turn>

On the treatment of abscess.</end_of_turn
We have already said, in the division, about the species of abscess and how it is best to treat it with medicine, and that it is dangerous to treat it with iron so that it does not become ulcerated; and we have said that abscesses are produced by great heat and caution in treating them.</end_of_turn
The ancients say that some abscesses are in places where it is impossible to eradicate them, thus as those which are in the armpits or in the groin and to whom it is ordered to extract all of them, and more especially when they are starting small.</end_of_turn
More when it is old and hard, do not attempt to touch it, for I have never seen it healed by any means, neither have I heard of any, nor is it possible that it should be healed by anything.</end_of_turn
And the operation for it is when it is ordered as we have said, that you precede and make the patient vomit, and purge with black bile several times, and then apply a poultice if it is found to be soft.</end_of_turn
And prepare the patient in the preparation in which he is located in the operation, and order in the tract needles which cover that; and compress from all parts of the wound as much as the bandage will permit until no cause of the cause of the abscess remains.</end_of_turn Let it drain naturally, and do not prick it deliberately, and press the wounds, and dry the wound thoroughly with your hand or any instrument at your disposal.</end_of_turn
More if in your opinion there is great pus in the vein or artery, cauterize that so that the flow of the pus is stopped, and take care of the other treatment until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter 45.</end_of_turn
On the treatment of hydrosis.</end_of_turn
We have already mentioned, in the division, the species of hydrosis of the water, and their signs, and how to treat them with medicine.</end_of_turn
And that which is treated with iron is nothing but the simple kind of hernia, and is not approached with iron to the kind of tympani or the kind of fistula, for that is deadly.</end_of_turn
When you have already medicated this kind of tympanic hydrosis with medicines and do not find comfort in your medicine, consider that if the patient has already achieved recovery, or is suffering from another disease, even if it is in the head or belly and resembling those, do not give him iron, for fear of that.</end_of_turn
May it be that sometimes the patient is affected with excessive thirst, and that this is not another disease but only hydropathy alone, neither young nor old, for the manner of the operation in this case is that you elevate the patient's thirst between your hands, and minister to them with your hand the expression of their belly, filling the water to the level of the fifth rib, and immediately take a sponge of thorns in this fashion:
Both parts of the sponge are acute in length, with an acute extremity like a sponge; however, take each one in small degrees, so that in the process there does not pass into the belly, and that you leave each one behind.</end_of_turn>
And consider if the generation of hydropathy is from the bowels, for in this case you must remove the section from the navel for the amount of three fingers below the fifth rib.</end_of_turn>
However, if the generation of hydropathy is due to a disease of the spleen, then the section must be taken to the left of the navel for three fingers.</end_of_turn>
If the generation is from the liver, then the section is in the right.</end_of_turn>
And do not let the section be over the rib on which the patient is vomiting, for it does not run the risk of causing the juices to leak to that area.</end_of_turn
And with the instruments pierce the cord, and enter into that section, and elevate your hand with the sponge between the cord and the liver, and extract that; and if there is the amount of a nail or two.</end_of_turn
And pierce the liver until the sponge reaches the level of the water.</end_of_turn And immediately extract that and insert an instrument of this shape: It is similar to a silver needle; it is made of silver or ebony or gold, and in the lower part of it is a small hole, and on the sides of it are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and the head is blunt according to the manner of a feather, as sometimes.</end_of_turn
And at the end of the instrument there is an arm, for when the instrument reaches the water, so that much water comes out of the instrument at that moment, for if you evacuate less than that in an hour, it will be too little to cure the disease for the resolution of the vital spirit, or for the injuries to the fifth pair, which is near death.</end_of_turn
Evacuate in this way according to the quantity of the virtue of the water and according to what you understand from the patient's disease of the virtue of the pulse and the hardness of the water.</end_of_turn
And immediately extract the instrument, and retain the water that causes this because it is retained by the cord that is over the hole that is on the liver, and command you to perform this according to that manner.</end_of_turn
And repeat the instrument again the next day if sometimes the patient tolerates this, and evacuate a small quantity of water, and do this for several days for fear, and keep yourself away from error until there remains little water left.</end_of_turn
However, if you fear about the patient, and you see a great quantity of water, then cure him by burying him in warm sand, wash him with bath, and expose him to the sun for a long time; and cure him with drying medicines until he is healed.</end_of_turn
And cauterize over the stomach, the liver and the spleen according to the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.</end_of_turn>

Concerning the care of children who are born with unperforated bladder.</end_of_turn
Some of the children are born with their bladder still connected to the womb, and the head of the mixture is not perforated (or is slightly torn or is not in its place).</end_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to pierce it as little as possible as is born with a sponge moist without being harmful according to this manner.</end_of_turn
And immediately stop the bleeding with a lead nail and bind it, and keep it for three days or for three quarters.</end_of_turn
When he wants to urinate, he will be able to urinate; and immediately return that.</end_of_turn
And if you do not stop the lead, it is possible that the urine that goes over the area will not be able to go through this nail.</end_of_turn
The pain is immediate and severe, like that of a thumb that has been struck by lightning.
The pain that causes the swelling is not in the joints, so it is not a normal gout; rather, it is caused by the head of the kidney being swollen up so that it cannot urinate downwards, until the kidney is lifted up by the hand to the parts below; and it is not due to any other cause, for so the sperm does not reach its maturity according to its course, and is a disease of the bladder.
And the way of operating in this case is that the patient is placed on the two hips, and then the head of the kidney is grasped by your left hand with violent extraction, and the head of the kidney is pierced at the place of the perineum with a pointed instrument, just like a puncture of the quill, or that you do not take away any part of it, for so the semen will remain like the head of the kidney and the pain will fall in the middle of the belly as it should.</end_of_turn>
And take care that in your operation for the flow of urine, no other matter occurs; and stop when you have opened the bladder, and care for the wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
End of document.
Concerning the swelling that occurs in the prepuce and the head of the kidney, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the kidney.
These matters are observed to cause this swelling in the kidney, and is an ailment of the bladder
And from these two there is one that is malignant and the other that is not malignant.</start_of_turn>
Non-malignant, because you suspend with a single sponge and evacuate it when it is done; and then stop over that cavity covered in Egyptian unguent; and do the same with the other, cure it with the unguent diafinicon until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the swelling is malignant, of dark color, then you must administer pointed cautery near the incision and the ratio of the cautery.
Moreover, if the swelling is in the prepuce of the head of the kidney, it is not a circumcision; and one part of the swelling is downwards the prepuce and the other part is outwards; then you must keep the swelling that is downwards until it is consolidated; and when you have cured that which is outwards, for when you have cured that the prepuce will not be torn
And indeed, these matters occur in the genitals and in the prepuce of blackening and corruption, where you must conquer all that has already become degenerate and that has already become corrupted or that has already become rotten; and then apply pressure over that until almost all that has been softened is like millet flour and tears that are split and crushed.</start_of_turn
And do the same with the other cure until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Moreover, if the flow of urine is delayed, then administer lunar cautery in this way:
because the lunar cautery is two-faced, so it is with the flow of urine and the wound when it is corrupted.</start_of_turn>
And if the head of the kidney is corroded and is destroyed in an hour, then you must insert into the meat of the prepuce a a plum catheter so that the patient can urinate through that.</start_of_turn
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the kidney (and this adhesion does not occur except in the one in which the prepuce is soft, and over which circumcision is not required; and when it occurs by ulcer or fistula) you must scrape with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the kidney is freed entirely.</start_of_turn
And if it is difficult to remove these things, then you must scrape with a spatula over the head of the kidney and the prepuce, and you must know that when the prepuce is soft, when it is fluid, it is easily perforated by its softness.</start_of_turn
And then separate the prepuce from the head of the kidney with a strip of silk, which already is softened by the cold water so that it does not adhere to any other matter.</start_of_turn
And do the same with the wound with vinegar until it is solidified.</start_of_turn
End of document.</start_of_turn>
Of the upbringing of children and the care of what occurs to those undergoing circumcision.</start_of_turn
Circumcision is not a solution to continuity as indeed other diseases: however, since it is in our operation and our will, and because of that it is properly done in children, it is necessary that we assign in that manner a better operation and a less painful loss of health.</start_of_turn
Therefore I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their laws, for they did not use it in their customs. It is true that we have learned through experience that it causes aversion among the artificers and barbers. They now use circumcision and mutilation with new and unfamiliar instruments; and they use thread of fine quality and incision at the nail.
I have already tried all these methods, and I do not approve of any mutilation with forceps, thread of fine quality like that used in circumcision, for in mutilation with the nail the pulp often escapes, as the pulp of the prepuce is doubled over two tunics, and remains tense beyond, and it is forced to another incision and severe pain. As for digital mutilation, which is useful for alphbetization, and which is practiced by barbers, it is not accompanied by the incision of the extremity of the member viril, for it penetrates the tissue of it.</end_of_turn>
Moreover, in the operation with the nail, one must observe great caution and avoid breaking the skin, for this will corrupt your operation.</end_of_turn> And the cord of the child is short by nature, and often it is not necessary to mutilate in this way, for I have seen many who have escaped without mutilation.</end_of_turn>
Moreover, from experience I have learned that the use of forceps and fine thread is better, for the acute sensation that arises from the incision is equal to that which remains when the hand is placed over the area; and therefore when you press your hand in proportion to the acute sensation, and make the incision according to a comparison in a timely manner, it is useful to compress the thread with a figure containing the whole of the cord, so that there is no error of any kind.</end_of_turn>
The first way to perform the operation is that the patient should be in a state of greater calmness if he is of those who understand little, do not hesitate but bind the thread to his member alone, and observe whether he has bled by the next day.</end_of_turn
Therefore do whatever you can to make him happy in this way that is within your power, for he receives your intelligence.</end_of_turn And do whatever you can to make him appear more poised, and do not be absent-minded; and conceal the forceps in your hand or place them on the foot of the patient, so that the child does not see them or any other instruments.</end_of_turn
And put your hand on the member and blow on the cord, and pull that out until the head of the cord is completely severed, and then mutilate that which is added to it by moisture.</end_of_turn
The way of the forceps in mutilation, this is the way:
They are blunt at the extremities and sharp in the middle, so that it does not catch the skin of the clitoris, and the length of the two acute angles is equal to the length of two thumbs clasped together.</end_of_turn
Moreover, the error in mutilation is that it often escapes the intrinsic cord entirely, or part of it must be left out of the incision.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must extend your hand at the opportune moment with your nail to indicate the swelling of the area and make the incision according to equality.</end_of_turn
Or if you do not have your nail, you can extract that with your hand and make the incision.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if three days have passed and the swelling of the member has subsided, when the cord has become softened again, you must wait until it has receded completely, and then gently extract it, making the incision as before.</end_of_turn
And take care of the head of the cord, so that it does not swell up again.</end_of_turn
Therefore care for it as we have recommended in the treatise of powders.</end_of_turn
If it is necessary to make the incision deeper, and you obey these parts, then you will not notice it.</end_of_turn
E mayes cura aquel am aquo que havem dit entro que sia sano.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Treatment for retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by full bladder due to stones or sand, or by weakness or paralysis, or by tumors, and is treated in the same way as the methods mentioned in the division
And if the stone has not been dissolved by the methods mentioned above, it is useful to make an extraction with an instrument called a siringue, which is like this: made of silver or bronze, with a tube like a pen with a bulb at the end like a palm and a half, and a tube of the same material at the top.
And the method for extracting the urine is as follows: grasp the catheter tube doubled and tie it at the end of the bladder or the hip bones for good support. Insert the catheter tube into the opening of the bladder through the forfexes if necessary, but do not force it. Then advance the catheter slowly and steadily through the tube into the bladder.
And make the patient sit up, and bandage the bladder with a cloth and olive oil and urine.
And then insert the catheter slowly and steadily through the opening of the bladder; and when it has reached the bottom of the bladder, bend the bladder downwards at the level of the umbilical cord; then hold the catheter firmly in place with one hand, and with the other hand massage the area around the bladder. The patient will feel relief when the stone has passed, and not before
And gradually withdraw the catheter along with the stone, so that the urine will flow freely from the bladder
Then extract the stone and care for the urine, and use the siringue, do not do anything else and use the siringue until the bladder is empty and the patient is relieved of the pain.
End of document
Of the quality of the cleansing of the bladder with clamps and instruments that are in agreement with the aforementioned things.
When in the bladder there is an ulcer or swelling, or a stone, or if it is coarsened by reduced power, and you wish to drain urine and medicines, then it is useful to use a clamp to extract them. This is how it is done:
But if the urine is silent in the extraction, then it is closed And there are three veins: two from one side, thus as many times
At the beginning is the bladder, which is filled with urine, and according to the quantity that fills it, so many veins. When any cause is overcome by that which is taken away from the humors, it is thrown out, and when it is expelled with the urine, it is thrown out with the urine, and when it is expelled far away, as the clamp throws it out which remains on the battlefield of the sea.
Therefore when you wish to remove the humors from the bladder, insert the clamp into the humor and pull out the urine that is filled in the parts above, because the humor is expelled in the concavity of the clamp
And then insert the clamp into the bladder according to what has been recommended in the siringue; and hold the humor with the urine, because that humor will reach the bladder again and relieve the patient of that.
Method of sub-uro-cutaneous crystallization of the bladder, which is as follows:
And it is useful to make it of silver or of lead, of which the head is similar to a small pen, and to hold it with a ligament

And for certain from the stone within that it stays let go of the toe that speaks. And convert that little bit by little into the belly of the bladder.
And place your hand over that little toe that speaks, and expel that to the outside of the limb from which you made the incision.
And command the minister to hold the bladder with his hand; and command another minister to extend his right hand and grasp the gluteal region with his left hand, in the part where the incision was made
And thus comes out the spleen with great violence in this way: and tears between the hip and the gluteal region, not in the middle of the limb, from the side of the left thigh; and let the incision be made upon that stone, that is to say on the heel of the little toe that speaks, and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision outside is wide enough and deep according to the quantity that comes out of the stone, and not more, for fear that it compresses the little toe which is in the heel of the stone from which the incision is made and is forced out by its defect.
And know that from the stone there is some angle and margin, for that its evacuation is difficult for that reason.
And from that liquid there is some that is like gum, and is round, and it is its lightness that makes its evacuation difficult.
Therefore if it is that one from which there are angles and margins, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not thus forced out, then you must keep your hand over that [area] or strengthen over that part adequately, the limb of which is like a limb to the stone that you strengthen over the stone, and do not pull it away from it; or that you insert your left hand under the limb.
Or if you cannot do that, then you must make a small incision, and if you see a flow of pus, cut through that yellow bile that has been clotted.
Or if the stone is more than one, then at the beginning you must place your hand at the mouth of the bladder, and then make an incision thereupon; and then insert a little bit of liquid; and thus do if there are several stones of more than two.
Or if the stone is great, know that ignorance is that you make a great incision, which will cause the patient two evils: that it remains or that it hinders the continuous dripping of urine, because the limb is not completely consolidated
Or give expulsion of it until it is expelled, or manage in the fracture of it with forceps until you extract that in pieces.
Therefore when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloes and bandage it with oil, and strengthen that And rest upon that limb immersed in oil and vinegar, or in oiled rose oil and fresh water, so that the afterburn of the cautery is softened.
And let the patient rest upon the bed of the couch, and do not remove the bandage until the third day
And when that has gone away, bathe the limb in water and oil, and care for that limb with diaphano and diabasicillinum until it is healed.
Or if there is left afterburn from the cautery, adhere and soften it, and from that it looks as if the urine is frozen in the bladder, and for that the urine is prohibited (for that is known as the escape of the urine with the blood), then insert the little toe into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it will cause the bladder to corrupt and putrefy
And finally wash the wound with wine, water and salt, and against all spices, against that which is useful for its cure until it is healed
And keep in all the hours of care that you lie both thighs together and adjust the medicines that are placed over the limb.
Or if the stone is small and is in the meat of the heel, and is fixed there, and the escape of urine is prohibited, then know that you must perform an incision with a needle, of which this is the form:
triangular, extracted, fixed in flesh.<end_turn>

And now prick upon that side of the great toe where the cause of the pain lies, and bring the stone to that place, so that the stone does not remain alongside the bone that causes it.
The incision should be slight at first; then introduce the needle over that area, and when you feel the stone, adjust its position in the incision according to the quantity that you know the stone will be removed.</end_of_turn>
You must know that the species of stones are many: some are slight and great, some are sharp and rough, some are long and round, and some have ramps.</end_of_turn>
Therefore you must know what kind of stone it is that you are dealing with, in order to know what you are saying about it.</end_of_turn>
And if you see blood flowing, close the blood vessel that is bleeding and hold it closed for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation once the stone has been removed.</end_of_turn
And let preparations be made for your instruments which are needed in the extraction of stones from the body, so that you may be assisted by them in your operation.</end_of_turn>
And if you see blood flowing, and you know that the evacuation of blood comes from the artery which has been punctured, then you must stop the bleeding by pressing your thumb over the area and loosening that bundle of vessels, and do not proceed further; leave the stone and do not extract it, for its strength will cause the disease to worsen.</end_of_turn> Take care of the wound.</end_of_turn>
Therefore when the acute pain of the blood has subsided after a few days, and the wound has healed, then you may return to your operation once the stone has been removed.</end_of_turn
Chapter lxii.</end_of_turn>
Of incision concerning hernia.</end_of_turn
A hernia is simply an accumulation of moisture in the white sac which contains the codename of the thighs, which is called the sac of hernias.</end_of_turn
And sometimes the cause is in the proper belly which nature has prepared in that place for the fluid, until it is understood that there is already another fluid; and that is the codename of the thigh between the white sac which we have mentioned, and it is not simply water but pus.</end_of_turn
The generation of this hernia is due to excessive weight which occurs to the thighs, because at these there is an infiltration of this matter, and sometimes it occurs by a pointed wound which is made on the thighs.</end_of_turn
And this moisture has various colors, for its color can be greenish or bloodstained, or yellow, or black and fetid, or white and watery, and that is the best.</end_of_turn
These are the signs by which we know that the accumulation of fluid is in the white sac which we have mentioned: when it is in the sac of hernias, the opening is rounded, declining slightly in length like a figure of water, and the thigh appears, for the fluid contains all around it.</end_of_turn
And if the moisture is in the proper belly, the opening is rounded at the part of the thigh and in this way we estimate that there is already another fluid.</end_of_turn
And if the moisture is between the codename of the thighs and the white sac, then the cat is left behind.</end_of_turn
And when you want to know the color of the moisture, then show the color of the moisture in the opening along with the color of the surrounding substance which precedes the shape; and according to what is seen in the remnants, judge what is contained.</end_of_turn
Therefore when we come to the treatment of it, we must command the patient to take nourishment if it is possible, and sometimes the body itself becomes full.</end_of_turn
And let there be rest upon the hips two above any cause a little higher, and put down the movement of the drapes.</end_of_turn
And let you sit on the left side of the patient, and command the minister to follow on the right side of the patient, who will extend his thumb to one side of the thighs and to the part of the navel of the belly.</end_of_turn
And then take a sponge broad and cut the thigh bone along the length through almost the fifth of the inch.</end>
And the incision should be made according to the rule at an equal distance from the line that must be drawn on the skin of the thighs, until it reaches the white sac encompassing.</end_of_turn
E excorja aquel, e observa, e guarda te per aysso que tu no inscidas aquel; e la tua excoriacio am la qual aquel excorjas per partida jassia que sia suspenduda am le huou mays e subtilment escruta am la excoriacio segon la quantitat a tu possibla.
And thus perforate the sac filled with water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water
And thus separate between two ribs the section with nails, and stretch the sac downwards; do not touch the cartilage of the hips encompassing it, and pierce the sac in such a way as is convenient for you And pierce it entirely or in parts, and more especially with blunt needles, because if you do not carefully observe the puncture of them, it is not safe that the water does not return
If, however, blood proceeds from that wound during the operation, when you have completed the section of the sac, return that blood, and adjust the two ribs of the hips with sutures, and take care of the wound in the same way as the others, until it is healed
And if you find the blood corrupted by another disease, when you have closed the blood vessels which are the source of the swelling, extract the blood, and take care of the wound as we have said before
And if the water is gathered in two parts, it is because there are two hernias; therefore pierce that part as you have done with the other equally; and if you are of the opinion that it is an operation, then do it
And thus take out the intestines, and put them into the lancets submerged in oil or in oiled wool; and after that take another layer of lancets which you have submerged in wine and oil, and spread that over two hips and the belly; and put over that other layers of cloth which you have folded and powder, and tie those over in the manner described above
And thus take two cloths and fill them with tightly wound wool according to this shape; and tie the extremities with which you wish to cover the wound, and which are covered with fat or wet wool, and join them with a structure at the groin of the thighs, and one of the extremities extends over two toes, and the second over the heel of the foot, and two over two toes of the feet and two over two ankles, and join all the sutures in the groin of the thighs
And many hernias of this kind are treated artificially with cautery in place of incision with a knife; and that you take a pointed cautery and insert it into that area where you wish to make the incision, and ignite it as we have recommended until you discover the white sac containing the water, and then you take out the cautery in this manner: and so on in Greek letters.
And thus pierce that sac, and it is ignited until all the moisture is driven out
And thus stretch the sac with nails, and excoriate with nails, and excoriate with pointed cautery ignited; and pierce that part as you are able until you have drained all of it; and take care that the fire does not touch the water
And you must know that this operation is more safe and more long-lasting than an incision
Though it may seem contrary to your custom in the act of incision or cautery, or the flow of blood, you must know that you must take care of any discomfort which occurs to you because of this, with the care which is appropriate for it as has been said.
Though the disease be slight and you do not expect a second operation on account of its horror, you must administer the perforation as I have recommended; and it is when you are certain that you must do so, because of the signs we have mentioned, that the hernia is harmless
You must know that you must place the patient on any elevated surface, and pierce the abscess in the lower part of it with the palm of your hand, and stop the perforation according to the length of the body
And the opening must be wide enough to drain out all the water
And thus place over the area the elbow and bind that and leave that, so that the water remains drained out And take care that the wound is healed
Though if there is an emission of water at that moment you pierce that: and that is not useful except for that which is contained in the white sac in the orifice of the wound which makes resistance to the flow of water, for it hinders the emptying of the water from the abscess; you must therefore bring into the wound some other means or instrument with which to extract the water from the abscess, or adjust in the vicinity of the wound a little instrument.
The water returns and is diluted about every six months or in the spring; and when it is diluted, the pain is pierced according to that custom, so that the patient will pass these seven days.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the incision of a carbuncular hernia and its treatment.</start_of_turn
You know that in the incision of this hernia there is fear of losing the bowels in the greater parts; for I have seen the dismissal of them and their preservation for this good.</start_of_turn
And I remember the operation in this case and the species of apostemas.</start_of_turn
Therefore, I say that apostemas arise in the bodies of those who have congenital disorders and are caused by several causes: or for sudden excessive moisture, which is spread on the genitals, or for percussion.</start_of_turn
The color of the apostema is according to the color of the body, and it is not found in pain, and it is a hard apostema.</start_of_turn
And it is most likely that it is a softened apostema, of which the color is dark, and which is not firm to the touch.</start_of_turn
And various causes are caused by the nodulation of arteries, and by the inflammation of those which are already perceived, or by the inflammation of veins.</start_of_turn
More frequently, however, it is known as the dispersion of the apostema when you press on those parts which are called testicles; and it does not suffice that you touch them.</start_of_turn
More frequently, the one that is caused by the inflammation of veins is not dispersed by any cause except for compression of those parts.</start_of_turn
And indeed it is possible that in this case the incision is useful and on the others; and that you insert the hook of the genetius, and draw out the fluid from the parts below, and extract the white pith from the spleen, and deliver the bile from the veins, and ligate them, and insert more bile than you deliver from every part of the fluid.</start_of_turn
Therefore if the fluid is already in those hardened parts, the hour covers that you extract the fluid and insert that.</start_of_turn
And if there is adhesion between any cause of the spleen, or between those which are between the veins, the hour covers that you deliver all that adhesion and insert that by incision round.</start_of_turn
More frequently if there is birth from flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, the hour covers that you insert all that which is of it, and extract the fluid just as we said.</start_of_turn
Therefore when your operation is completed, the hour fills the wound with soft fat in olive oil and wine; and take care of that as well as the other care that is to be taken until it is healed.</start_of_turn
End of text.</start_of_turn
Of the treatment of hernia which is of the vital kind.</start_of_turn
It is a hard apostema enveloped by any covering similar to a sprout with mollification of the testicles, and it is difficult for the patient to exercise and walk on the affected side.</start_of_turn
And in the treatment of this disease is to fear that which precedes the memory.</start_of_turn
However we must say that we do the operation according to what is first said.</start_of_turn
I say that you should place the patient on a high cushion; and in the thighs place the hooks of the testicles to the sides; and take hold of the hook of the genetius with the thumbs of the hands which are to be operated on; and have those other attendants whom you have, and extend those with violent extension.</start_of_turn
And insert with a blunt knife a cutting incision through the middle of the veins until the veins are uncovered.</start_of_turn
And extract from every part as much as you have said in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.</start_of_turn
And leave in those a needle with a double head, and tie that in the first place of the area where the vital hit, and tie that other thread at the back of them.</start_of_turn And insert those in the middle of the belly for transverse incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is added of the foul and corrupt humors.</start_of_turn
And so treat the plague with the care of other plagues from which you desire to be cured so that they fall from the veins that would cause one of two genes, which is not harmful for this.
May be the veins may be burst, but it is necessary that the testicles be extracted or that they be softened by the veins, for that is private of all nourishment for the beginning of the veins, and that they be established, or that they be softened so that they are not harmful to those.
Chapter 65
Of the treatment of an intestinal hernia
The coming of this hernia is because of a tear that runs into the extended sac over the belly from the angles of the miracle of the belly, because giving way the bulges of that break are to some of the bulges
And this break is either of the sac or of the hernia, and this happens for various causes: either percussion, or sneezing, or crying, or elevation of any difficult cause, or for lying down.
And the sign of this, when it is for the extension of the sac, is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen immediately, and is appeased as soon as the pressure is released from the belly by the pain
And the sign of this is when it is for a tear of the sac, that at the beginning it causes sharp pain immediately; and it is appeased differently from the apparent cause, except that the corden is close to the apparent cause, and that is for the bruising of the belly, and the body of the hernia to the parts surrounding the sac
And every other food is forgotten in the belly, and this hernia intestinal is called for this reason.
And some foods are fat with wind, and some foods run in the belly wound, and here it is retained, and that is very harmful for the illness, and some foods cause great pain and especially when it is pressed
And in the treatment of this illness it is feared, for that it covers that it be escaped from the wound in that place
And the manner of performing the operation of that is that you command the patient to reduce the belly with his hand to the depths of his concavity if he obeys the surgeon's command, and then you are to wrap around his belly with a cloth between your hands, and elevate his legs.
And so tighten the cord that ties the testicles to the parts below, and cut the cord of the testicles throughout; and then fix two fingers of your hand at the two angles of the incision as you would to open the incision with those
And if it is possible for you according to the quantity that you are able to do that from that there should be no remains left
And so remove that purulent liquid that is left from the cord of the testicles, until the white sac is discovered from any part
Then you will enter the intestine said to be between the testicles, between the white sac which is left from the cord of the urine, and between the sac according, and remove that adhesion that is in the part behind the bladder
And so touch with your hand the cord of the testicles to the parts surrounding, and with my left hand extend the white sac downwards, and elevate the bladder with the sac towards the incision; and command the assistant to extend the bladder outwards and you will dissolve the adhesion that is behind with a completed solution
And look that there is no cause for the belly being covered with the white sac again And if you find any cause of this in it, then you will leave it in the belly behind
And then we penetrate the area below the testicles for the section of which runs clean and healthy again as we have recommended in what has been said.
And then we apply soaked wool in oil, and leave it on the wound; and we apply the bandage that we have recommended (for several veins have been cauterized white in this place where we feared excessive bleeding, which may happen because of these veins).  We leave the bandage in place until it falls off by itself
Even if the case is prolonged, however, cold water must be applied, and leave it on until it falls off as we have said.
And then care for the wound like any other wound until it is healed
Chapter 66
Of windy hernia
In this hernia nothing has been seen that has been omitted in its care.
And first say that it is useful as we have recommended in the hernia that is seen; that is to say, you tie the vessels close to the section above where it facilitates them; and then dry in the middle area around the tumor as much as possible until the vessels fall off
And care for the wound as we have said until it is healed
Chapter 67
Of the disorder that is useful for the joints
Several veins have burst in the joints as we have said, and examine the area
And do not cause excessive bleeding in the knee; and if there is any, it is little; return immediately in all cases
Even if the time is prolonged, however, adjust the fracture in the limb until the bleeding stops; and this happens because of the extension of the limb which is in the joints as we have said, which causes the limb to be extended, and therefore it is softened and the area is dehisced and examined
And the care for it is like that which precedes the narration of it
And every vein is cured with iron like this: the patient sits on the stool between your two legs, and then dry the area of the rupture of the bones examined with a section towards the outside according to the quantity of three fingers.
And then strengthen the white limb that is under the testicles until it is revealed
And then take the thread and leave it on the highest part of the limb, and hold that on the flank of the abdomen
And then suture the two highest parts on the extremity of the limb, and adjust with the suture one to the other
And then extract the limb from the artery, and do not insert any part of the limb, neither do not extend the bone, nor any other cause like I told you in the care of intestinal hernia
And then care for it like the care of wounds, and when you have incisions, soften that and restore the wound until it is consolidated; for the limb is contracted and the swelling is not adjusted
And it is better in this place, because it is more likely to be saved
Chapter 68
Of the softening of the testicles' cord
Many veins of the testicles' cord in several men are softened to help soften the flesh that is between them, and it is fed from it accordingly
When it is necessary for the one who is being treated to sit with his two legs apart, and he tears all the cord that is softened over the natural cord; and then that two lips are adjusted with the suture.
And if you wish, you can also ligate the excess of the softened cord with three stitches or four with a firm suture
And then penetrate between the sutures; and then care for the care of the other wounds until they are healed and the incisions fall off
Chapter 69
Of castration
Wisdom dictates that castration is forbidden in our law, however, I remember it in this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except for two instances, of which the one is that the physician should know how to care for it when asked about it, since he knows the care of it when it happens; and the other instance is that we must sometimes castrate other beasts for our young people for their pleasures, as well as mares, and sows, and goats, and pigs, and in the same way as beasts.
Therefore I say that castration is caused in two ways: either by extrusion or by incision at the root.
In the case of extrusion, the method of the operation is that we must cut off the beast in cold water until the testicles soften and become limp, and hang them down.</end_turn> And then take hold of them with your hand so that they do not appear to touch.</end_turn>
In castration caused by incision and section, because you must hold the beast and press the testicles with your left hand.</end_turn
And then join the supporters, and make an incision on each side of the belly with two incisions proceeding from the belly button.</end_turn
And then make the incisions when there is any swelling.</end_turn> Do not neglect any cause of swelling, but take for granted the subtle swelling that is on the vessels.</end_turn><end_turn>
And this method of castration is better than extrusion, because extrusion causes great swelling of the testicles, which would cause the beast to desire to bite.</end_turn><end_turn>
And take care of the wound until it has healed.</end_turn><end_turn>
Chapter LX.</end_turn>
Of the care of hermaphroditism.</end_turn>
Hermaphroditism in men is in two ways: when or if there is an opening in the belly of the testicles, in which there is a bulge like that of a woman in which there is a swelling between the testicles.</end_turn
And some women have a urinary bladder in the belly of the testicles.</end_turn
And in women it is a kind: and it is that the woman who has a penis like a man between the testicles has two testicles like a man, a little smaller than the normal testicles of a man.</end_turn
And the care is of three kinds: two of the men and one of the women.</end_turn And it is that you must cut away those fatty parts until the tumor is expelled, and that you take care of them with care like other wounds.</end_turn><end_turn
And in the second kind of the men of which there is a urinary bladder in the belly of the testicles, there is no care or operation for them.</end_turn
Chapter XXI.</end_turn
Of leech and ointment for the causes of women.</end_turn
The strong leech is applied to natural causes until it is relaxed and is used legally; and some women are plagued with it as much as in men and even during coitus.</end_turn><end_turn>
Therefore take hold of the excess of leech with your hand or with a sponge and apply it.</end_turn><end_turn
Do not hesitate to make an incision, especially in the groin, so that the blood does not clot.</end_turn><end_turn
And take care of that like with the care of wounds until it has healed.</end_turn><end_turn
And no new ointment is born except that which is in the horror of the mother until it fills that up, and the strong ointment is ejected to the parts like a sponge according to custom (and for this reason it is called "caudal disease"); therefore we must apply it just as we apply the leech, and care for that until it has healed.</end_turn><end_turn
Chapter LXII.</end_turn
Of the care of wound.</end_turn
A wound is when the woman does not have a hole, or has a small hole.</end_turn And it is either natural or accidental.</end_turn><end_turn
Accidental is for a disease that has preceded it, or that is caused by no adjustment of the flesh or by a subtle or thick wound.</end_turn><end_turn
And it is found in the groin, on the sides, on the navel, or on the buttocks, and prevents sweating, movement, and intercourse, and strong ointment prevents menstruation.</end_turn><end_turn
And the knowledge of that is useful for the regulation of the womb, if the swelling is apparent, it is necessary; but if it is not apparent, when you touch that area you will feel it.</end_turn><end_turn
The patient is experiencing pain in various parts of the body, likely due to cold humors. The physician suggests that this is likely gout. If necessary, the physician instructs the assistant to make small incisions on the foot's surface using a pointed cautery. Additionally, the physician advises reducing any swelling or blisters and placing a hand over the area to prevent any internal organs from protruding.
When the thighs are powdered with flour, and the assistant indicates that the bowels are full, then it is a sign of imminent discharge.
The female should sit on the two hips, the cushions should be spread out, and extend the thighs with force until the subtle swelling has burst and the swelling has opened
And take some wool and soak it in oil, place that over the area, and hold that there for so long as the area does not solidify
If the swelling is large and thick, then cover that with some thick fat or a sprig of myrtle leaf
If the swelling is bloody, then suspend that for a while, and make an incision there.
And give the patient the medicines that stop the flow of blood that causes swelling, such as vinegar, alum, and saffron, adjusted with oil of hyssop
And give a wide needle of lead so that the wound does not solidify too much.
Keep that for four days and give a dry gauze
And take care of it with the other care of consolidation until it is healed
Whenever such things happen in the greater part of the birth of other parts, and the physician has observed in this manner. If there is an afterbirth of bones, do not make it contrary to the force in any way.

On the care of haemorrhoids, piles and red swelling that happen in the belly of women.
Haemorrhoids are appreciated from the veins of the buttocks rather than from those that carry blood continuously; and when they are ancient haemorrhoids and are made by the tears.
And I have already said in the division of those things that I mentioned before, and I say that those that receive care and those that do not receive care
Therefore I say that haemorrhoids and piles when they are in the belly and do not show any sign, do not require any treatment
However, those that are in the opening of the belly about which there is a sensation, are those that must be treated
And you must put the woman in more heat and loosen the thighs with the forceps, or with rough wool, and make incisions there with the roots
And sprinkle over those there must flow the blood of one of the veins that is bleeding from the incisions, just like vinegar and like blood clot
And put the lower limbs in hot water for an hour, and then stop that in cold water
And if the bleeding persists, that is to say that there is decoction of blood and of blackheads and of pus and of humours.
And give barley food and comfort that has honey and vinegar and make a plaster with water over the two of them
And if the blood is evacuated, well; but if not, make her adhere to two cushions, and to the breasts there is sacrifice
And give wool and soak it in the juice of marjoram or in the juice of arnica or in the juice of aloe with a little wine and make her adhere to the area; and take care of the area until it is healed
Take care of that until it is healed

On the perforation of an abscess that happens in the belly
There are various species of abscesses that happen in the belly, such as carbuncles, abscesses that arise from boils and ulcers, abscesses filled with pus and blood clots, and hernias, fistula of haemorrhoids, boils and other abscesses And I have already spoken about these diseases, their kinds, their symptoms, and their treatments in the division.
And I say in this treatise that the most common cause of gout is excessive cold, which, when it infects all parts of the body, causes pain in the feet. And if you wish to know how this operation is performed, I shall tell you.</end_turn>
Therefore, if you consider that the sudden pain of gout in the heel begins with percussion, swelling, and fever, and sometimes when it engulfs and if you prick about that feeling, do not perforate it; rather do what helps to mature it until the acute symptoms cease.</end_turn
Therefore, make an incision over a callous that has two callous; recline on the heel two and adjust the lower legs to the part beyond the belly, and the lower buttocks will be spread out, and place your hands over the belly so that the intestine does not come out.</end_turn
And then follow the midwife closely with the flank that is to be opened and administer the instrument with which the opening of the greater part will be made, the form of which will come in those causes that make it necessary.</end_turn
And when you are going to administer this instrument, stay close to the edge of the greater part of the foot, and what comes out of the instrument into the greater part should not be more than the edge of the greater part and cause pain.</end_turn If the instrument is larger than the edge of the greater part, then pause powder on the texture of the edge of the greater part so that no other instrument can penetrate the edge of the greater part.</end_turn
And that you pause the tremor that runs in the instrument of the flank as soon as it is detached and that the minister hold the instrument and rotate the tremor until the opening of the greater part is made.</end_turn
And when the evacuation comes, which is touched with the hand and is yellow and bloody, then you should stop it by pressing on it with the thumb of your hand.</end_turn
And when the healing is evacuated, then you should place in the wound a soaked sponge in olive oil or green oil in which there is any spasm; and keep the heel still in the section of the greater part of the foot.</end_turn
And keep the greater part covered and over the wound a clean cloth soaked in water in which there are boiled mallows.</end_turn
And keep the wound clean for two days until the swelling has gone down.
And every day the foot and the wound should be washed with water and salt, and should be covered with water in which lilies or long-haired violets are boiled, and then return to the wound.</end_turn
If the wound becomes infected in the foot, then you should be prohibited from treating it with fire, following the treatment that has been mentioned in the division.</end_turn
End of treatise.</end_turn>
To teach the midwives in what manner they should administer these remedies when necessary according to figures that are not natural.</end_turn
There is a necessary reason because the midwife at the beginning knows the natural figure of childbirth by its signs, and that when the woman goes into labor and wants to smell the air, and when this happens there is an expulsion from the parts below and she wants to vomit, the hour is that this part is in a natural figure, and that is the expulsion of the head, and the second one is that of the navel or suspension or pendency.</end_turn
Therefore, when you see these signs, you must compress the belly so that the embryo comes down slightly from the head, and this is accompanied by the vomiting of those superfluities with good monitoring.</end_turn
For example, when the embryo comes down onto its feet and the body of the fetus comes forward over the head of the fetus, and the foot or the hand, that is, or the head and the hand are ejected, or the head is ejected over the belly, and such things are contrary to the natural figures.</end_turn
It is necessary for the midwife to be skilled and prudent in all these cases, and to guard against error and deception.</end_turn
And I have shown you all the figures of these things, and what is their meaning for these things so that you know what they are and what is not.</end_turn
When the male seed escapes through the natural orifice of the semen, and that which is vehement upon the thigh is done to it which is difficult, and sometimes the art itself is already weakened, then it is customary to say that the woman has the power, or that the thighs have power, and it vaporizes with the smoke of cinnamon and with the smell of warm hum.
And immediately insert the metronome between the thighs said above, put a little sponge there and make a hole at that point, or cut off that which is in it of humidity. And press the belly of the woman until it descends the fetus.
Maybe if it does not descend, the hour covers that the woman be covered with mucus of peas and mucus of cinnamon at the edges
And immediately command her, immediately cry, that she be compressed and make that she vomit at convenience; and close her mouth and nose for an hour, so that the fetus may be forgotten as much as possible
And if two-thirds of the fetus have already forgotten at the beginning, the hour covers that you reduce them little by little Maybe if it does not obey the order, the hour pauses the woman over a cushion and lifts her feet up, and immediately put a cushion under her; and the woman be held that she does not fall from the cushion
And if the greatest part is not returned and the fetus dies, the hour incites those and extracts the fetus or ties his body to her hand and extracts that which is equal, so that that which is forgotten may be forgotten
When the fetus comes down to the feet of the legs, the hour covers that you press those against his belly, and immediately make the fetus small, and immediately cause him to vomit, and immediately take hold of one foot and stretch those little by little.
And when they are within the space, the hour commands her to groan, and make her vomit at convenience, for if God wills it, that which is forgotten will be forgotten
And if it is not forgotten in what we have recounted, the hour returns the fetus little by little until it pauses at that second natural figure, for that which is forgotten in that will be forgotten at that time.
And if it is prohibited in all that we have recounted, the hour takes from high mucus and dissolved gum, and pierce all over the foot for good percussion, and immediately place on that which is in the belly of the woman, the fluid from the belly of the woman. And immediately make that incision in water, until you have completed the hypocondria.
And sometimes when the parts have become softened, the hour makes them undergo fumigation of myrtle and suspends that for them.<end_turn> And when the fumigation has lasted for an hour, the hour makes her lie on a cushion, and immediately make her vomit and pull out her mouth, and take from her that which is below, and press the lower part of her belly with her hand, so that the fetus may be forgotten as much as possible.<end_turn>
Thus from this time of the fetus while one of her things hangs out laterally. So order to reduce her hand, even if you cannot reduce it, the hour raises the woman and commands her to go away.</start_turn>
And if she goes away cannot, the hour makes her lie on her side, and with her thighs clenched with violent percussion, and immediately administer to her those which you gave and recommended of mucilages.
If it is urgent, do that which is necessary to save the limb, and study carefully the reduction of the hand, and bind the foot according to its natural figure, and make the woman vomit and command her to keep her bowels closed until the pain has subsided.
Indeed, when the foot is swollen and its flesh is doubled in size, its pain is doubled as well When the mistress has grasped the foot and gently rolls it back and forth, and while doing so facilitates the procedure
And when it is well-bound and the hand is relaxed, then pause for a moment over the bones of the foot where we have recommended oil and unguents
And command them to move their hand slowly, and when they are finished, do that which is necessary to cause the limb to return to its natural position and command her to lean slightly forward, and command her to compress it; and make her vomit again. The fetus is ready for birth on the broad side
When they desire to terrify the mother according to this manner, consider it, and do not hesitate to cut the second nail until it is evacuated of humidity
If the foot is suspended over the face and the heel, then cut that of the embolism, so that it is not retained and remains
And immediately place the foot on the cushion until it pauses again, and command the woman to compress herself with several vegatables, and the sirrah will depart immediately without further ado, if God wills or no
The childbirth of twins or many fetuses is an arduous labor. The wise ones say that when twins are born together with their afterbirth, three or four of them are born at once, which is strange and difficult; for such things are not usual in nature, and they do not live long
And tell of those who have been multiplied, whether one after the other, and who are separated by the umbilical cord, distinguish those that remain in the navel cord of the afterbirth of those that have been delivered. For each of these vegatables is delivered as if it were a fetus naturally, and so there remain some vegatables which, as we have recommended, are not edible at all
And if they are difficult to deliver, you must do that which we have said of the unnatural figures, and take care of those as we have recounted.
And if the mistress is cunning and does what is necessary to make it easier and quieter, and to expedite matters, and is ingenious according to all figures as she has been prepared for the imminent danger to health
Remember that she who forms in the womb from embryos and aborts
Some veins are formed in the major one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight. And indeed I must verify that a woman who has had six fetuses has suffered from this, and another has had ten altogether, which causes great pain according to the measure of the wise men
And all this must be known by the skill of the mistress that she is strong in that part which resembles that of that which is known to her, and therefore she must command that it be stopped when she knows it must be stopped
Chapter 166
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you are treating a dead fetus, in accordance with what has been said in the division of medicine, and it is not urgent, and you must use an operation with a hand, cover that the woman is of sound virtue and is not likely to suffer from the accidents for which she is feared to be at risk.
Cover that the woman is covered over her thighs and is leaning forward with her head inclined towards her knees and her thighs elevated
And the assistant has a hold of two parts or is bound in the thigh for so that the body does not extend beyond the extraction of the fetus
And moisten the mouth of the mistress with oil, warm mucus of high quality and fennel seeds and sesame seeds.
And put a little oil and mucus on the mistress’ hand, and with your other hand interlace your hand in the hand of the fetus, and seek the hand in which the nails remain in the fetus
E locs convenient in aquo: adonc tu considera si le fet est preparat que deysenda super le sieu cap, et lahoras tu residas les uncis in les vulves de lu, in le coll, in la boca, in le palatum, dejos la barba, in la furcula de lu, in les locs propdas de las costas, dejos les ypocondres.
In such a case you must consider whether the patient is prepared for this: if the nails are to be cut on the toes, in the heel, in the mouth, on the palate, or you leave the beard, or the tonsils, or in the proper places of the back, or you leave the testicles.
And that you must have the thumb with your left hand, and stop the curvature of the limb at that place which is between the fingers of your left hand, and enter your right hand at ease and keep the thumb in some of those places which we have mentioned until the cause of the pain has passed away.
And thus pause and remain in the position of the limb another thumb, or the third if necessary, so that there is an equal traction, and not only an extension according to its rectitude
And thus be cautious throughout, so that the sensation of the limb is relieved as much as possible, just as it is done in teeth for the extirpation of the tooth
And thus do in them what is between them that the extension be softened; and if any part of the limb is retained, then cover that the midwife put some fat on the tip of the thumb and enter those expected and rotate over those that are retained.
Therefore if the part of the limb is dislocated, then you must exchange the nails among those that are more convenient; and do this until the whole limb is dislocated
And if the hand is bleeding profusely before the other, and it is not possible to reduce that due to the stiffness of the limb, then cover that with a bandage; and extract that until all is dislocated, and insert that or that at the wrist or in the elbow
And thus do with the other hand and the two feet.
And if the head of the limb is large, or if it has become stiff in the sensation, or if there is too much water adjusted in the head, then enter between the teeth some coarse sponges and open the head and extract the water, or that you break that with an instrument which is called “alundat”, the shape of which will be like that of the other instruments in the capital which is similar to this
And thus do if the limb is of great head by nature: and that you insert that with an instrument, or that you support that with an instrument as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps
And if the head is burst and is stiffened by the tonsils, then cut until the humidity which is in the feet is drained out<end_turn>
And if it is not complicated, or if it does not obey to this sensation, then you must cut the head as much as possible as you are able.
And if the belly is swollen or is in hydrops, then you must pierce that until the humidity which is in it is drained out<end_turn
And if the limb is on the thighs, then the traction of the limb is slight and the direction of the limb towards the mouth of the mother is slight<end_turn>
And if it is stiff from the belly to the feet, then you must extract that which has been wrapped around your hand, and open the belly and the feet until the water that is in them has drained out<end_turn
And if the other members are at rest and you return the head, then the midwife enters the left hand; but if the mouth of the mother is open, then enter the hand into the armpit, and close that over the head, and pull that towards the mouth of the mother, and enter one or two nails into that.
And if the mouth of the mother is closed by a cautery that has happened to her, then do not make it swell over that; simply provide that you administer an ointment of fatty humors. Give compresses; and follow the patient with waters that soften and moisten.
And if the limb is on the thigh coast, then if possible is to make an incision: and to administer what we have said concerning the limb alive.
And if that is not possible, then make an incision in parts, and extract that.<end_turn>
And do not leave any cause of pain from the second time.<end_turn>
And when you have completed all of your work, then administer what we have said of the treatment in the aftercare, which is what happens in the greatest degree.
If blood flows excessively, then discharge in cold water and administer the other treatment.</end_of_turn>
I have already seen a woman in the belly of whom was dead, and I immediately took hold of another leech from her, and immediately the other died.</end_of_turn It happens often that after a long time of posturing on the abdomen in the belly; and when one opens up, the body begins to swell, and vomiting ensues.</end_of_turn
And I was called to care for them, and I treated them for a long time, but the plague did not subside.</end_of_turn
Then I stopped dealing with them for some reason of great attraction, and I cast out one bone, and I passed by several days, and I cast out another bone; and I was amazed that in the belly there was no bone.</end_of_turn
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead.</end_of_turn>
Therefore I again treated the plague, and I extracted from them four bones, the woman existing in the thousand disposals of the thighs, and already for a long time I had seen her in such a way, corrected her with a little vomit.</end_of_turn>
And I did not doubt but that it was science and an assistant to that which the doctor artificially put in his hand for treatment.</end_of_turn
Concerning the forms of instruments that are necessary to extract the bone.</end_of_turn
A form of vertigo with which the greatest part is opened.</end_of_turn
This is the form of tweezers in which two handles are grasped, to which two vertigos are attached at the ends of two thumbs.</end_of_turn May this vertigos cover that it is more subtle than the strictor, and be made of iron or of lead or of glass.</end_of_turn
And the breadth of each tube is as much as two fingers and the margin from each side is as much as one finger, and the length is one palm and a half; and in the middle of two tubes there are two adjustments of that middle tube which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the breadth is as much as two fingers, or a little more.</end_of_turn
And these two additional things are introduced into the mouth of the greatest part so that it is opened with those two vertigos which you rotate.</end_of_turn
Another form similar to that which is more subtle and lighter.</end_of_turn
Made of iron or lead or glass according to the shape of forceps.</end_of_turn And indeed at the end of these there are two such additional things which are sometimes added, and the length of those additional things is as much as one palm, and the breadth is two fingers.</end_of_turn
And when you want to open the greatest part, then do make the woman lie on her side with her feet hanging down, open what is between the thighs of her.</end_of_turn And then open your hand with the instrument as if you were grasping forceps according to the amount you wish of the opening of the greatest part until the metronome makes you.</end_of_turn
The form of vertigo which they formerly said.</end_of_turn
The form of pushing with which the bone is pushed out.</end_of_turn
The form of friendship in which the head is contained.</end_of_turn
And it is assembled like forceps to which teeth are added at the end, as sometimes, and sometimes the veins are made with such a form like forceps, as sometimes, to which teeth are added just like teeth of a saw with which is inscribed and contains.</end> Simple form.</end_of_turn
Form of a hook having a spine.</end_of_turn
Form of a hook having two spines.</end_of_turn
The limbs are affected by the scald, and the head is cut off:
Two spatums are formed, each with a head cut off.
All these instruments are exercises, and when their number is multiplied and their qualities are prepared, then the artificer must be quick in his work and take more care of his work than of their quantity.
And do not work with these instruments either, for their need is not excusable
From the extraction of the second [tooth].
When the second [tooth] is retained, you must encourage the patient to cough forcefully, and then give the patient something to spit out, and strengthen your hand over the patient's mouth and nose, and if by chance it comes out, do not be afraid
Or if so, take an egg and pierce a hole in the membrane and put it on those herbs that open the mouth of the patient, thus with warmth and speed and alum and chamomile and saffron and mastic and cassia lignea and holy thistle. All these herbs or some of them are immersed in water in the egg, and put that over the fire
And then insert a tube of canewater into the patient's mouth, and keep it there until the vapor comes out to the bottom of the mouth
And then make the patient cough as we have said, and the second [tooth] will come out quickly
But if it remains close, order the nurse to immerse your left hand in olive oil or in a mixture of alum, and then insert that into the gums around the tooth and loosen it with that. When the tooth is loosened, take hold of it and extract it little by little so that the gum does not suffer excessive bleeding. And keep the patient relaxed on both sides and quiet.
If the patient's mouth is bleeding excessively, we have already recommended the treatment with coughing and the egg with herbs
But if it does not come out despite all the causes we have recommended, then keep in mind that what comes out of the tooth into the mouth is the pus, and strengthen that with ointment and tetracycline; for that will make it easier for the pus to go away in a few days and disappear completely and come out without causing harm to the gum
When pus becomes putrid, it emits a bad odor from the head and the stomach, which makes the patient suffer; and therefore it is necessary to administer sub-fumiguous and convenient medications at this time.
Indeed, the ancients already knew sub-fumigation with lead and dry figs.
The form of the instrument with which the female is sub-fumigated is due to the retention of menstruation and the second [tooth].
Whether by sight or by hearing.
And keep the root of the tooth grasped in the gums and the wide part over the fire, and the sub-fumigation over the sleeves of the fire.
And keep that until the sub-fumigation is consumed and repeat it again
Care for the buttocks of the unperforated child<end_turn>
The children groan and their buttocks are already soft and swollen from the previous treatment.<end_turn> Therefore order the nurse to pierce the tooth as we have said; and if not, pierce with the spatula, and take care not to touch the nerve.<end_turn
Then place some fat-soaked wool on the vinegar and oil; and keep that on until it is dry.<end_turn
But if you fear that it is swollen, take out the egg for a few days, and keep it out until the child stops groaning.<end_turn
And if the buttocks have already swollen from consolidation of pus or swelling; then that consolidation must be softened, and care must be taken with the water that we mentioned in the treatment and the plum.<end_turn
From the care of fistulas that arise from the joints.
The fistulas that arise in the lower limbs are noticeable and numerous, which arise from the groin or in the space of the buttock.
And it is a fistula or swelling.
And when that swelling is old and corrupted by excessive wetness of white or pale color, and some veins are seen to penetrate these fistulas, some penetrate.
And those that penetrate are known as those that arise from the evacuation and wind; and some veins use the patient's evacuation, and they are often ejected from those veins.
And from these fistulas some veins penetrate into the bladder, and into the meat of the heel; and some penetrate into the joint of the thigh and into the root of the buttock.
And that in which the penetrating fistula is known to enter the groin and not penetrate, is that you must tell the patient that it is in the groin, and when you do not penetrate with the thumb or with the finger in the fistula, it is swelling.
May be if it is swelling, when you enter with your thumb or with the finger into that swelling that you sit on the thumb or put your finger on the index.
And if you do not sit on that one or if you do not find any cause of evacuation or bleeding or wind, as we have said, then it is known that it is not penetrating, and you are to be content with the care.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meat of the heel, the meaning of it is that it is a fistula of urine and that you must prohibit it from going out until the area is healed by medicine.
May be if it penetrates into the joint or into the bone and bruising of pain in the limb, the meaning of it is that the thumb has penetrated here if not swelling into the bone, and bruising of pain in the limb of the lower part; and that from this it is reduced in all its parts; and that it is of no use in this medicine, neither is it consolidated at once.
And in all those penetrating fistulas, it is not a cure for everything, and the cure for those is the work and uselessness of the doctors concerning which they have been forbidden.
But in that one which is not penetrating and is not old, healing with iron is expected as I shall tell you, and that which I have already done and practiced
And that the patient lies between your thighs and raises the legs within their limits, the thighs are inclined towards the belly of the patient, and you approach and insert your thumb, or if it is in the fistula swelling, put your thumb in place.
And if that sitting gives the patient pain in the groin, then you must tell the patient that it is in the groin
And if you sit on the index finger the thumb has already penetrated by itself without revealing it, or that if you sit between the index finger and that hip or thigh, then it is certainly that it is penetrating; and do not work in that one, for that is not in this healing, as we have said
But indeed I say that it is well in many homes today.
And concerning the medicine for which healing is expected together in them is that you light the pointed cautery with a moderate flame according to the extent of the fistula, as it is previously stated, and you insert that ignited flame into the fistula until it reaches the groin; and approach doing it twice or three times until you see that all those meats affected by the fistula that seem like feathers of a sparrow are already adjusted
And approach care that is wrapped in borders so that all those meats that are adjusted are covered, and approach care that is generated by medicines that produce and consolidate, and if it is healed, good; but if not, it is not healed by any other treatment.
And if the thumb enters and does not penetrate into the index finger which is in the groin, and between that one and the thumb which is very sensitive to meat or fat, and sometimes the fistula penetrates the surface of the heel, then it is necessary to dry the heel from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it dry on the thumb, and it is freed from the fistula as soon as the excision reaches the place where the extremity of the thumb was, and for the thumb is freed and released
And approach making smooth those meats affected by the fistula which seem like feathers of a sparrow and do not remain from any cause
But if pus sometimes comes out between you and your operation when you are burning those meats, then it is better that you burn with fire or acute medicine, because the cautery with fire adjusts well good things: it is an adjustment of those meats that are adjusted, and excision of the pus of the excessive humidity.
E aprop cura aquela am calguas envolopadas en boder o en caus trissat entro que·l loc geta brac, e aprop lahoras cura la plagua am enguentz carn dura engendran e consolidan.

Emorroydas so segon dos manieyras, quar o so entre le cul semblantz aysi que es de carbos, o quays aquelas sian cum a gras de rasim E de aquelas so petitas e grans, e que le sanc corr de aquelas tostemps e es una, e so motas, e so fora·l cul, e en las extremitatz de lu
Mays empero aquelas que so foro le cul so segon las mes de pauca humiditat, de las quals corr aygua citrina o un petit de sanc am cos continuabla, e so segon la color del cos.
E la curacio de aquela que es dedintz le cuol es que comandes al malaute que se assela e que se exprema entro que le cuol yesca e las emoroydas apparescan a tu. Adonc tu te coyte e suspen am uncis o que tenguas aquelas am la tua ungla, e aprop incideys aquelas deves las suas razitz.
May be if those nails do not have their hardness because of the humidity of those, then take them at a rough or coarse or flabby state of wool, and extract them from the teeth, and then plunge them into the wound and sprinkle over them some fine ashes nearby the incision; or cauterize them as it is said beforehand in the chapter of cautery. And do the other care for the other care until they are healed
And if the limb does not obey evacuation, then crush the patient in the place where there is little biting, and wash it in the water that is in the bowl and let it evacuate willingly when the patient is discharged
However if the boils are outside the limb, the cause of them is slight, and it is that you take them off with your nail, or that you take them off with forceps, and instill them, and then care for them with the water that has been said until they are healed.
And whoever makes an incision, cover that he gives stitches of it in this manner: take thread that has a knot at one end and enter that through a needle and then extract the boils from the parts above, and make that penetrate through the needle in the root of the other part, and surround the two ends of the thread that are outside the needle with the part that is beyond the needle, and stretch them longitudinally; and stretch the boil with a strong structure, and then hold the thread firmly and extract the needle.
And do all this, and leave them out of the wound a little and do not close them, so that the excess of the healing may flow from that.
And put on the limb a soft dressing soaked in olive oil or in grease; and put that on the wound and command the patient to rest. And leave it until the box is gone; and when it is gone, care for them with ointment or another care until they are healed
And since they are ancient and are not of use in that medicine, when you see that they are useful, that is when they are wet and host the pus that comes out of them, which hinders their consolidation; and care for them until they are consolidated.<end_turn
Then keep them moist at a greater ratio than the first time until the wound is healed and is scabbed over; and care for them until they are healed.<end_turn
Be aware that the ulcer is painful, that is key, and that you must note red around according to the color of the flesh resembling the head of a nail, and that is useful in all parts of the body and especially in the lower parts of the feet and the toes, and because of those pains you must support it.<end_turn
And so you must cover that which is in the circumference of the nail, and hold it with forceps or with a forceps, and extirpate it from its root; and care for that.<end_turn
Or if you wish, cauterize them as it is said beforehand in the chapter on cautery.<end_turn
However if a boil is a small elevation rough and round about the surface of the body, and drops of pus are seen in the most of children.
And the care for them is to stretch and instill it, or to open it with thread or hair until it is gone.<end_turn> Or if you wish, cauterize them as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.<end_turn
However a formica is a small foul-smelling elevation or large fistula about the surface of the body when it is felt there is an ant in it resembling the biting of an ant, and that is useful around the body.<end_turn
And the care for them is to take a needle of fine awl or a needle of spool, and be strong, and place that over the ant until it is contained by the circle of the needle in the parts around it; and then twist your hand over the needle until you instill the water that is in the circumference of the ant, and stop that on the wound of the flesh, and evacuate the ant from its root.<end_turn
Or if you wish, do the same with a needle of horn or of iron according to this fashion:
The needle has been withdrawn from the wound, leaving the opening closed. The surrounding area is enveloped to prevent the edges from coming into contact and causing further pain.
If you wish to cauterize the area, do so as described previously in the chapter on cautery.</end_of_turn>
In the same way as the instruments are administered to give comfort.</end_of_turn>
Some drugs are useful for providing comfort, such as gold, lead, tin or mercury; others are administered with small or large instruments depending on the nature of the ailment, for those administered for the care of young children should be small; and for those whose buttocks are sore or painful, the dose should be small.</end_of_turn
The way to provide comfort for the great and the few.</end_of_turn
The head of the needle from which the bag is suspended is wide according to this manner; and there should be a distinction between the place where the bag is attached in this way as often.</end_of_turn
And the lower part of the limb which is inside the buttock is closed (so it is not perforated) like a lion, backwards towards the skin; and on one side of the limb there are two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, with a smaller one for the greater.</end_of_turn
And the bag in which the medicines from the bladder of an animal or from the skin of a sheep are held, and the size of it is a palm.</end_of_turn
And it is pierced by means of four holes like this when it is rotated; and if the space between the holes is the thickness of the finger.</end_of_turn
And so insert into those holes firmly with thread of twelve threads, or more; and adjust as you wish the bag; and when it is suspended in it the bag should be stretched in the head of the wound between two distinct things with strong constriction, and slightly cauterize at each hole: The quality of cauterizing which is best is that you fill the bag with medicine, which should be warmed according to the quantity of the patient’s tolerance; and take care that it is not too cold or too hot.</end_of_turn
And so the patient should be placed lying down on the seat, and elevate their limbs on their thighs and stop them there with a cushion or a blanket; and apply oil or albumin of oil or mucilage of fenugreek or of chamomile to the limb; and insert that into the buttock with ease, and the minister should grasp the bag and express it until two more and three drops have escaped into the bowel until it is evacuated from the wound; and then remove the needle and the patient takes back their limbs to the side.</end_of_turn>
And if the medicine forces this to happen, hold it as much as you can; and if you sleep with it for the whole night, it is better in the morning.</end_of_turn
Better if you cauterize that in the abdominal diseases and the swelling subsides, then you repeat the cautery until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if in the buttock there are emboldened or bloodstained spots, then the needle should be closed like a lion, like the needle which is used for children.</end_of_turn
Care of wounds.</end_of_turn>
I have already said in the division of the care of wounds that which is most suitable for the free man, and I say the same concerning the care of those with hands and medicines according to the complement.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that wounds are diverse according to the cause of the wound and the location of the wound.</end_of_turn
And the causes by which most wounds are caused are various, such as a wound from a stone, or incision of space or bone, or percussion with the fist, or with a whip, or with an arrow, or like those of these causes.</end_of_turn
And the wounds that are in the places of the body are also like a wound that occurs on the head, or the shoulder, or the foot, or the belly, or the genitals, or like those of the limbs.</end_of_turn
And I recommend the care of some wounds so that they stop that ratiocination and rule concerning the others.</end>
And I will begin with the simple head wounds, for the memory of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.</end>
Therefore I say that when there is a simple head wound and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is from a stone or something similar, and if it has already bled alone and is a large wound, and you fear that there will be a fistula, cover the wound and apply the plaster of Paris immediately; do not delay until later; and extract according to the quantity of the virtue of the plaster if there is no other cause that prohibits its application, especially if the wound is small.
The pain of the joints is caused by cold humors which infiltrate all the parts of the body; and when the pain is in the feet, the doctors usually call it gout.
Even if the cause is slight, do not allow any indulgence, for the hour should be diminished from the wine and do not approach meat or wine.
And rest on the plague, if it should happen that after the cautery some pus comes out, soak it in olive oil or in wine where it is stipped.
Even if you are certain that the cautery is finished, rest on the plague, if it is recent and the air is still clean and the powder which I recommended is still there.
And if the air has already changed, rest on the abscess until it is healed
Even if the abscess is great or is for lack of space and for the swelling, and the lips of the wound are not adjusted for pupils, the hour adjusts those by suture as I recommend for the suture of them
Even if the abscess is already exposed from the bone and skin, and is not retained but for a slight swelling, the hour incisions that and immediately care for the abscess with medicines and restore the limb immediately in its place instead of codena, and command the patient to abstain from eating coarse food: heads and brains, kidneys and fat, until it is digested.
And if in the codena there is decay and it does not adhere to the bone, the hour incisions all that is putrefying and removes it, and immediately care for it
Even if in these abscesses there is an artery or vein from which blood flows of a clean nature that does not require excision by medicines, the hour inquires about the artery, and if you find that it is not incised, the hour incisions it with a sponge or ligature; and if necessary you must provoke that which we have said must not be eaten, the hour cauterizes until the blood is evacuated.
And if these abscesses are simple and small, the cause of them is slight; even if you powder over those very powders, which solidify when the air changes those.
And the manner of the powder is this: take part olive oil, two parts blood of a virgin, three parts non-extinct alum, mix them all together and grind them, and let the abscess be full of them, and keep it compressed by good constriction until it sticks to the wound, and let it coagulate with the blood.</end_turn>
And immediately strengthen that which comes out with the powders and read that, and do not remove it while it is still moist, because it is not driven out by medicine until it is healed.</end_turn>
And every time that you do this alone, when I am not in your presence oil and blood of a virgin.
And I have already performed this operation in great abscesses when you considered that it should be delayed over those and that they are stretched, and only in recent abscesses where their blood has not been altered.</end_turn
And if their blood has been altered, and especially when it is in summer, the hour does not understand the position of this powder, however, I advise that you care for those with water which we have said, or that you care for those with barley flour and water until the swelling goes down; and immediately care for them with the other care until they are healed.</end_turn
Even if in the abscess there is a fracture in the bone, and it is small, the hour extracts that with the hand.
And I say the care of the fractures of the head in that which is venomous.</end_turn
Of the abscesses of the knee.
Even if the abscess occurs in the knee, the hour is no different in its treatment, and between the abscess of the head when it is simple.</end_turn><end_turn>
Even if the nerves of the knee are incised or an artery, the hour if it is a nerve, it is not in its engineering but that it is avoided care of them with water which makes gentle stypticity, as with vinegar and celery which is old and resembles them because it does not touch the nerves and relaxes that.</end_turn><end_turn> And do not rest over any cause of all coolness, for the substance of the nerves is cold and the continuation of them is at the brain, which is the most important of all the members.</end_turn><end_turn
If it appears that the ailment is not curable by medicines, thus when the cause is washed out by water, every vegetable matter infused in olive oil, roasted or unroasted, and then when washed out by water again and the other small stones are removed according to this manner, and humi is added.
If the plague is great, then administer sutures, or bind the edges of the wound, and indeed cure that which is within with powders until it is healed.
If the plague is deep or accidental at the lower part, then pierce that in the area most depressed
If in the plague the artery has already been cut and the blood flow has become healthy, then separate or dry that, or ligate that, or cauterize that if necessary to prevent further bleeding.
If the spondylitis of the groin has already been incised and all, and the veins of the thigh have been preserved, then you adjust the edges of the wound with sutures over the thigh of the groin and do not touch that; elevate that and reduce that to its natural figure, and strengthen that which is stretched downwards, and rest that for several days; and indeed cure that which is infected with swelling and inflammation until it is healed
If the plague has already affected the bones in price, then pierce that, and if there are fragments of bone, extract all of those that you can from it; and what remains, rest that until the plague has subsided, and be separate and relieved of it
And if the plague is recent, then sprinkle on that powder which has been recommended to you. If in the plague there is a fistula, then cure that with water from which the memory will soon be taken away in the head
If it is percussion of the thigh or of the hip, and sometimes of the depth of the wound, then consider more if it is the plague which has been produced by excessive heat; the doctor must know that the plague is deadly
And if in it there is not depth and the plague is recent at the surface of the limb, then you wait in it for the first hour to sprinkle, and do not strengthen that lest it be retained in the depth of the wound and return to the head and cause the disease to worsen; rather wait in it until it is attracted, and loosen that two vegetables a day.</start_of_turn>
And if the vomit is not at your present, then you wait in the orifice of the plague until it is cold because of the moisture; and make the patient sleep over the plague so that it runs out what is in it adjusted.
If already of the plague more than three days have passed or more, and no spasm or tremor of the limb or bad stiffness results from it, and sometimes the other good symptoms of it, then indeed the plague is saved; and indeed cure that which is cold and the other cure until it is healed.
If the recovery from it is excused, and already all the time is open, then indeed the fistula is already finished; cure therefore that for the head of the limb.
And if the plague is by incision of space or hip, and is simple on the surface of the foot or of the thigh, then cure that with water which precedes the suture, if it is great, or with powder if it is small.</start_of_turn>
If already in the bones there has been price, and so already has been cut pieces, then you extract the plague and cover to extract those pieces, if they are separated.</start_of_turn> If they are not separated, then rest until the plague has subsided, for the extraction of them is alleviated.</start_of_turn
And as for the other plagues that happen in the other members, the help in their cure is the help of the water that has been said.</start_of_turn
Of the belly plagues.</start_of_turn
The indisposition which happens in the belly is either great, or little, or mild.</start_of_turn
And a slight wound is difficult for another way, and if you do not protect yourself from the introduction of them into the limb as much as possible, it swells and becomes difficult because the instrument of them is already finished.</start_of_turn
Therefore the best disruption is milder, for in that case the reduction of the intestine is easier, just as it is in the two preceding species mentioned.
You are right, the next sentence is:
Two other sutures are sufficient for the other wounds, but in the case of the intestine suture these are usually the most proper
I recommend that you take care of any exposed parts and declare them
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and there is no cause for the hernia to exist, and when it is difficult to reduce it, the hour is in two ways: either because of the smallness of the disruption as we have said, or because the hernia is caused by cold air.
Therefore when it is like this, the hour is that you cover that area with a sponge moistened with warm water, or that you soak with vinegar, saffron, pepper, and cloves until the inflammation has subsided
Some herbs make the water in which they have been steeped more effective for the reduction of inflammation. It is better than plain water for resolving the inflammation.</start_of_turn>
Therefore when the inflammation has subsided, the hour is to moisten the hernia with warm water in which salt and mallow have been soaked, because this alleviates the pain of the intestine due to little cause.</start_of_turn>
However, if the intestine has been freed from the adhesion, this treatment should be omitted. The hour is to cut the disruption with a small instrument that has been soaked in lard, which will leave no scars.</start_of_turn>
The first treatment is better when it is appropriate, that is, without being excessive, and does not require excessive drying.
Then describe the instrument in shape.</start_of_turn
One part is sharp, the other is not, and the handle is thick, not blunt, with a slightly obtuse tip.</start_of_turn
Therefore when the wound is large and the hernia is coming out, the hour is to reduce it according to its natural shape, in its proper place, if possible over the intestine, because that is better.</start_of_turn
Moreover when the disruption is wide and is in the lower part of the abdomen, the hour is to place the patient on their side, and to suspend their legs higher than the chest; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, the hour is to suspend the chest and the legs more than the lower parts.</start_of_turn
Similarly, if the disruption is on one side of the abdomen, the hour is to stop your attention and your thoughts for a moment so that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other.</start_of_turn
And also that you administer water in the large wounds and in the smaller wounds.</start_of_turn
In the small wounds, stop the water that you have prepared and give it between your greatest wounds, which have the whole disruption in their hand and adjust their lips, and take away from that which if necessary causes another suture.</start_of_turn
This is the common suture technique: you grasp the needle or the needle handle according to the width of the wound; and you leave the tip of the disruption from the ring finger, and you tighten the needle one or two times so that you do not leave the knot at the bottom of the wound, between the two extremities of the codena, until you have pierced through that part; and you have already added two extremities of the codena and two extremities of the ciphac, and so there are four in total.</start_of_turn
And tighten the knot firmly double in the circuit of the needle, and mix some herbs from two parts together, and add the two lips and the wound together to make it stronger; and leave the thickness of the finger and fix another needle in that place, and tie that one to the first needle as tightly as the first; and do not stop until the whole contraction of the wound has been completed.</start_of_turn
And the fine needles between thickness and thinness, because the fine needles do not bite too aggressively; and the thick ones are difficult to handle in the codena, and therefore because of this it is necessary that they be handled in thinness and thickness.</start_of_turn
And do not let the needle be fixed at both extremities of the codena too much, so that the flesh is not bitten too aggressively and that the wound does not open before its consolidation.</start_of_turn
And do not prolong the sutures too much, so that the wound is not hindered in its consolidation.
And take out the ends of the needles so that they do not irritate the patient's wound; and leave the sutures loose from all sides, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them in place until you believe that the wound has already consolidated.</end_of_turn>
And such fine sutures with needles held in this manner are more convenient for small wounds, where there is only one or two needles or around those.</end_of_turn>
More commonly, a second suture is administered: and that you administer the suture at four extremities, the shoulder and two extremities of the armpit, together, with one needle in which be faithful envolopat engual in substance and size.</end_of_turn
And when the needle has penetrated these four extremities, reduce the needle from that middle part from which you began, so that the faithful thread retracts box from the lower part to the wound, so that the suture is as strong as the other which is to the cloth.</end_of_turn
And pause between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the middle finger.</end_of_turn>
And this suture is for men.</end_of_turn
And such a suture was enough to cure the wound which had occurred in a man in his belly which was affected by a wound caused by a nail, and was the disruption of the greatest wound of a palm, and was seen from the buttocks around two palms of the heel and was the disruption in the middle of the limb; and when I had reduced it, the wound had been outside for xxx hours.</end_of_turn
And the wound was consolidated within fifteen days or so, and it healed that way; and thus I saw for a month, and it is reported that it has healed completely.</end_of_turn
And other doctors had given up that it would not heal; and by a miracle, behold, it healed without any other treatment, except that I kept the wound covered with two layers of cloth every day and I washed it diligently with honey water until it healed.</end_of_turn
And I say two kinds of sutures are proper according to the narration of Paraula.</end_of_turn
And that you begin with a suture of the shoulder, and enter the needle from the back part to the front part.</end_of_turn
And thus when the needle penetrates the shoulder and in that middle lacerate according to the rule and in length throughout the body, and leave the extremity of the armpit in which you have introduced the needle; and make penetrate in the other extremity the needle from the back to the front in the other extremity of the limb.</end_of_turn
And thus when you have finished that penetration, the hour comes to make that penetration once more in that middle limb from the back to the front; and leave the armpit extremity that is in this wound, and make penetrate the needle in the other extremity from the back to the front.</end_of_turn
And make penetrate thus the needle in that way that you make penetrate it in the armpit in the limb in the part of the body where all those penetrate.</end_of_turn
And thus begin from this middle side and go to that extremity of the armpit in the other side, and extract the needle from the shoulder which has penetrated, and then reduce that in that shoulder and fix the limb of the armpit which is in the other side to this limb; and extract that from the shoulder which is part of it.</end_of_turn
And do this once and another time, and do this once more about another time until you have completed all that is before according to that example.</end_of_turn
And the sum of this way of suturing is that you sew with thread of the same kind as the one with which you sew the skin, in such a way that you sew the armpit one palm from the part of the shoulder, and that you leave the other palm until it is finished.</end_of_turn
And the second kind of proper suture which I say is excellent for women is as follows: you must sew according to the same custom as the doctors who sew it, in such a way that you add every part to its proper part; and press the limb of the armpit to the other limb and the limb of the body to the other limb, which is done as I have recommended to you.</end_of_turn
Since you have kept the needle in the limb at your will from the front part, make it penetrate to the back part in this way, and leave two armpits; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the front to the back in two armpits.</end_of_turn
And thus rotate those cascunas, and make penetrate any part of the thumb into the part of the little finger at two extremities of the mirror or as much as in the side opposite.
This method of stitching is better than the common loose stitching, and is a stitching from which memory proceeds.
This is the saying of Gualia
And I tell you this, a belly stitch is rectified with two needles, so that you enter into these with any thread, and begin with the needle that is farthest from you, and make that penetrate into the other side following the manner of those which hold the guts firmly together.</end_of_turn>
And you know that when disruption is in the middle of the belly, then the stitching of it is more difficult than that of the other parts of the belly.</end_of_turn>
More important than the treatment of the plague is the treatment of the other plagues.</end_of_turn
The cause is that when you become conscious of the recent plague in the air, the air itself changes that, and reduces the swelling and boils that accompany it adequately, and then stops over that dusty powder.</end_of_turn
And if the air has already altered the plague, then stop over that thick liquid which is at your presence until it has become like hard stone and has closed the wounds, and has solidified; and then care for that as for the care of the other plagues until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if you do not have the medicines at your disposal, then stop over that for the time being, because it begins to vomit bile, cough blood, and change two meals a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you must not take any other medicine in large quantities when the plagues are simple.</end_of_turn
And if you fear that the plague communicates by wound to the principal members, then cover that with honey-soaked linen in quality oil of rosemary, or in sweet oil, and stop that in the circle of the places which are between the armpits and leave the rest covered.</end_of_turn
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in your buttocks, when many meals have been eaten, then crush that with a black vinegar plaster, especially if the discharge is purulent and penetrates the cavity.
And you know that the one that is of the large intestine is easier to heal than that which is in the small intestines.</end_of_turn
And it is difficult to heal because the gut which is called “gegunu” does not receive the healing of the plague like the rest; and this is because of the great multitude of veins which are in it and for the greatness of it, and for the subtlety of the body of that, and for its proximity to nerves.</end_of_turn
And if what proceeds from the plague is the cloth, and you have recently obtained it, reduce that according to your custom which you reduce the swelling of the guts adequately.</end_of_turn
And if it has passed to the space and has already become green or black, then strengthen that thread over the place that is degraded by it, so that there comes a flow of health, because there are veins and arteries in the cloth.</end_of_turn>
And thus it is necessary to say that another ligament must be taken, and stop two extremities of the thread pending from the part from which the plague has departed, so that over you there may be relief from the attraction of it due to the loosening of the fabric and the emission of the vomit of the plague.</end_of_turn
Remembering the plagues when they happen in the gut.</end_of_turn>
When disruption occurs in the gut and is slight, it is possible that it is only temporary in thick liquid, to help so that you see that which was affected by the plague in the belly is now in the left side of the stomach, and the plague was ancient and had made fistula, and egesis of it is its management and expulsion.</end_of_turn
And thus I follow the treatment of it already, even though I did not have confidence in the healing of it, but I cease to subtilize when it is healed and the place is consolidated.</end_of_turn
And I have seen that when the place is already consolidated, time passes over the illness that you have suspected about it in the belly; and do not think of any other mishap that has happened and remain in your thousand anxieties eating and drinking, and approach in bath and exercise in your saying.</end_of_turn
And I have heard from experienced people that when the plague is in the gut, and is slight, it is necessary to tie it up according to this manner: take large peppercorns; and having adjusted the two lips of the plague, place one peppercorn at the entrance of the mouth over the two lips of the plague; and when you take hold of these and stretch out your mouth, the head of the plague will break off, which adheres and is not dissolved.</end_of_turn
And immediately stop another bleeding from the first one, and do not cease until another bleeding stops at the same rate as the first.
And immediately reduce the swelling and pain; and keep those extremities included in the swelling within the gut until the swelling has disappeared; do not cause any further harm to the patient.</end_of_turn>
And indeed it is possible that the gut is adhered to the surrounding fat which is the cause of the gut of the beasts that are attached to it; for it is more like a needle. And that you take hold of these fat tissues of the gut, and that you do not tear them, and that you bind them together with a ligature, covering them with a covering, and that you introduce that ligature through needles and sew them up again.</end_of_turn>
And such a stitching of these wounds is nothing other than by way of hope and trust.</end_of_turn>
May be if the plague is great and wide, mostly if it is in one of the small intestines, the hour is not that of violence but of subtility, and not of their healing but of their preservation.</end_of_turn
Take care of the wound and fistula.</end_of_turn>
You know that every plague and swelling, when it has passed its prime and becomes old, is transformed into a wound; and that it is not solidified but escapes everywhere, and is called an ulcer in any member at all times, and we call that bleeding.</end_of_turn
And fistula, truly, is a foul, tough, white wound that causes no pain and which is concaved just as a wound of suffering; and for this reason it is called a wound of penalty.</end_of_turn
And the home of the wound is moisture, which escapes quickly; and when the moisture has escaped, the wound is healed in a few hours.</end_of_turn And many herbs have this moisture, which is soft, little, great, and subtle.</end_of_turn
I have already shown all these causes, and the signs of these and their treatment with medicines in the division.</end_of_turn
And thus I tell you the treatment for fistula, which is by means of surgery with the hand.</end_of_turn
And you know that fistula can occur in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that arise from the great veins and arteries, or from the nerves, or from the liver, or from the gut, or from the bladder, or from any of the vertebrae, or from any of the compound joints such as the hand and foot; and from those that give proximity to the main limb and resemblance.</end_of_turn
Therefore, of these fistulas, which are treated in this way, are among the diseases of difficult healing, and do not receive cure, and are occupied with work and ignorance.</end_of_turn
And if it is one of these fistulas of which the depth does not reach these places that I have said, and you hope and trust in the cure of them, and you wish to learn of them, then you must attempt to remove or cut out the fistula, and if the fistula goes according to rule, ask for it.</end_of_turn
And if the fistula is crooked, then investigate the cause of the curvature, for the swelling of the belly is relieved and curved because of the curvature.</end_of_turn
And if the fistula is full of pus, it is not possible for you to know about it by attempting.</end_of_turn
Therefore, glorify the Lord for his works, for the humidity by which you cleanse these others goes from them and runs away from them.</end_of_turn
And inquire cautiously, according to what manner it is possible for you to know if here you have bone or nerve, and whether the curvature of the fistula is long or short, or whether it is a fistula to which there is pus or not, and this is over all that you can do with all your strength, with your prudence, with which you question the patient, with which you ask about the pain, and the invention of the pain due to your compression with your hand over the area, and the resemblance of the symptoms and the causes of the swelling.</end_of_turn
E when thou art stood over all those causes art thou at rest: then go to the cure according to confidence: that is, consider whether it is an apparent fistula near or in the limb, distant from joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or any of the places which thou hast mentioned before.
Then dry the fistula according as it is said in the narration: and stay until that which is in that filtration and corrupt flesh is gone, and what is born in the orifice of the flesh, or in bone and marrow, or anything else that is there, be cured thereby
May be if the fistula is of great depth, and is according to rule, then cover that in the prepuce as much as possible, and make soft all the corrupt flesh; and give tepid poultices covered with medicines that are acute; and introduce them into the cavity of the fistula, which thou hast comprehended with iron.
And do thus until any vegetable matters have been consumed by the acute medicine that has corroded all that is rotten in the cavity of the fistula of corruption
And then restore that which was removed from the parts that engendered sound flesh until it is healed.
Or if it is not healed by this, then cauterize that as we have recommended.</start_of_turn>
Or if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you must certify that, then inquire about that and dry that as we have recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or major limb as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Or if the bone is to you discovered and is in it any corruption and blackness, then burn that out until the corruption is completely consumed; and then cure that which is in it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if it is not healed and yields blood as well as before, then know that thou art not arrived at the entire eradication of the corruption; and then thou shalt uncover it further and diligently inquire about it and make the reason and the treatment of it more powerful, and restore that.</start_of_turn
And therefore if it is healed, well; but if not, know that that corruption is in the profound depth of the body, which has not been overcome, and then leave it to that which does not suffice, but lay aside that.</start_of_turn
Or if the corruption of the bone is small, or you are able to pull it out, then pull that out with fine forceps which are convenient for that.</start_of_turn
Or if there be multiple bones, then diligently perform the extraction of all of them, and of those do not leave any cause for your strength.</start_of_turn
Or if there is any cause of the humors, and in their incision there is no fear or error, then cut those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and deliver the bones.</start_of_turn
Or if you are not prepared to bear the bones of your time, then stop over the plague that is in the wound, and leave that until that which is around those bones of flesh and ligaments is expelled, and keep the wound from solidifying, and restrict the incision which you have made in your operation.</start_of_turn
Having said that, if thou fear, stop over the wound covered in warm broth with olive oil, or the limb covered in Egyptian unguent, or in some other similar salve, because when they are softened those ligaments will be separated from the limb, and the bones will be loosened from the incision, and the pain will be relieved.</start_of_turn
Or if it is a great bone such as the bone of the limb or the bone of the thigh or the bone of the hip, and what is corrupted is only the face of it alone, then burn that only behind until that blackness and corruption is consumed, and then restore the wound.</start_of_turn
Or if that which is corrupted is a great part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and that completely by incision until the corruption has passed, and then cure that which is left until it is consolidated.</start_of_turn
And I recommend that you ask a man in his household to stay with you so that he can watch over you and be of assistance in your operation.</start_of_turn
For a young man of about thirty years of age, who has happened to him pain in his heel, and the parts around the bone which is above the ankle have become inflamed, and the matter is extended to the heel, and the matter is of great quantity, and there is no external cause.
And therefore the time must be extended for the error of the doctors until the swelling has gone down, and reduce the matter of bones, and the cure must be stopped until the fistula has formed, and make incisions in all the orifices through which the matter has escaped and the humors of the body.</start_of_turn
And thus the multitude of doctors surrounding him for two years, and not only those who knew him well in this art, entered that he should be called.
And behold the swelling of his limbs and the matter that flowed from him from those wounds for a great body; and already the color of that man was quite unstable and of a sickly yellow hue.</end_of_turn>
And thus I introduced the needle into one of those wounds and reached the bone.</end_of_turn>
And I saw that they all bled profusely from all parts of the swelling.</end_of_turn
And thus I fainted and pierced my finger on one of those wounds until I scraped a part of the bone, and clotted that corruption; and it was already dead and corrupted and blackened; and a part of the swelling had already perished before I had penetrated it.</end_of_turn
And thus I did what was recommended to me and prepared from the exposed bone.</end_of_turn
I say that it was not in the bone itself but in that corruption which I evacuated and prepared, and I had already drained it.</end_of_turn
Then I stopped the restoration of the plague with healing medicines for a long time, and it is not solidified.</end_of_turn
And thus I repeated the process and discovered the bone again as before, and there continued corruption in the bone.</end_of_turn
I say that from that corruption appeared to me, and thus I had to make an incision to perform the cure and restore it, and it is not restored.</end_of_turn>
And thus I discovered another vein there and I did not cease to prick the bone little by little until I had pierced the restoration of it, and it is not restored until I had pricked around a palm of it, and I extracted that with the marrow, and I restored that with medicines, and it is consolidated firmly and permanently.</end_of_turn>
And it is not necessary to repeat the operation of cutting and scraping, but for the evacuation of the purulent matter and for the scarcity of its tolerance and fear of its death, which is in all its hours for excess of useless evacuation.</end_of_turn
Therefore health is for whole healing, and nothing is in place of the hardness of the bones; and it is good to dispose of them in the belly of the body and restore their virtue; and it is preserved in their disposals and it does not make them deviate in walking or at any time in any way.</end_of_turn
But if it is prominent in the body of the limb already brought to an end, the hour is that you take a ligament and stretch that at the extremity of that prominent bone, and command someone to extend that; and stop that ligament of wool as thick as the first ligament; and then lay that over the bone which is left behind the bone that you are closing, and extend the limb so that you drive the bone to the parts beyond, and you uncover the bone over the place where you want to close it so that the saw does not burn the bone.</end_of_turn
And stop fasting or tableting lest the bone be damaged by that; for when you do that, the saw is not prohibited from cutting the corrupted bone.</end_of_turn
And cover that the sawing be done little by little over the corrupted place, for if it is in the cavity of the bone corruption does not appear in its appearance to the feeling, and forces the closure of the other vein.
If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, advance one part continuously with the other, and the corruption is in the middle of it or in part of it, the hour is that you uncover the bone throughout; and then stop fasting, and saw that of the first part where the corruption is until the closure of the other part is finished.</end_of_turn
And let the sawing be small according to the place of the corruption.
If the corruption is at the joint, prick that corrupted joint and saw the bone that is continued from the other side.</end_of_turn>
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, the hour is not in their ratio but ingenious.</end_of_turn
And if the corruption is in the part of the hand or foot, it is not easy; however, cover that you inquire about the corruption in what way it appears to you, and that you open that, and tell me what you find according to any possible disposition that is at your command, and in this way either the vein or the nerve will be rectified, when it does not make you contradict the vein or the nerve.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must know what instruments to use and what saws to use to cut these bones are not always suitable according to the situation of the bones, and the preparation of those, and the size of those, and the thinness and greatness and smallness of those, and the hardness and rarity of those; for it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation a convenient instrument for that operation.</end_of_turn>
You know that this operation signifies for you the great study, length, and knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the methods of diseases, which you already have in your mind for your own practice in relation to all diseases.
And I say to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will find mentioned as simple, with which you must proceed at your peril, which you will experience on the others. Form of greeting:

And it is not proper that the heads of the joints should be confronted when they are corrupted, or that the great mouth be wide open.</start_of_turn

Reasoning like a small tentacle.</start_of_turn
The other smaller incisor.</start_of_turn
The other incisor; this one resembles a a ray, and its extremity is like a claw, and it is exhibited in many places in relation to the bones.</start_of_turn
The ray which convenes in proportion to that which is perforated by the bones.</start_of_turn
And its extremity is triangular and acute.</start_of_turn
And it is made of Indian steel, and it resembles all the causes which we have mentioned of razors and of incisors and of saws.</start_of_turn
From the incision of the extremities and the closing of the bones.</start_of_turn
The extremities are sometimes affected either by an intrinsic cause or by an extrinsic cause, or when you have treated that corruption for the care of those medicines and the care does not suffice, or sometimes the corruption goes away from the limb without your having perceived any cause, for in such a case you must inscribe that limb within that space which the pain has spared, so that the disease may be driven out by that means or by some other more serious defect of the limb.</start_of_turn
And the sign of that to which this applies is that the limb is black within before it is healed that the fire has already consumed it, or that it grows pale near the blackening before the blackness has passed from that limb in which you saw it and which preserves all the parts; and therefore I advise you to inscribe that limb of you.</start_of_turn
And in the same way if the cause of the corruption be a blow from some venomous causes such as a scorpion of the sea or a viper or a worm and of the like.</start_of_turn
And if the corruption or the blow is in the extremity of the finger, then you must inscribe the finger and do not leave space for the corruption to enter your hand.</start_of_turn
And in the same way if you reach the hand, then you must inscribe that of the root of the bone, and do not leave space for the corruption to enter until it has passed from the bone of the arm.</start_of_turn
And if you do not know it, then you must inscribe the arm within the groove in the joint.</start_of_turn
And if another comes, the corruption sometimes passes from the groove, then in that case is the death of the disease; and to administer another cause another time in care is a quantity of virtue.</start_of_turn
The pain in the foot is like that which arises from corruption within the bone of the foot, and in such a case you must pierce that which has penetrated one of the nails.
If you take hold of the foot, then pierce the whole foot.</end_of_turn> Or if it has gone deep inside, pierce the cavity within the joint of the bone.</end_of_turn>
And if the corruption has already spread over the bone, then do nothing but allow the pain to die, and let the patient rest in peace.</end_of_turn>
The manner of piercing the limb or of cutting it is that you grasp the ligament in the place where you wish to pierce, and grasp another ligament over the area; and extend the minister a ligament to the lower parts, and extend the minister another ligament on the upper parts; and you uncover the marrow which is between two ligaments without breaking through all the marrow; and then either pierce or cut.</end_of_turn
And that you keep the limb perfectly still from all parts so that you do not touch the bone itself, and that you bring the patient relief by means of adjusted treatment and afterwards apply cautery.</end_of_turn
Or if blood flows forth when working, then you cauterize the area superficially, or suspend your work until the blood vessels are narrowed; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.</end_of_turn>
And then bind up the affected limb with a ligament as desired, and care for the area until it is healed.</end_of_turn
I urge you to take counsel from a man skilled in surgery, for this method of treatment which I have recommended is one which is very dangerous to the soul of the patient, like a fire which has been kindled in the soul.</end_of_turn
And that corruption is first of all in the marrow of the bone until it extends throughout the whole foot.</end_of_turn>
Then that man should prepare himself for this treatment more than if he were going to undergo the care of an expert, for the violence of the pain and the suffering of the limb, and he should pierce the foot within the joint, and the fire will heal.</end_of_turn
For a long time that method of treatment has been indicated for the disease of the thumb.</end_of_turn
And thus I came to know that this excessive procedure has been shown to have no effect in relation to the practice of medicine, for it does not remove the cause of the disease; and it is not useful in the treatment of the body, but rather it begins to cause suffering in the hand itself from the outset.</end_of_turn
I ask you to pierce the hand, and I do not fear the result of that excessive procedure, for I believe that the power of the disease is greater than the danger of the incision.</end_of_turn
And when I awoke from my sleep, I learned that that man had prepared himself and pierced his entire hand, and he was healed.</end_of_turn
I tell you this story only in order to illustrate the cause of this disease, and the reason for its significance and its efficacy.</end_of_turn
Beware of physicians who lack skill and whose knowledge of treatment is inferior to that of common people.</end_turn>
When an abscess forms in a fleshy limb, the space of the abscess is prolonged until collection of pus has occurred, and then it is ruptured and perforated, and the pus is evacuated, and the limb is left as if it were a vessel, and the surrounding tissue which has been subjected to this treatment appears as if it has been finely ground, and no further corruption is found in the bone or nerves or ligaments. It is simply swelling, and is not called fistula.</end_turn
However, if the space is prolonged until the corruption spreads throughout the limb, then it is called fistula and does not abate.</end_turn
The treatment for this is to pierce the entire surrounding tissue as if it were twisted, and more importantly when it is finely ground and is effective like mercury, and comfort yourself that it does not adhere to the bone due to its corruption.</end_turn
Or if you hope that the surrounding tissue will adhere and that the corruption will not have further consequences, and in the surrounding tissue there has been bruising, then you should treat that which is clustered.</end_turn
And consider the soul, and if it is great, and if the limb which is being treated emits a foul odor, then you should treat it with an Egyptian medicine which is composed of olive oil, vinegar and lead, which you should place in a vessel and cover with lead until the medicine has become soft and reached its perfection.</end_turn
And immediately take from them what is necessary and dissolve it with vinegar and honey; and instill it into that area, strengthen the orifice, and leave the medicine in for two hours.
And immediately extract that which is superfluous; and do so until the area is healed and the pain is gone
And every morning it is cleansed with vinegar of ashes, when it is not necessary to use this medicine; and take ashes of vinegar, put it on it, and do so until you confirm that the area is healed at the hour.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then do this: instill vinegar and honey and add sulfur powder, and instill vinegar and honey with some mustard, because honey has the property of softening and washing away, and mustard makes the area adhere to the skin, and more so when there is excess of stickiness and dryness
And when you have finished doing these things and you confirm that the area is healed, then instill vinegar into the area that makes the flesh rise up in it.</start_of_turn>
And take of fennel seed and dissolve it with olive oil and vinegar; or instill some medicine into the area and put others that have the qualities that I have already written in the treatise on remedies.</start_of_turn>
And if the orifice of the area is strict in which the catheter of the syringe is not received, then do this: gradually expand the area with a small needle, and stop when it is covered with soft gauze soaked in Egyptian or balsamic ointment until it is enlarged.</start_of_turn
And in the same way if the orifice is wide, then suture the edges of the area and leave it for the amount of time necessary for the injection to take effect.</start_of_turn
And if the area from which the limb hangs is elevated to the lower parts, then dry that part of the limb that is below because the limb will run outwards, because when the limb is contracted in the swelling of the area the flesh will be pressed outwards.</start_of_turn
And if it is not possible to dry the limb externally around the bone according to your desire, then I tell you to prepare the limb with the preparation that is usually used for it and that it should not be retained by any cause of the limb.</start_of_turn
May that which is over the area be kept for an hour in order that the swelling that is caused by the limb be reduced.</start_of_turn And to know if the swelling that comes from the limb is much or little, or is digested or undigested.</start_of_turn
And take into consideration the state of that area, if in it the patient feels pain or not, and if there is swelling.</start_of_turn
And when the treatment is prolonged in this way, and you see that the matter that has adhered to the area already adheres, or has appropriate adherence, then do this: remove it for a day or two, and when you remove the dressing, change the dressing for another and renew the ointment.</start_of_turn
And if there is some slight space left in the area, do not be afraid of the adherence of the dressing, for the healing of the area is appropriate, for in some it is late for the generation of flesh in the wounds, and in others it is useful to the contrary.</start_of_turn
And if the limb has been swollen for several days and the limb is undigested, then I tell you that the limb does not adhere; and if the adherence of the limb is delayed and is the cause of the prolongation, then do this: adjust in the exclusion of the medicines, and if the medicines are humified in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry just like fennel seed when adjusted in excess.</start_of_turn
And if you wish to expedite the healing, take fennel seed and dissolve it in olive oil, and pour it over the area with vinegar that has been previously diluted in its substance, and do this until you feel comfortable with it.</start_of_turn
And thus it appears in this action, when not braced, that the drug called diafinicon is better when it is cold than when it is warm, and use it; or that you take myrrh, aloes, and incense, grind them all together and sprinkle them over the warm bath, and line the bath with vinegar and strengthen the sponge over the limb; and line the sponge with the cold drug that you have just put in, and sprinkle it over the sponge and strengthen the sponge again.
Some physicians also administer rhubarb, angelica root, lily of the valley (which is a celestial lily) and barley, centaury, and use these simples alone or combined, grind them up and sprinkle them over the warm bath that I have recommended; and use it.</end_of_turn>
And if the pain persists and is not healed by this treatment, it is necessary to know that the disease is in the bones or in the other limbs or joints; then you must perform an inquiry concerning the bones or the other parts of the limb, as is usually said.</end_of_turn>
Treatment of boils and nails, attraction and incision of the finger added to section.
Boils are swelling that does not leave the nail of the finger bent from the palm of the hand or foot, and which is strong in the other fingers, and when it is prolonged its treatment is less valuable, or it is gangrenous, and it lets out a stench as long as it consumes the root of the nail, and it is strong in consuming the whole, and strong in causing its corruption to the bone as long as it has a foul odor, and is beneficial to remove the limb when it is rotten, and its color is pale.
And therefore when you have done what we said in the division and it does not relieve your pain, then you must know that you must burn away all the superfluous parts that remain of the nail and then cauterize the ulcer nearby so that the cautery does not cause further harm.</end_of_turn>
If the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the surrounding parts of the nail have already become soft and begin to decay, then you must know that you must leave the angle of the nail that is biting the flesh alone, and remove the surrounding tissue with your fingers and instruments; and leave over only the part that remains of the flesh from the corrosive medicines until it is all consumed; and then treat the remaining part until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If the disease has already progressed in the bone, then you must know that you must extract the bone and remove it, for no time is it beneficial to keep it rotten.</end_of_turn>
And if sometimes the corruption and the decay go down to the finger, then you must know that you must remove it at one of the joints according to the nature of the wound, and treat the remaining part until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If the nail has percussion or cutting, and there is acute pain, then you must know that you must initially apply pressure to the patient, and then dry the nail with a rough sponge or a transverse section of lint, and take care that the section does not penetrate the flesh which is left under the nail, because this will cause the acute pain to worsen; and if there is any excessive flesh remaining, remove it carefully.</end_of_turn
Just as it is natural in many households, it is strong in meat, and strong in bones, or strong in nails.</end_of_turn>
The cause of these is the origin of the joint, or the origin of the bones of the limb.</end_of_turn The one that is originated in the bones of the finger does not cause harm, but that which is originated in the joints is harmful.</end_of_turn>
As for those that are fleshy in origin, the section is slight, and you must remove the root with a blunt sponge.</end_of_turn
As for that which is originated in the joint, the treatment is difficult; and therefore beware of the amputation of the limb.</end_of_turn
If the origin is in the bone, you must know that you must at the beginning pierce the flesh around the bone to the bone, and then insert with one of those sharp instruments that are convenient at that time, and treat until it is healed.</end_of_turn
When consolidation happens between the bones due to the heat of the summer or the birth of the child, or by the consolidation of the wound or by the burning of fire, or by remaining in place, then you must know that you must remove that consolidation until the limb returns to its natural shape.</end_of_turn
And thus you must stop between their layers of fat with olive oil so that they do not stick together, and separate between them, or place between them a layer of soft lead until it is consolidated as you see fit.</end_of_turn
If something solid adheres to the palm of the hand, dry that solid according to its preparation and bring it back to the limb's shape.
From the beginning of the vice, so are varices.
Vices are varices, and these are veins surrounded by large veins filled with black bile that flow in the limbs of the body, and their greatest movement is in the thighs, and most of all in the thighs of travelers, laborers, and porters
Then when you administer an purgative of the body of black bile some vegetables along with strong expulsion, and bring blood to the patient from the basilica vein
May the care of them be according to two methods: one is that it is without knowledge and that one black sand is cast upon it, and the other method is that the vein is elevated and all is extracted
The incision is done in this manner: grasp the limb at the beginning with cold water until the large black sand is resolved, which is beneficial for the limb, and then stretch the limb of the patient towards the upper part of the thigh with a bandage, and then dry the vein in one place, or in two, or in three in a wide section, and elevate the black sand towards the lower part of the thigh until it reaches its proper place, and let it fall, until the quantity that you want has fallen, and which will tolerate the virtue of the patient
And so do that, and order them to abstain from foods that produce black bile.
Repeat the treatment for phlebotomy when the veins are swollen and when the patient feels better
May the elevation of them be done in this manner: you raise the limb of the patient, if there is movement in it, and put it in water and grasp the limb with cold water until it turns red and the veins are relaxed; or that it is exercised by strong exercise, if there is no water at your disposal, until the limb is scorched
And so dry the cord in the root of the vein by cutting in the long or in the back of it must give it a blow, or in the lower part of it must cut it off
And so close the cord with nails and remove the vein from all around until it appears, and when it appears you must know that sometimes that request is diminishing towards blackening
And so avoid it and the cord when sometimes that white thing that is cord.
And so put your hands down when it is elevated and is freed from the cord, and suspend it with an egg-shaped weight
And so make another incision near that incision for three fingers, and so remove the cord from below the vein until it appears.
And so elevate that and make an incision in the lower part of the second incision must cut it off, and so extract that and elevate that until it is expelled through the second incision, and so extract that from the first incision.
And do that until you have extracted that from the most superior or highest part of all the incisions, until everything is expelled; and when that is done make the incision again
And if you do not obey my order to extract and elevate, then put in a strong needle and double it and tie it off, or put your hand over it and rotate it all around until it is numb And take care that it is not injured; for if it is fractured, it is useful for you to have difficulty elevating that because of that document.
When that is all over, then pause over the place of the wound with a greasy cloth soaked in wine and oil rubbed with oil that is not greasy, and care for that until it is healed
And if the bite is contracted without having a wound at the place where the covering has been placed, and that is not according to our instructions, then you must cover that the bite is over the whole area of the wound and the places where the covering has been placed, and suspend that with nails until you elevate that whole thing
Take care that you do not cut the vein or that you do not damage that, for that would make it difficult for you to elevate that; and use your prudence in that
The manner in which the incident is done in which the bite is dried
It is not necessary to be accurate with nails or to have acute ends so that it does not damage the vein; and it has great flexibility like a lion, because if it were brittle, it would break the vein because of its brittleness; having in it a great excess of greatness as we have said.
From extraction of the vein in the thigh.
This vein originates in the buttocks as well as in Arab lands and India, in dry and arid regions where there is little vegetation and no rain.</end_of_turn>
It is also found in other parts of the body, especially in the buttocks.</end_of_turn>
Its origin is putrefaction which leaves the skin like that of serpents and worms, and spiders and other creatures that live between the skin and bone.</end_of_turn
The sign of the arrival of this vein is that it causes violent inflammation in the buttocks; and in this place it is seen; and from this place the vein seems to rise from the place of that inflammation which appears like a wound caused by a plant.</end_of_turn
And thus when you have come to the extremity, then cover that with a plum of lead whose weight is equal to two drachmas. Enter it to two drachmas, and note that and leave the lead suspended from the limb.
And so many times as you see fit for the parts outside, cover them with lead and note that.</end_of_turn And if it is not prolonged, then withdraw a part of it and cover the rest; do not touch that which is contracted until it is outside and discharged, for if you touch that which is contracted, it enters the bone and causes abscess, swelling and ulceration of the flesh.</end_of_turn
For it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is completely expelled from the buttocks and no residue remains in the body.</end_of_turn>
And from this vein is said to be in some that it is as long as five palms and ten fingers, and I have already known of one that was more than twenty palms long.</end_of_turn
And if it is injured at the time of treatment, then insert the needle into the groin of the thigh and pierce that along the thigh to the bone, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer putrefying medicines to the area for several days, along with medicines; and care for that for the cure of abscesses.</end>
And this vein often causes swelling, especially when it appears in the groin or the foot, and it causes many wounds, and it is said that it is from some ulcer.</end_of_turn
And therefore care for that as we have said in the division and as regards what has been said before.</end_of_turn>
From the cutting above, worms are generated under the skin and is called bovine dropsy.</end_of_turn
This disease is called in many lands bovine dropsy because it is often seen in cows and is like that which is between the skin and the bone, and it goes through everything pushing and swelling, and is shown by the patient's feeling of stiffness in the limbs until the bone is broken and the skin is discharged.</end_of_turn
And the origin of this is from the putrefaction of some humors as well as from worms and serpents and worms and fleas in the belly.</end_of_turn
It is feared for its malice, for when it enters the body and is elevated to the head, it causes great swelling and pain, and that is what causes the swelling of the limbs.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you want to cure this and extract it, do not do so without having noticed the symptoms and the appearance of the disease, and when you have noticed that cover that which is over it and that which is left behind it with a strong ligature and constriction, and dry over it and extract it.</end_of_turn
And if it is prolonged in the bone and you do not find it there, then stop the cautery on the surface of the limb until it remains, and the greatest cause of this is the corruption of that which we have said.
Or if it sometimes reaches the head towards the heel, then strengthen over the nail with great stricture, and dry over it, and extract it; and let the patient take purgatives to evacuate foul humors, and guard against foods that generate putrefaction.</end_of_turn>
From the cutting above, dropsy.
This disease is called in our land nafir, and it is a pain that is seen in various parts of the body, and it is often confused from one part of the body to another.</end_of_turn
And indeed, I have already seen such a case in which I recommended it. I was called to a woman in pain at a village, and I found a small swelling in the groin vein of her arm, and when I rested for an hour, I saw that swelling disappear as quickly as it had appeared, as if it were gold that had been thrown around.
And then I went away from the pain of that place and remained in the muscle, and I sat there for an hour.
And I sat in the other part until I reached the other arm
And I recommended to him that he should rotate his whole body as I saw; and I was amazed at the transformation of things and the speed of the limb to limb And indeed, I have already seen such a thing in my life following that manner, however I have seen many others who have found relief from pain when their limbs were rotated from limb to limb However, I have not seen anything like that in these people.
And I do not think that it is anything other than that the woman was old, with many bones and veins exposed, and in this way it appeared to me that there was that rapid movement of limbs
It is necessary that it does not appear in those who are delicate and have soft humors of veins covered with fat
And as you wish the care of them, and the patient has that pain, do not be afraid of its appearance as it has been said, but strengthen your hand over that area and leave it excited and dry over that until the rapid movement is stifled, and cauterize the place.</start_of_turn>
However, if you do not see it in the thighs, when you strengthen that which is the expulsion of the limb and what expels the movement, and sing those that are like small grains of barley and like small pills of serapi and similar.</start_of_turn>
From the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their species and the places of the body in which they are cast, because their diversity is that of those which have large heads, and small, and concave, and solid; and of those which have three angles, and of those which have tongues; and of those which have handles.</start_of_turn
And from the throat of the servant when he touches the arrow and it passes through his skin, and it is situated on the cyst which is over the head, because this happens by its strong heat, swelling, dizziness, vomiting in the belly, pain in the limbs, inflammation and swelling of the tongue, spasm and confusion of understanding and vomiting of bile, and great strength is lost in speaking and the voice is destroyed, and it is situated in the place of the wound moisture white resembling blood clots, and it looks like the moisture of blood.</start_of_turn
And therefore if you perceive this danger, do not delay in the care and the extraction of the arrow, if not outside.</start_of_turn
However, the signs of the arrow when it touches the heart are that it is near the left breast, and that it is in a solid cause, and not a soft one; and the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of a worm, and runs with the black plague, and if it reaches that degree of coldness of the extremities, and sweating, and faintness; and therefore you must know that death approaches at all times.</start_of_turn
And the signs when the arrow has pierced the lung are that it immediately brings out blood-stained sputum, and the veins that are in the belly are clotted, and the color of the sickness changes, and great breath is exhaled, and there is a request for fresh air.
And if the arrow hits the small intestines, and the pain is that of the lower back, it is very great with great heat and with great breath, and it does not move all the muscles of the limbs.</start_of_turn
And if the arrow hits the stomach, then great strength is lost of the digestion of any food.</start_of_turn
If the arrow is lodged in the belly and remains there, there will be some wound of the plague, or the dressing, or the intestine which is ruptured, and no hope of recovery from the extraction of the arrow.
If the arrow enters the bladder and comes out with the urine, and it proceeds from it any cause to the outside parts, and there is much pain in the abdomen, it is known that it is deadly
Likewise, the other members such as the face, the jaw, the chest, the armpits, the spine, the scapulae, the ribs, the breast, and the limbs are saved as far as possible when the arrow does not hit a vein or artery and is not a venomous arrow.
I recommend that you take notice of the being of these arrows, for they signify for you about the treatment of your condition
The cause of which is that in a man who was hunting an arrow entered the tear duct of his eye at the root of his nose, and I extracted it from the other side, leaving the pupil of his eye gray, and he was healed, and did not suffer any damage to his eye that night
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew who had been hit in the gray of his eye, leaving the eyelid behind, and the arrow was already hidden, and we could not find it except for a small piece which adhered to the side of the eye, and it was a great arrow of the Turkish sharp arrows, with a lion's head which had no pupil
And thus is the Jew healed, and did not suffer any damage to his eye except for the wound caused by the arrow
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian who had been struck in the chest, and it was an Arabian arrow, and there were two guides alongside it; and when I saw that it had already sunk into the chest of the Christian, I withdrew it with great care, and the Christian was healed
And I extracted another arrow from a man who had been struck in the belly, and I thought he would die from it; and therefore, when more than xxx days had passed and there was no improvement in his condition, I pierced the arrow and pulled it out, and he was healed, and did not suffer any damage from the wound
And I saw a man in whom an arrow had entered both of his thighs, and the plague was consolidated upon them; and when I approached after seven days, I found that the arrow had come out at the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman who had been struck by an arrow in the belly, and the plague was consolidated within her, and it did not change in her condition even when she rested at rest, and the woman did not suffer any pain in any of her natural operations
And I saw another man who had been struck by an arrow in his face, and the plague was consolidated and the arrow was broken, without any pain, and he seemed to be well.
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king who had been struck in the middle of his nose, and it had already declined to the right side a little, and the arrow was completely hidden.
And I was called to care for him shortly after the arrow entered, within three days.
And then I found the plague of the arrow was not severe; and then I questioned her about any attempt to extract it, and she did not feel any pain; however, she still felt a slight pain where the pupil of the eye was missing, and I hoped that that slight pain was due to the tip of the arrow.
And I plastered over the area with an adhesive plaster that has an astringent and digestive virtue, confident that the area would recover because it seemed to me that the arrow had come out in that place, and that it was enough to remove it from there
And there was no significant accidental damage to the area where the arrow had entered; and I continued to keep the plaster on for several days, and there was no further pain; and the plague consolidated steadily, and the pain from the extraction of the arrow disappeared after a few days, since on the seventh day I found the arrow had come out by itself and I learned of it from the patient.
And then I discontinued acute corrosive medical treatment for several days until I could examine it, and when I examined it I found the tip of the arrow adhering to the belly of the arrow
And then I adjusted the application of the plague for that acute medical treatment until it appeared to me that the tip of the arrow was visible, and I left it alone for the period of four months.
And then when the plague had become more intense, I thought it possible to remove the forceps from it, and I bound up that area, and I did not observe any sensation, and when I tried in various ways to manage the situation, except for one day when I managed it in the way described at the end of this chapter, I extracted the arrow; and I restored the plague to its former state
And some doctors say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored, and I restore that and the plague is consolidated, and the disease is cured completely, and it does not return in it for any cause.
I recommend that you extract some hairs from some part of your body so that you can understand what I have not said, for the limits of this art and the definitions of this matter are not comprehended either by the narration or by those who are free
And the learned artists compare it to little about motion; and in what is present they are absent in what is absent; and they find new operations and new instruments that must be descended from the causes external to the art when an accident occurs
And therefore I say that needles are not excluded from the limbs in which they are placed, but according to two methods: either by attraction of the tissue in which they are entangled; or on the contrary of the other side
And that which is placed by the tissue in which it is introduced, or is a needle proceeding from flesh, is thrown out and excluded
And if you do not obey this time of the cat, the hour that you leave it will be for several days until the flesh around it is softened, and the attraction of it and its exit will be relieved
In the same way if it is placed in bone and you do not obey it, the hour that you leave it will be for several days and repeat that with attraction and movement in every day, and it will be excluded
And if you do not obey it for a few days, the hour that you perforate in the circuit of the needle in that bone of the whole part with a slight tremor until the tissue is softened by the needle, and then extract that
Even if the needle is already hidden in the body of the limb, and is hidden from the feeling, the hour inquires about that which you attempt, and if you sit that down, the hour pulls that which is convenient for the attraction of it
And if you cannot do it because of the constriction of the plague and the length of the period, and here it is neither bone nor nerve nor vein, the hour refers to the plague until it is amplified and the needle can be extracted.
And if you have to deal with those which are long, the hour delires the tissue in which it is placed throughout the whole part with all the skill you can; and think about it, if you cannot do it except by the fracture of the nails and the twisting of those, until you obey
And when you administer the extraction of the needle in any place, the hour uses at all times your hand and forceps for all parts until you make that obey; and remind yourself with a slight tremor that the needle is not broken and that it is useful for your difficult attraction and for that extraction
And if you cannot do it from that of your hour, the hour leaves it for several days until the parts that are in the circuit of it are softened, and then repeat that until the hour is relieved Even if it opposes the flow of salvation, the hour administers what we have said of care in the head
Keep your prudence of incision of vein or nerve, or of cord, and administer skill in any way you can for the evacuation of the needle; and do it with such facility and tranquility and tardiness and calmness as I have said and as you have recommended
And therefore you must counteract the needle so that the disease is in accordance with the figure according to which you must follow the movement of the needle in it, for that is more useful Even if that is not possible for you, the hour administers what is possible for you for the figures
Even if the needles that are excluded by the contrary of the other side, or that already proceed from any part to the parts of the outside, or make the transmission of the needle difficult by feeling of the part following the tendon proper sometimes; then you must desist from that; and let the incision be according to the quantity in which the forceps take hold; and then pull that, for it is useful for the movement.
If it is retained in the bone, the hour your thumb moves contrary to its natural course, and expands itself to its middle, then extract that.
Otherwise leave it for a few days, and then repeat that until it comes out.</end_of_turn>
And if the tip of the arrow is in that, then immediately pull it out.</end_of_turn>
If it is caught and you wish to administer a pulse, then insert your hand inside and grasp the arrow, if it is blunt, twist it around until you bring the hollow part of the arrow alongside the tip of the arrow and immediately pull that out.</end_of_turn>
If the arrow is curved, then immediately pull that out by grasping it firmly inwards, so that the arrow is relieved by that.</end_of_turn>
And if the arrow is poisonous, then cover that part of the flesh where you saw it, if possible, and immediately treat that area with what you deem necessary.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow has pierced the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and is close to that so that you can reach it with your hand, then cut away that part and save yourself from infection of veins or nerves, and extract that, and immediately apply pressure if necessary, and treat that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Form of forceps with which arrows are grasped:</end_of_turn
Their extremities are like the beak of a vulture that are useful like a saw when they grasp the arrow so that it does not slip away.</end_of_turn
And there are various types of forceps, large, small, medium and fine, according to the quantity of the greatness of the arrow and the scarcity of the wound, and the breadth of the wound, and the constriction of the area.</end_of_turn
like a ray so that the penetration of the arrow is alleviated and is grasped by that.</end_of_turn
Of phlebotomy of the veins.</end_of_turn>
The veins from which phlebotomy is usually performed are ...,</end_of_turn of which are in the cap of ...,</end_of_turn two pulse veins which are close to the ankles, which are called the alisians; two veins that are in the two temples that appear; and two veins that are in two holes of two nails which are called the aspicientz; and the vein prepared in the middle of the face, and the vein that is in the extremity of the nose; and two veins that are in the cheek; and two veins that are in the lips; and two veins that are in the chin; and these are called the algelic veins; and there are two veins that are on the tongue.</end_of_turn But the veins that are phlebotomized in the armpits are worth .v.;</end_of_turn because one of them is a cephalic vein, and it is on the outside; and the people call it "the vein of the head", and it is blind, and is a minor vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilica, and of another branch of the cephalic; and they call that "the vein of all the body", and basilica is the vein that is stopped in the domestic lap, and is called "citillar", and they call that "the belly vein"; and the brachial vein, which is stopped over the elbow, and that is phlebotomized, and that appears on the elbow for its appearance; and the ulnar vein, which is between the thumb and the little finger, and is in them two branches.</end_of_turn
And in the foot and the leg there are three veins; one of them is that which is beyond the curvature of the nail of the outside; and the second is saphenous, the place of which is beyond the ankle of the domestic lap; and the sciatic vein, the place of which is beyond the ankle of the outside; and in the leg there are other veins similar to those.</end_of_turn
The help of the veins that are close to the ankles is to stop ancient catarrh, emigration, saffranemia and ulcers of the head that are old evils.</end_of_turn
And the quality of bleeding those is according to what I recommend to you: that is that it should be rapid from the head of the patient, and should be frequent from the head of the patient in the occipital region where both veins are close to the ankles in two depressed places of the head; and that you should hold the patient's hand there, and if you feel faint from those, here you should take hold of the hand.</end_of_turn
Aprop tu pren la lancea cutellar, e es aquela que es inscident, e aprop tu intromet aquel dejos la vena en la codena entro que·l fleubotomi vengua al os. And raise your hand over the vein and the groin to the parts below and pierce the vein at the point where it is most likely to enter. And the length of the incision should be the quantity of two fingers adjusted or around as much as you wish; and do it quickly as much as you will
And immediately apply pressure with powder and leave that until it is healed
And thus it is done with the beginning of the treatment of the wound and its cauterization.
More of the two veins and arteries that are at the temples help in the treatment of phlebitis than the ancient emigration, and so bad edema and obstruction of the bile and acute swelling of the humors.
And the quality of phlebtomy in these is as you will recommend to me: constrict the patient's body until the two veins are clearly seen to be present and to feel their pulsation; and when you have done so, then do as you please.</start_of_turn>
And raise the groin over the vein to the parts below and introduce the phlebotomy needle through the skin, and elevate the vein up there; and pierce it just as you did with the other two veins; and do as much of the treatment as you require.</start_of_turn>
And remove the dressing from the patient, and stop the bleeding over the vein for an hour, and then place your hand over that area and apply pressure with powder and hold that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And thus is completed the reminder of the wound, and of the incision, and the attraction at the beginning of the treatment.</start_of_turn
And thus the benefit of phlebotomy from the vein of the front is similar to that of phlebotomy from the cephalic vein to the ancient maladies of the face and to emigration, swelling and ulcerous wounds.</start_of_turn
And the quality of phlebotomy in these is as you will recommend to me; so that the patient grasps their body with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is called forceps of which this is the form.</start_of_turn
Stop the bleeding immediately at the point where the forceps are placed over the vein and pierce it at an angle or in any other way you wish; and allow the blood to flow as much as you wish; and then remove the puncture from the patient and hold that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Some veins are opened by phlebtomy, but it does not mean that the phlebtomy is of acute extremity just as the others; for it is of remote extremity, and phlebtomy of this sort is when the bone is proper and strong as when the phlebtomy is subtle.</start_of_turn
More helpful are the two veins that are at the temples than the tears of two eyes for scabies of the hair and for swelling and swelling in the face.</start_of_turn
The quality of phlebotomy is that the patient grasps their body with a bandage, and you stand over their head.</start_of_turn
And the phlebotomy should be done according to the measure of the breadth of the vein, a little at a time, because in the area it is not solid; and if the phlebotomy is subtle, the limb of the body is fractured.</start_of_turn
And do as much of the treatment as you require, and rest over those parts, and hold them tight for a night, and then remove them.</start_of_turn
Phlebotomy of the nose vein is related to acute fever and violent sweating, and to the maladies of the face and emigration and swelling that occur in the face, and especially when it is ancient.</start_of_turn
The quality of phlebotomy in these is that the patient grasps their body with their left hand and takes the phlebotomy needle from the root of the nose straight up to the middle of the face according to the ruler, for the vein does not appear to be present here, and the blood begins to flow immediately.</start_of_turn
Be careful that you do not do the phlebotomy too quickly and gradually decrease the bleeding as you see fit; and leave that for a night, for it is restored immediately.</start_of_turn
The joint pain caused by cold humors infiltrates every part of the body, and when it affects the feet, doctors usually call it gout.
The quality of the inflammation of those [guideglands] is that the patient groans without any reason at the limit of their ability; and let the artificer be placed over the head of the patient, and let the patient sit on a chair.</end_turn>
And so, with the inflammation, draw out the vein along with the ample small one little by little; and extract according to the time or as often as necessary, and make it seem like the other vein.</end_turn
And so, remove the ligament and tighten the two veins more closely so that the patient does not suffer further, and leave inside until the plague is healed.</end_turn
The inflammation of the veins brings relief of small boils, pus-filled abscesses of the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and in the area of the eyes.</end_turn
The quality of the inflammation of those is that it makes the patient vomit immediately, strengthens the neck of the patient with a bandage, and lets the lips swell up; and let two veins be ligated, one from the right lip and the other from the left lip. The sign of each is the blackness of each of both, and more so in the area of those two veins there are many small black veins; and thus proceed with each one individually.</end_turn>
If there is any doubt, leave it to me, and do not know which one of those it is. Then you will understand at the time of incision of the greater of those, and from the discharge of pus from those.</end_turn>
And make it seem like the two veins that are in the lips outside.</end_turn
More useful for the tongue is the inflammation of the cephalic vein towards the affections that are in the gullet, to the disease of the uvula, and to diseases of the mouth.</end_turn
The quality of extracting those is that it follows the patient between the legs while he is sweating, raises the tongue, and lets go of the tongue from the root of the vein on one side and from the root of the vein on the other side, and the color of each is turning pale.</end_turn
And so extract each one; and take care that you do not touch the artery with your hand while extracting those.</end_turn><end_turn>
And the veins that are extracted in the groin are usually in all men. The extraction of these is useful in two ways: either by making a small incision or by cutting off the vein with a needle; or by cautery with an olive oil swab, and this is the way to do it.</end_turn><end_turn>
both at the same time as often as possible, and you are to open the large veins that are full of apparent fat, and those that contain thick blood clots.</end_turn><end_turn><end_turn
This cautery is of less breadth and of little pus at the extremity, and it is suitable for the extraction of small veins that contain thick blood clots.</end_turn><end_turn><end_turn
The greatest benefit of the basilica vein is that it is one of the three veins: from which you extract the blood of the affections that are left in the gullet and the neck, and from which you take the blood from the feet and the belly.</end_turn><end_turn><end_turn
And so tell the phlebotomist, when you are performing that extraction, that he should guard well that vessel and be overly cautious in that place, because if he makes a mistake and touches the artery during the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cause blood to flow, so that you must not phlebotomize that one with a pungent phlebotomy, but rather by cutting off the blood supply as is proper.</end_turn><end_turn><end_turn
If the swelling does not subside visibly, then lay the hand that you wish to save over that which you wish to move to the other side, or seek some twig or the like; or that you perform the procedure at the end of the arm where the swelling is evident; then cut away that which is inflamed in such a way as we have said.
If you wish to perform lithotomy of the bladder, then first loosen the bandage of the arm that touches the groin as far as the groin itself; and then take hold of the limb and hold it firmly; then cut the vein with a concave incision at the point of inflammation, and hold it so that the bleeding stops.
When you see, as I have said, when the ligament is taut and there is swelling in the place that you have marked with your finger, then that swelling is an embolism of the artery, and therefore stop that.</start_of_turn>
When you see that urine flows from the lithotomy as with the urine of a child, then the urine is subtle, namely that of the artery; and when you have grasped and stopped the hand mentioned above for a long distance, then stop the hand mentioned, and if the urine is exuded, since the veins have been cut, grasp the arm and leave that.</start_of_turn>
Beware of the patient's urine, and do not fear it too much, for it will heal within a few days.
If the urine does not stop bleeding, and you see that you must not use medicine for it, then ligate the artery if you see it; for the limb is contracted and the urine is exuded; or take a slight grasp of forceps, and grasp that, and take hold of the hand and grasp that over the point of the stricture of the ligament and the bones within until the next day.</start_of_turn
If the urine is exuded, it is not good; otherwise, cure that which precedes the recollection of the place where the veins were exuded which flow urine.</start_of_turn>
The excision of the artery is difficult in those situations where the area of the wound is small and where the ligament of the arm is possible.</start_of_turn>
More than the vein of the foot, lithotomy is useful in extracting the urine from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a twig of the basilica and a twig of the cephalic, as we have said.</start_of_turn
Beware of excessive tension in the lithotomy of the bladder, for that is a nerve; and when you prick the vein and find the nerve, you will cause it to go numb, and that is difficult to cure, and if it is not cured, it will not be completely healed.  And that nerve is often hidden from view by fat, and if it is not seen by anyone and is subtle and not manifest, then you must stop the lithotomy at the point where you pricked it and avoid the nerve with your strength.</start_of_turn
If the vein is between two nerves, then ligate the vein along its length.</start_of_turn
The usefulness of the lithotomy of the cephalic vein is that it extracts the urine from the head and comforts the complaints of the heels.</start_of_turn
Do it in this way, if you wish to lithotomize the bladder quickly or slowly; for that is the safety of all the veins, for neither the artery nor the nerve is left damaged.</start_of_turn
However, it is often hidden from view in fat, when it is not lithotomized at first percussion, even though it is not noticed later.</start_of_turn
It must be known that lithotomy is not administered except in the conservation of health and in hope of its success and caution against the occurrence of diseases, and that it is useful for lithotomy of one of the veins that are in the groin, that is to say: cephalic, femoral and basilica; and that it is useful for lithotomy at the beginning of spring, immediately after Lent and in autumn, and in winter when there are signs of repletion.</start_of_turn
And it is useful to lithotomize three days after or one hour before sunrise.</start_of_turn
When lithotomy is administered, it must be when there is convenience and necessity for it, whether at night or day, at any hour and at all times.</start_of_turn

Therefore, in order that the phlegmomaniac be calmed and relieved in all these circumstances.
And if the vein is burst in a vessel, it is not good; otherwise, repeat it until that place is slightly raised, or over it a little bit, if that place is not swollen.</end_of_turn>
And if that place is swollen, or the illness is spreading, then leave it alone for a day or two, and do not tighten the ligament, for fear that it will cause further swelling.</end_of_turn
Repeat the emptying if necessary.</end_of_turn>
And if the opening is small and runs smoothly, and you fear that it will not be enough to heal the quantity you wish, then repeat the emptying in that area according to the rule and adjust a little in the opening, and do so until that place is swollen, for that place is swollen in many homes requires a little more opening.</end_of_turn
Although sometimes that place is swollen, do not repeat the emptying over it, for that will not help any cause; pause over any part of the wound of oil, which relieves the body of the pain.</end_of_turn It is better in this place to use oil than any other oils.</end_of_turn>
Similarly, administer oil for the wound in every emptying where the veins are to be emptied, and make it thick and viscous when it is paused from one of those over the place, for the pain is subtle and is twisted when it is large.</end_of_turn
And if there is great swelling in the area of the emptying, where many vessels have burst, especially if that vein has not bled at all or if the opening of the vein is small, then you should cover it, and pause over the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly bruised, for an hour, for it is dissolved.</end_of_turn
And cover that which makes the pain of that vein more intense with the support of the other vein or of another vein.</end_of_turn
And if it remains in the place for several days, any blackening or greenness does not matter; and if you wish, pause over any cause of aloes or marigold dissolved, or any cause of chickweed or chamomile or something similar.</end_of_turn
Many burst vessels cause swelling and eminences after emptying from the basilica.</end_of_turn
Therefore, put your hand over that, and if you notice moisture, put your compression over that, for that swelling is bad and harmful; and now keep that you are doing until you have applied some of the things we have mentioned, for that will flow from the healthy artery.</end_of_turn
Do the same with oil which is astringent, so that the place is hardened, and take care of the other care along with this until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And cover that you extract from the vein to all men according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the color of the wound over the vein as much as appears.</end_of_turn
For if the vein is black, then leave it alone until it is well; and in the same way if you see it sometimes large, leave it alone until it is subtle; and in the same way if it is acute, until the acute pain is gone.</end_of_turn
And if it is full and strong and has need of extracting blood from a vessel, that the emptying of the vein be increased and the emptying be broad.</end_of_turn
And in those that are pale, do the opposite of that, and cover that which must be extracted in troops, and that the wound be straight.</end_of_turn
The best thing in the emptying of the vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.</end_of_turn>
This method of emptying is saved from the outflow of blood and the injury of nerves, and is more beneficial and safer than emptying by breadth and length.</end_of_turn
And to which it is accustomed to happen without fainting, do the emptying, and take care of that before the emptying with a little bit of bread infused in wine of millet or of simple oatmeal slightly bruised; and extract a little of the blood from the vein in three or four times.</end_of_turn
And if there is coldness of complexion, before doing the emptying, give a tepid bath with marigold or with aromatic honey with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and the like, or with an aromatic and fragrant bath.</end_of_turn
If sudden vomiting occurs, perform a flebotomy, as it is a cause of sudden loss of sanity. The doctor should abstain from drinking water and eating fragrant food; use aromatic substances and keep the patient's feet warm.
Use the other causes mentioned in the division in the chapter on vomiting to evacuate.
And when you wish to make it happen, stretch out the patient's arms and loosen the patient's sanity according to the physician's instructions. The purpose of the flebotomy is to move the evacuation, and its virtue is cold, which evacuates the madness gradually over several days
If you wish to make it happen, stretch out the patient's arms and loosen the patient's sanity according to the physician's instructions. The patient's body is strong, so do this within approximately seven or eight hours of the first flebotomy
If you wish to drive the madness from the body in the opposite direction of its tendency, it is necessary that this happen on the second or third day.
If the patient is already suffering from madness and is acute and causes fever, it is necessary to vomit all the madness at once and vomit a great quantity, and amplify the perception until vomiting stops. Because if you do not do this, the patient will surely die from the absence of vomiting, when the flebotomist is ignorant and negligent
Do not attempt to tear out the arms and evacuate the madness according to the physician's instructions, when the veins are already closed and the madness is difficult to evacuate. Keep that in mind and extend your hand more vigorously, for otherwise it is too bad
When the patient is bled according to the method; or remains with the acute bleeding of the flebotomy which is coagulation of the madness in the vein; or pauses over that of tyriaca alfarach, or of sage, and compresses that which is lighter until the madness is gone.
And if the vein is clotted, leave it alone and do not touch it until the clot is dissolved.</start_of_turn>
And if necessary, you must vomit the madness according to the physician's instructions, and it is not an excuse to do so on this limb or in the other arm in another vein.</start_of_turn>
And the vein called "funis of the arm" is bled in the place of the flesh or of the bone, when not found or hidden, which is composed of these things.</start_of_turn
The quality of the flebotomy of the patient is that the patient's hand enters cold water until the pain is relieved and the vein becomes apparent.</start_of_turn
And keep your hand firmly over that area and over the stricture of the bone; and bleed according to the small transverse, not the longitudinal or the longitudinal of the long axis.</start_of_turn
Let the perception be wide and your flebotomy be such as to bleed that little bit over the wrist joint.</start_of_turn
If the flow of the madness is prohibited, leave your hand in the cold water and let the madness flow into the water until you have accomplished your purpose.</start_of_turn
Even if it is summer, you are excused from the immersion of the hand in cold water, and the patient's body is kept warm in cold water in winter.</start_of_turn>
The bleeding of this vein is more useful than that of all the others, for it has neither pulsating vein nor nerves.</start_of_turn
The bleeding of the wrist vein is related to the diseases of the foot.
The quality of the bleeding of the patient is that you strengthen your hand over the bone or over your hand, because you have put it into cold water, until the vein is swollen and is clearly visible at the same time; and bleed transversely; if you do not do this, nothing will result from it.</start_of_turn
Remember that you must not touch your hand with the flebotomy, because you leave the nerves of the fingers naked of flesh.</start_of_turn
And keep immersing your hand in the cold water and let the madness flow in that way, because if you do not immerse your hand in the cold water, the madness will coagulate in the vein and will be prohibited from flowing.</start_of_turn
When the madness is extracted according to the quantity of need, then you stop over the vein with oil and salt, so that it is not solidified too firmly; and always keep your hand still.</start_of_turn
The joint pain caused by cold humors infiltrating the body often results in pain in the feet, and doctors therefore call it gout.
And it is similar to the evacuation of the other hand as you have done in the other case.
The evacuation of the spleen is helpful for the diseases that are in the lower parts of the body, such as those of the belly, and also for retention of menses, and for the diseases of the tonsils, ulcers of cavities and ancient wounds, and for their resemblance to other diseases.
The quality of the evacuation of the spleen is that it throws the whole foot into cold water and makes over that friction within which the veins appear; and it is bound over the ankle joint; and the place of the vein appears to be swollen, and from that so branch out on the surface of the foot many veins that rise up like ramps.
Therefore, if the phlebotomy is done abundantly, or if you leave the wound open over the swelling, that is better and safer
And if you evacuate that one on the surface of the foot, then you must take care of the nerves that are under that one on the surface of the foot, and stop your evacuation when you have gone through as much as you would like to insert it
Therefore, be careful with the phlebotomy.<end_turn>
If it is forbidden for you to do the work of the sanctity; however, you must repeat the evacuation of the foot in cold water and let the sanctity run in that within which it is evacuated.<end_turn>
If the phlebotomist is mistaken in the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a few times, because the place is safe; and do not be afraid of it, but take care of the nerves as we have said.<end_turn
And it is similar to the evacuation of the other foot equally.<end_turn>
And concerning the sciatic vein, the place as we have said is over the heel towards the side of the heel.<end_turn
The evacuation of the spleen is helpful for the ankle when it is for the safety of the cut.<end_turn
The quality of the evacuation of the spleen is that the disease comes in bath, and that it tightens and strengthens the belly of the foot from the side of the ankle to outside four fingers to a long strip that does not appear except for water.
Therefore, when it appears, then you must evacuate that according to each case as it is possible and according to the transversion, and that is better; or insert that for incision or evacuate that for section, because the place of it is safe.<end_turn
And this is in most homes not known; and if you find that, and it does not appear to you, then evacuate a vein of it, and that is the one that appears in the two feet rather than the ear and the ring finger.
Take care of the nerves, and run the sanctity as much as you want.<end_turn
Then remove the stricture and stop over the place of the phlebotomy so that it strengthens the place, because for curiosity it is healthy.<end_turn
From the winds and qualities of using those things.
The winds are of barley, or of rye, or of ivy.<end_turn>
And the winds are done in two ways: one is by sacrifice and extraction of sanctity, and the other is by sacrifice itself.<end_turn
And this sacrifice that is done is done in two ways, either by fire or by fire itself.<end_turn
And to the winds that are administered with sacrifice and extraction of sanctity are fourteen places of the body, of which one in which the winds are stopped is the ankle; and the fourth part of the head; and the middle part of the neck; and the winds of the mouth beyond the lips; and the winds of two spatulas; and the winds of alohost, which is at the top of the heel; and two flames; and two trumpets; and two cavities; and two buttocks.
And the winds do not extract the sanctity except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and by which they do not take the virtue of those, just as is the case with phlebotomy; nor does it suffice that the winds be done by fire or fire in any disease that is useful for the replacement until all the members of the body are evacuated.<end_turn
If necessary, provoke vomiting for illness or continuing pain, administer it at the beginning and end of the month, and in the middle of the month and at any other time as needed.
And therefore when in any case of these, and properly when it is in the third or half of the month, they command vomiting to be made more frequent than for the past two or three hours.
And together with vomiting of the nape is that when that confirms gravity to the head and to what is collapsed in the heels; more than that is proper evacuation of all the body.
And this vomiting is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic.
It is not allowed to use it of those who are of complete frigidity, or in which is catarr, for that gives to that great document.
And for that does not cover that they use it of the old people, and in the heads of which are diseases of cold.
And for that, when it is continued over this, it is fruitful to forget; and for that we command the vomiting doctor to place his hand a little below the ankle with the windward towards the heels, fearing the generation of oblivion.
And vomiting of ale is in the place of phlebotomy of the vein of the gut and of the basilica: and for that it confirms to asthma, and to the constriction of bile and to the scissura of the spasm of bile, and to hiccups, and to replacement.
And cover that the vomiting of ale be slightly thick, for if it is paused behind, it brings about debility in the body and in the stomach
And vomiting of almonds confirms to headaches and to ophthalmia, and to diarrhea, and to vertigo, and to toothache; and it is in the place of phlebotomy of the vein of the marrow.
And we command the vomiting doctor not to touch his hand with scarification so that he does not cause the artery to bleed and blood flow of salt.
And vomiting of the feet confirms to bad breath in the mouth, and to corruption of the gums, and to remaining of the diseases that are in the mouth, and it is in the place of phlebotomy of the two lips.
And the vomiting that is made over the two spatulas confirms to captan, which is useful for the replacement of heat.
And vomiting of the four limbs from the flanks of the ribs confirms together with phlebotomy of three veins, that is of the basilica, gut and cephalic, for that which attracts all the blood of all those veins more numerous than those of the others veins except for the three veins.
And we command the vomiting doctor not to proceed too much in scarification, for the location is denuded of flesh, and leaves them nerves and arteries
And this is vomiting which is vomited over the cushions and confirms to hemorrhoids of the buttocks and to ulcers more behind.
And we command the vomiting doctor that it be a great vomiting, and that it be of earth, for the location digests of great dry heat; and that many subtle vomiting be vomited and be scarified with scarification.
And greater vomiting of the chest slightly shows, for it expels the blood of all the body, and confirms to ancient pains of the ribs and of the belly, and of the bladder; and causes the menses, and confirms to bloating and edema; and it is in the place of phlebotomy of two veins, and of bile and of two cavities.
But it does not expel all the body and makes them rush to vomiting in many men.
And of vomiting that causes edema is useful in that it is like the vomiting of the two greater veins.
The quality of the position of the vomiting is that it stops the vomiting at the beginning of vomiting and resumes it in temperate succession, and does not prolong the position of the vomiting, but pauses them leisurely, and remains them moderately, and that the humors go to the place for their progress. And do not stop until you see the area already englozed, swollen, and that the redness of the area increases.
And do not stop treating and pressing slightly, and consider the condition of the patient.
For anyone with a rare skin, cover that area with a bandage and do not burn it, because the area is not to be ulcerated
Command the attendant to expand the treatment and slightly raise the area, and do so easily
And if there is pus in the area, then cover with two bandages, for in the first bandage open the passage of the subtiliation to the area and to the moisture of the area. More in the second look of the abscess acquired by the extraction of the large area.
And if the area is not bloody, then make the third bandage for it to succeed
Finally, when we wish to extract the area slightly or a little, suffice with a slight burn
And if we wish to extract a large area, burn slightly more; and if we know that the area is large, then burn more for the burn.
And the limit of burning is only the depth of the wound
And if anyone has a large, hard, fleshy wound, and their veins are stretched too tight, cover the area of the veins with softer substances; if it is in summer, thus with aloe oil or violet oil, or almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is in winter, then olive oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or Saint-John’s wort oil.
And if the swelling is large, puffy, then apply olive oil of marigold, or balsam oil, or aloe oil, or pennyroyal oil, and so on
More if the attendant has large pores of soft skin, then do not apply oil, and cover that the area of the veins should be washed with vinegar or lukewarm water, or with lime juice, or with elderberry juice, or with pomegranate juice, and so on
And if the area is moist, wash the veins with vinegar or with water of mistletoe, sage and chamomile, or so on.</start_of_turn>
And if the swelling is great, wash the veins with strong vinegar or with elderberry water, which is rue, or with chamomile or fennel decoction, or of camomile, and so on.</start_of_turn>
And cover the area from the bath; because it has to be given immediately after the bath for an hour or two, and cover the area with a cloth.</start_of_turn
What should be done so that the wound does not bleed before the dressing is applied?</start_of_turn>
Consider at the beginning: if the attendant or the one who should extract the blood is bilious and has a sudden pain in the area and inflammation, cover that you should first prevent the causes of heat, thus with cloves of garlic, and vinegar and vinegar of roses, and bay leaves, and thyme, and so on.</start_of_turn
And stop their meals thus as poultry, and bony meats, and cooked vegetables with spices, and those with vinegar, and so on.</start_of_turn
And if the area is cold, cover that it should be given almond milk, or almond meal of poppy seeds, and sage, and fragrant oil between wheat and barley; and that it should be recommended that he drink little and eat sparingly, and abstain from poultry and meat and fish and eggs and legumes.</start_of_turn
And that in the days of bleeding and phlebotomy the liquid should be more abundant than the food.</start_of_turn
And that one should stay in liquid for several hours before breakfast or eating, some strong medicine such as musk or marjoram, or alum or so, in order that the principal limbs be comforted and that the area be relieved; and do not eat vinegar.</start_of_turn
More, the winds that are to be burned are those that are on the face, and on the belly and on the heel, and on the flanks, and the navel, because these members do not suffer from the burn.</start_of_turn
E no es querit per aquelas sino atraccio de sanc de membre, ayssi cum pausam ventosa sobre mamilha en malautia de flux de sanc del sanc de las nars; e usam de aquela per que sia dissolvuda ventositat freja inviscade del membre, ayssi cum pausam sobre le ventre e l’umbelic; quar aquela rarifique le membre e scalfa lu e ramau la dolor quar resolveys ventositat.

Capitol .xcvii.
Sanguissuguas are not administered in all limbs but only in those in which the position of the veins is not possible due to their small size, thus as with the thumb and little finger; or in limb devoid of flesh, thus as with the nose and ear and the like.
And as for those who have found blood in the joints of the feet, it is necessary to use those which have been proven to be useful in similar cases.</end_of_turn>
And so they should be left lying down both day and night in warm water until they have recovered; and let no cause remain in their belly; and let the body be evacuated at the beginning with bleeding and vomiting; and let the limb of the patient be cooled down until it turns red; and let them be kept still.</end_of_turn
When they are swollen and the case is severe.</end_of_turn>
And if it is possible to drain the abscess with a needle, it is better to do so urgently.</end_of_turn
And if not, let the area be washed with warm vinegar and then covered with moist cotton wool; let it be moistened and squeezed out frequently.</end_of_turn
And if the course of the illness persists despite the bloodletting, when there remains something, let you put in a cold compress in the water, and let that remain there until the discharge has ceased.</end_of_turn
And if the illness is widespread, let you sprinkle over it powdered vitriol, or eggs and things that resemble the causes of the disease, until the illness has subsided; or let their hands be placed over the area with burnt barley, and let them remain there until the barley adheres to the area, and the illness will subside.</end_of_turn
And if necessary, repeat the bloodletting, when possible changing those.</end_of_turn
And if bloodletting is prohibited, let the area be frequently washed with the recent blood or leave a needle in the area until the pain subsides; and let them rest, for in this way the pain will cease to exist.</end_of_turn>
And when you wish to calm them, sprinkle over them a little powdered aloe or salt or ash, and cover them all.</end_of_turn
Thus ends the treatise on restoration.</end_of_turn> This chapter is very useful in the art of medicine; and is restoration of fracture and dislocation of bones.</end_of_turn
Oh, my son, be aware that many physicians and vulgar people and those who have not studied the works of the Ancients or read any of their books neglect this chapter.</end_of_turn
And for this reason it is useful that this method of the learned in our land is kept secret; and I have not forgotten it at any time in my life; and I have not hesitated to share it with anyone, but only after I had studied the works of the Ancients and understood them thoroughly.</end_of_turn
And I have confirmed this with experiments and studies throughout my life.</end_of_turn
And I have already described in this chapter all that I have learned about this science and about what I have learned from my own experience; for I have abridged what is proper to you others and spared you the burden of lengthy discussions; and I have summed up everything in the end; and I have shown you in the end of the declaration what means to administer these treatments, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.</end>
First Chapter.</end_of_turn>
Summary and collection of all that pertains to fractures of bones, from which it is necessary to depart before we proceed to the remembrance of fractured limbs and various other similar things.</end_of_turn Therefore we will speak in this chapter of the sums of the discourse; and of the chapters which are necessary to understand, for which the artificers and those who are skilled in this art are accustomed to depart from the customary methods and to seek the truth of things.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that when an accident of fracture or dislocation or twist or any case occurs, let them cover themselves at the beginning with bleeding or apply some means, or whatever they think is necessary, if it does not impede the virtue, or if it is not possible to do otherwise, because of excessive heat or excessive cold.</end_of_turn
And let them be content with their ordinary food of fresh herbs and fish and poultry and crabs; and let them abstain from large meats and from fatty foods and from all food that fills the veins of the patient, until they are assured of the absence of a cauter on the limb.
And the time has come to return the patient to their seat, which is where they usually sit.
And when the bones have healed, the time has come to feed the patient nourishing and soft foods such as bread soaked in water, broth, eggs, fish, beef, barley, peas, and lentils, because this regimen is sufficient to promote the coagulation of the fracture most gently and quickly.</end_of_turn>
Note that bones that have fractured in the joints persist in their first rigor and in the decrepit, it is not possible for them to be continued and consolidated according to their nature due to the exhaustion of their limbs.</end_of_turn>
More importantly, nature adapts and remembers that a fractured bone has been cured of any cause resembling swelling in which a thickness adheres and strengthens that which has been joined together until the end of its nourishment and rest, just as fire at the beginning, until any cause hinders this work.</end_of_turn
Therefore, it is necessary to abstain from feeding the patient foods that are heavy and viscous and large, as we have said.</end_of_turn
Note that the species of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for example, the fracture of the limb bone is different from the fracture of the skull bone; the fracture of the foot bone is different from the fracture of the thigh bone; and so on with all the other limbs.</end_of_turn
And I recall all the species of fracture, which are distinguished in the capitol distinct from each other.</end_of_turn>
There are various types of fractures in general.</end_of_turn They are diversified by the species of bone from which they originate; for example, a curved fracture is different from a fracture of the stellate bones; some fractures are classified as slight fractures according to their length: and the fractures of the skin and bones of the extremities are distinguished from each other, just as it is in writing when one writes with ink, and there is a fracture with bruising and disruption in the head, and there is a slight fracture of the bone.</end_of_turn
And for each species there is a peculiar remedy or treatment for its restoration according to what is remembered of its distinction in the different places.</end_of_turn
A sign of a fractured bone.</end_of_turn And for this reason a fracture of the bone is known: it is a twisting of the limb, and of that protrusion and appearance of the limb to the touch, and so on when one grasps it with the hand.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting or pain when touching the limb, and the patient does not experience great pain, it is not a fracture in this case.</end_of_turn
It is possible that it is a slight twisting or small fracture, in which case you must not touch the limb with your hand or compress it; in this case pause for a moment and remember the medications that are appropriate at that moment; and do not hesitate to seek stricture if necessary.</end_of_turn
Note that when the limb is curved and is not fractured into two or more pieces, as when the whole limb is affected, the time has come to begin to restore the limb that has been injured since the previous injury.</end_of_turn
If there is a subsequent injury, leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides; and then support it according to any manner that you can manage to elevate and treat.</end_of_turn
Note that the restoration of the limb and the treatment of the swelling are lighter than the bone from which the injury originates.</end_of_turn
And do what is necessary according to what is remembered.</end_of_turn
Note that even if there are fractures, it is necessary to extend this limb fractured in two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two strings or with one string and the hand.</end_of_turn
And keep the limb in the position in which you found it, while the fractured parts are extended from the limb, so that you can restore those attachments with engineering and according to any way you can manage in their places.</end_of_turn
Keep your force under control so as not to harm the patient during your operation for pain or injury; and pierce according to the tissue's power, since its companion will be with you in a thousand forms.
Therefore take advantage of your touch at that moment with your hand, and if sometimes there is some other cause, rectify that and embrace that for the quantity of your virtue
Avoid excessive extension and compression, just as foolish doctors do when they make incisions with their cautery, or when they cause contraction in the limb just as we have seen in the treatment of their boils.
And the quality of the tightening of the limb is that which I recommend; for you know that limbs are varied in their smallness and greatness and in their shape like those.</end_of_turn>
And of those that are small like the arm and the thumb and the forefinger and the like, the hour covers that the covering should be of fine matter.</end_of_turn>
More of those that are rough like the cushion or the limb, cover that in them should be a tough covering, which can connect the large limb firmly and strengthen that throughout the tightening equal, so that there is no maculation.</end_of_turn
And nearby comes, nearby your evacuation of equality, pause the convenient ligament at the place of that fracture with three coverings or four as the limb deserves; and strengthen your hand a little on the ligament.</end_of_turn>
And nearby look at that to the upper part of the place of the fracture, and strengthen less than you have strengthened the place of the fracture.</end_of_turn And nearby lengthen your covering of the place of the fracture a little, and soften the tightening little by little, until you have grasped the great part of the place.</end_of_turn
And nearby take another bandage and cover that other wound over the fractured limb with the covering, and nearby look at the coverings to the part beyond the fracture; and let your operation be in the tightening of the covering and in the softening of that as we have said in the first covering.</end_of_turn
And nearby rest between the stops of stone or material which is equal to the twisting of the fracture, if there is twisting in it; and if not, do not rest in it for any cause.</end_of_turn
And nearby rest over it another bandage, and nearby cover these firm coverings well enough, if in the limb there is no swelling or cautery burn, and the hour rests over it until the swelling has gone down; and let that rest for a few days; and the hour strengthens over them.</end_of_turn
And the strips of the greater part of the cane are of rough race, and be formed wisely; or of boxwood; or of palm branches; and let the width of any strip be like this form and this figure:</start_turn><end_turn>
But the strap that is placed over that fracture must be thicker and stronger than the others, and the length of the strap according to what is legible to the limb in magnitude and size; and nearby strengthen over the straps with another bandage according to your first tightening; and nearby secure them faithfully enough according to what we have said of tightening, that is to say that it is your tightening according to the place of the fracture, and as much as it is elongated from the fracture, it is better to tighten.
And cover that the threads be thinner in thickness and fineness, and be of lead; and if the threads are rough, just as I have seen in the treatment of boils, let them be of cords of lead during the tightening, for it is a great error when the tightening is unequal.</end_of_turn
And certainly fine threads are not convenient, because you will not succeed in tightening with them as much as you wish, and do not cover that there should be less than a finger between the strips.</end_of_turn
And if the patient is like that for the extremities of the strips, nearby tighten in those places at the times, the hour rests from leaving those of stone or wicks until they do not cause him injury.</end_of_turn
Some veins are fractured due to the plague, and accidental disruption in the coccyx, and I remember that in the capital according to singularity.
And indeed, that all the limbs fractured thus are not straight from the first day; the cause of which is that when the limb is great, it does not suffice to rest upon it immediately but rather after a few days or eight or ten, according to your estimate of the progress of the swelling
This is the way the ancients restored those with fractures, dislocations and twists
Method of dressing for the restoration of fractures, suitable for complex wounds and mainly for women and men, because it is of that from which neither heat nor cold arises: take powder of nutmeg, which is the middle of the wheat that hangs between the barley in the wheat heads.
And so be it, but if it is like this, do not burn that album of herbs, and stop the feeding of it so that it does not become thick or viscous; and use this instead
Another method of dressing for fracture, dislocation and sprain: recipe of asphalt, lapdanum, acacia, enula and marjoram, which is ground from a thousand grains of barley, five drachmas of myrrh and five of aloes, twenty drachmas of aloe. All these are ground and sieved and mixed with water or with egg white if the patient's wound is raw; and apply this dressing, which is of good composition and restores the broken bones pleasantly, and cheers up the patients.
Another method of dressing for fracture and sprain: recipe of marjoram and white alum applied in drachmas x; of myrrh and aloes applied in drachmas v; of acacia in drachmas vi; of beeswax in drachmas xx.
All are triturated in a mortar with the surrounding mortar, and are ground, and are comforted with water or with that album of herbs and should be administered
Method of dressing for joints and separated bones of these places, and for pain that occurs in these in fractures and breaks: take a lancet and immerse it in vinegar and oil and apply it to the place.
Note that in this dressing there is no virtue of restoration, of cautery and expulsion of pain properly
Another method of dressing that restores the fractures: take figs leaves out and poppy seeds saved; contain all and make a dressing of them.
Method of brief dressing administered after the restoration of fracture of bones and when you want to resolve the remaining swelling: recipe of broth, chamomile and violets flowers, barley flour, all of which is ground together. All are ground and comforted with vinegar, if the limb is not scabbed
If it is scabbed, however, the hours comfort with lukewarm water of calendula or with water and use it
Another method of dressing more powerful in resolving than the previous one, when the accident of swelling is to be overcome for the restoration of the limb: recipe of broth and linseed seeds, of barley, marigold, violets flowers, chamomile, all of which are ground together and comforted with broth or lukewarm water or vinegar, according to the quality of the limb and the degree of swelling.
Ipocras does not say in his book that it should be placed on the fractured limb except for the purpose of making a cautery of wax and oil and not for any other reason; and I recommend that it be more moderate between thickness and thinness
It is seen in Gaul that it is placed on the fractured limb after the restoration of the limb and the causes in which it is useful except for those of small heat so as nutmeg, cinnamon and the like of those causes that we have recommended
Manieyra de emplastre que comfereys a lesio e dolor: recipe migat, de cezes, de pelos de home inscizes o pena de auzel, e de altea, e sal, partidas enguals; sian trissatz e cribellatz e sian cofitz, e sia fayt emplastre.
May the quantity according to which you cover that remains to be loose, is that you consider if it is not excessive pain or swelling or that it is not broken, it is not gout of its place. And if by chance there is acute pain or swelling or inflammation, then you must cover it up or remove it at that moment, and leave the dressing on it.
And take sponge of lint and wet sponge of marine leather, and immerse that in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the swelling subsides and the pain is relieved; and then place a bandage over the area covered in vinegar and oil or olive oil, and bind over it for a night until you are sure that the burn has subsided, and that the swelling of the limb has gone down, and that the pain has disappeared
And repeat that tightening slightly and make the dressing small and do not tighten for your first constriction, and gradually increase that until it is healed.
And if sometimes the burn and the swelling and the pain and the inflammation have already subsided, and all the accidents have already passed, and you do not need dressing or constriction, then you repeat that just as you began with the initial application of the gum
And if no other cause has happened to the limb than those that we have mentioned, then do not remove it until three or four or five or seven days. and some days later when the limb is well enough for the discharge of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture has healed, and the coagulacy of the flesh over it has taken place.
And adjust in the tightening more than in your first tightening throughout, and adjust in the feeding of the patient according to the memory of that.
More if sometimes the limb of the fracture has already dried and extended more than if you do not cover it, however, you must know that the feeding is prohibited to reach that; and therefore you must give that nourishment with lukewarm water throughout that time; and do it every three days; and slightly relieve the tightening. For this operation, go to the limb the nourishment, and it will be healed without discomfort.
More than what the doctors of the fracture of the limb do, another time when it is not restored at the beginning, according to the covering, and is restored according to crookedness, is an error according to their operation, and is a great fear, and if it were known that it would increase the complaints in their free time, they would abstain from it
I have not seen anyone who does that, for it is more reasonable not to do it.
Chapter: Of fracture when it happens in the head.
The species of fractures are flakes, and their figures are diverse, and the causes are different, for any fracture is caused by the percussion of space, and the percussion stops all the bone within the capsule, which is left to the bone, as it happens in the wrist, and because of this this species is called spiral; or the space affects any part of the bone, and affects the marrow of it and does not pass through the back of it; and this species of fracture is called absolute elevation.
And the sign of these two fractures is great or small, and of fracture that is contracted or retracted; and the cause of it is the percussion with soft or hard objects, and to it they are similar.
And this fracture is penetrating, which already approaches the nerve which is left to the bone; or it is on the face of the bone, and the sign of these two fractures is great or small
And the fracture is that which is hidden in the bone, in the marrow of the small vein, and because of this it is called capillary fracture
And the fracture is caused by a blow or by a fall or by percussion of an object and to it they are similar, which makes any lamina of the bone enter into the parts surrounding it, and is found in the hollow part just as when it happens to the nails when they are struck by percussion and enter the surrounding parts
Mostly it happens in the bones of humors, as in the heads of nails
And all these traumatic fractures are like pieces of glass separated from each other And I command you to return everything to its place.
And I recognize all these signs of fracture for their detection on these parts and for their treatment, as well as the putrefaction that is on them.</end_of_turn>
And the capillary sign is known to help detect fractures, as it is excreted and limits itself on them, making the fracture visible.</end_of_turn
Moreover, in the treatment of fractures, attention must be paid to the pre-existing conditions of the patient, and if sometimes for the signs that indicate pain, such as vomiting of bile, extension, loss of consciousness, vomiting of blood, diarrhea, fever, acute jaundice, and even swelling of the joints and stiffness in those.
And if sometimes non-violent accidents happen, then you must begin the treatment of them.</end_of_turn>
The cause of which is that if it is provoked at the beginning like that which happens in the days of spring, then you must study the bone from the fourteenth day onwards according to all possibility.</end_of_turn>
And if it is in the summer days, then you must bandage the bone from the seventh day onwards, having understood that what is left of the bone will be putrefied from the marrow, and that you must take care of the accidents that we have recommended.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture has already reached the marrow covering the cerebellum, and is small and soft, then you must insert the small fragment and retract it, as I have recommended to you.</end_of_turn
And it is that you take hold of the patient's head, uncover the bone according to custom, and handle it as you deem best according to the appearance of the wound, and inquire about the patient's condition.</end_of_turn
And if you happen to see the fracture, flow of pus or soft eschar, then you must oppose yourself to them as much as you can and that you cover them with oil and vinegar, and apply pressure to the wound until the eschar is softened; and ensure the flow of pus; and then begin the circulation of the bone and its reduction.</end_of_turn
And this is according to two methods of operation.</end_of_turn
And one method is that you pierce the bone with a straight incision, and this is how you do it: And you administer another incision, a little wider than the first; and this is how you do it:
And you administer more of the latter incision than the former.</end_of_turn
And you must know the number of various incisions you have made, of which some are wider than others, and some are shorter than others and are at the back of the acuity of their extremities, and are made of iron or steel.</end_of_turn
And use them to facilitate the percussion on the incisions so that you do not break the head and damage the surrounding area.</end_of_turn
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must perforate in the circumference of it before administering the incisions, which are called superficial incisions.</end_of_turn
They are not called thus unless they do not stop the term of the bone from the test until it is close to the head of the bone appearing like a margin or small circle, which must not be immersed in liquid or pass the sharpness of the bone.</end_of_turn
It is convenient that you take a great number of these superficial incisions, which are appropriate for the sharpness of each bone, until in all tests of the cerebellum the limb that is acute is present, the quantity in length and breadth being according to the quantity of sharpness of this test.</end_of_turn
And this is the form of three species of incisions: The quality of perforating in the circumference of the broken bone is that you stop the incision on the bone and rotate it with the thumbs until you see that the bone is already pierced; and then you change the incision to another place and stop when there is no longer any thickness of the ray left.</end_of_turn
And finally, you must make incisions around the bone, and do so with such skill that you can lift it up as much as possible, as we have said, until you have removed the bone, or with your hand, or by any other cause that causes these tremors, such as nails and fine forceps.</end_of_turn
And you must take great care that the incision does not touch any part of the brain case.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when the bone is perforated by the urine and if the urine is continued to flow from it, that which is extracted must be covered, because it causes swelling and pain similar to that of an incision, although it is more severe and subtle than other incisions.
And if any small bones or fragments remain, it is necessary to facilitate this with the aid of urine; and in this way the wound will be healed with lichen and the surrounding area will be cleansed, as we have already said
And another method of treatment is light and long, which is called Galen and Lawrence for great pain; and this is its meaning: it is necessary at the beginning to uncover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most violent and obvious, until when you have uncovered that part and have stopped, the limb of this incision will recover slowly and peacefully as a result of this
For the lens-shaped part is soft and does not cause any other lesion, while the acute part is towards two sides of the length, as sometimes; that the lens-shaped part be adjusted to the bladder with the face of the acute incision on the bone.
And in this way pierce over the incision with a small mallet so that the bone is facilitated in this way as if it were rotated, and you must be sure that the bladder does not suffer any damage in this process, for which reason the physician must be the most learned of all men and the most ignorant of it. Certainly, if he was asleep.
And if there remains any accessory cause attached to the bone of the bladder in the vicinity of the bone, it will cause the limb of the incision to become painful in that part, and it will swell, which is to say that it swells without pain at night and without fear
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate the bladder, and what is exuded or remains of the bone is the face of the bone, and it remains in the swelling and subtle fragments, it is necessary to cover that swelling and eradicate those fragments subtly for the reasons for which you have prepared the number, in various quantities so that you can conveniently manage them in all places and more conveniently as you lose your operation in this bone that is fractured and its figure.
And cover that you administer in your ratio at the beginning of these treatments, and in this way use more of the soft pus, and do not cease doing so until you have administered the greatest and most subtle of all.
Moreover, in any other small fractures of capillaries and subtle fractures, cover that you administer with care as to the rectification of it
And it is known to all who have studied in this art. And thus much of what has been written above regarding great fractures has been shown to us
And if the bladder is rectangular when you have eradicated the bone, it is necessary to take a strip from it according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse that in olive oil, and put that over the orifice of the wound; and take another strip doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and olive oil and put that over the first one and do with the pus whatever it pleases you that can be done without injuring the bladder; and administer over that a little fat, and do not tighten that until the wound is only as large as the wound alone.
And leave that with this care for a day or two until you are sure that the wound has healed; and then remove that and administer medicines that are useful for swelling, such as linseed and oatmeal, and powder of alum and of surgery, and like those.
And make of these medicines a powder that is scattered over the wound, thus as they are dry; and in general, administer in that way all medicines of which you are aware that they have the property of being astringent and not corrosive.
Beware according to your skill that the wound in your care is flat; and do not put anything greasy on it; neither leave anything to swell it up; for when it is adjusted on the bladder of the brain, it corrupts that and weakens that, and brings about the sickness you wish to avoid in the patient
And take care that in the head there is no inflammation, as is often the case when the care is deficient, and that there is no blackness on the surface; and therefore consider that it is harmful to the patient to cause any accident to the bladder that we have mentioned, knowing that it is dangerous for him in every way
And if no blackness appears except from the medicine that is left out, and it is in virtue of that medicine that caused that blackness, then cover that you take less of that medicine and more of olive oil three parts, respectively And with these medicines apply a bandage, and put that over the bladder; and take care of that which is necessary for the treatment that you consider appropriate until it is healed

It is wise that the nose is not fractured but rather split into two equal parts, or one of them partially severed, so that there are two bones, of which one is cartilage and is not fractured, but is twisted and swollen.
Maybe if one of the two parts is fractured, then you must insert a little instrument into the nose and equalize that fracture as much as possible, and as much as the force permits, until the nose returns to its natural shape And it is done for you to facilitate this, and take care that you do not cause damage to the patient during this operation for pain
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and you say that it is not going to survive, then you must equate at the end of the ray where it is small.
And if the fracture is in two parts, you must do the same thing as before
Cover the restoration of the nose in the first day of the fracture, if possible; otherwise, keep it still for six days or until the swelling subsides
And insert into the extremity of the nose a wick of lead, if the fracture is in one part, or two cushions, if the fracture is in two parts, of such a size that it fills the cavity of the nose
I say to the ancient restorers that the cushions must be bound over, and must be changed throughout the day, even though I do not see it; because the wick must be embedded in albumin of blood with powdered meal; and keep the cushion in place until the bone is fixed and the cartilage is hardened
Some people put sponges instead of cushions, because it is better than covering it with lead; and that the fracture of the nose is already violent and that the patient should not be prohibited from inspiration
This is not necessary for you; and if you want, do it, and if you do not want, do not do it
And if another cushion comes away after the cautery, plaster the nose with beeswax or with fat soaked in vinegar and oil, or with diachronic.
Even if it does not come away after the cautery, you must plaster the outside with dough of the same size and with powdered gypsum with albumin of blood; and place your hand over the nose, and do not touch the nose in any way
If the bones of the nose are fractured with a small fracture or with cracks, you must cut over those, and extract those with instruments that are suitable for those; and close the wound, and care for that which encloses and consolidates, and plaster as necessary
If there is a wound inside the nose, you must care for that with cushions and give canulas of lead until it is completely healed

Restoration of the mandible when fractured.
When the jaw bone is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by bruising, keep it still only if the fracture is outside and not fractured in two parts and is slightly curved towards the parts adjacent to it. In this case, its sensitivity is weak
Therefore, if the fracture is in the right part, insert the left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is in the left mandible, insert the index finger of your right hand; and pull towards that side of the fracture so that the parts outside are slightly stretched, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; in this way you will equal the height of both parts
And if the fracture of the mandible is already separated into two parts, you must administer an extension of two parts according to the rule until the equality is possible
If there is displacement of teeth with disruption, strengthen those that you think will remain with gold or silver or ivory; and place a cerot plaster over the fractured mandible, and a duplicate plaster over the molar area, and a large gauze pad adequately sized over the bone; and tie that up as you please, as long as the application agrees with it, until it is not destroyed
Command the patient to rest and tranquility, and abstain from eating coarse foods that irritate the lips.
And if you see that the figure has already been altered in any way, cover that for the third day; and then rectify what has already been altered and plaster that with powdered gypsum, with albumin of blood, or with dough of barley, because you have already put the cerot on it, and keep it covered with a layer of wool
E adonc cum sta annex e ajustat aquel emplastre sobre lu, e la disposicio del os no es alterada, layssa aquel, que no le deslies entro que sia sanat e strenh la fractura; quar motas veguadas aquesta fractura es streyta en tres sempmanas.
And if another displacement occurs after the cautery, leave that which has been said until the patient is healed, and evacuate that after the fracture has healed.
If the fracture is soft, consider if it is a separated bone or a displacement; in this case you must order the evacuation of those displacements along with those that are causing the pain
If the wound opening is wide, expand it with the flebotomy according to the amount of the need
Then, when you have evacuated those displacements, if those remain, enlarge the wound opening; if not, place one of the dressings that you have previously recommended over that area and bind it up until it is healed

Chapter V.
A fracture of the collarbone is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body and pain occurs in the feet. This is customarily called gout by doctors.
Whether it is fractured or separated, or is separated into two parts without causing displacement; the restoration of it is desired; or if displacement has occurred, it is difficult to restore it; or if the fracture is soft
And in this operation, when the fracture is soft, two assistants should be present, one to support the fractured bone and the other to extend the limb to that part
Then wrap the fracture with strips until the limb regains its normal shape, without causing excessive tension or concavity
If more extension is needed, the doctor must suspend the patient's breathing by means of a sponge or cloth, and the extent of the procedure should be determined by the amount of the need; then extend and elevate the collarbone and cover the wound with your hand until the fracture is bound up according to the previous instructions
If the limb cannot be moved from the collarbone to the outside, because of excessive pain, the patient should be placed on his chest, and place a cushion under the muscle in the middle of the limb.
The assistants should support the limb from below until the collarbone bone is elevated above the level of the preon, and then rectify the fracture and wrap it up with strips
Even if there are displacement of the collarbone and they are bloody, cover that area and remove those displacements easily
If the fracture is retained in the bone, make an incision in the skin with one of the instruments that you have prepared, because you have previously stopped the pain of the fracture; this is the form of the instrument:
It is similar to a pliers of which this is the concavity; and its width should be determined according to the size of the bone or the thinness of the bone
The length should be such as to enable the operation; two extremities are required as many times as necessary, one broad and one narrow
If the disruption of the wound caused by the evacuation of the displacement from the bone is wide and if the cautery is secure, suture the two lips of the wound together
If the disruption is slight or if you fear the cautery, cover the wound with gauze and powder according to the extent of the wound opening
If there is further bleeding after the cautery, soak the wound in vinegar and oil and wine, and pause over it
And thus, even though the splinter has not pierced the bone, nevertheless, because of its pain, you must see the patient every day. For when the ligature is softened or the splinter has come out, the pain will cease and the ligature will be strengthened.
And so, having stopped the patient’s sleep on the bed, and having put a little cushion under their chin, let them sleep for a little while; for thus will the attendants be able to lift up the patient from the side, and so the fracture of the collarbone is raised by raising the muscle; or let the patient lie with their arm bound to their chest.
Do not remove the ligature unless an accident has occurred in the place where it was made, within twelve days.
And so, renew the dressing if you have seen the face of the limb to that which it pertains, and tighten the dressing and restore that which was taken away when the fracture of the collarbone is restored.
And it is strengthened and comforted according to the month in eighty days, and some walks in various homes is useful in a month’s time of that.

Treatment for a Fractured Collarbone.
The splinter has pierced the side of the limb and is not pierced through the bone except for the margins
And thus, when the limb is fractured – and it is fractured in the middle of the bone – and it is not known except by touch, the hour is that according to the figure of the fracture you must prepare the limb and reduce that according to the natural figure in every way that you can manage.
And so, put a powder of meal over the fracture of bone, and stop the bleeding with sponge; and sprinkle over it a little powder of beeswax; and put over it a staple of wood as much as a little more
Or if the staple has been left concave in some parts of the area of the spatula, the hour is to fill that concavity with sponge, and to support the staple equally
And so, keep the limb bound with a long bandage with a descending constriction and with a firming of the staple until it is remauged from the bone.
Consider the ligature every day; and when it is softened, bind another one and tighten it and equal the staple if it is remauged from the bone
And I put the patient on the side of the bed
The splinter is restored in xx days or in .xxv
And thus, when this number is completed, the hour is to dissolve the ligature, and you know that from the bones from which it began neither fear nor their dissolution is to be had
And if you proceed from the place of the bone of the heel and leave the cord, the hour is to cut over it, and hold it, and do as has been said in the fracture of the collarbone in the event of an accident here

Treatment for a Fractured Foot
The foot has some veins that are fractured in the middle of the bone and these are to be stopped; but the extremities of the limb must be kept clean and diminished
And with regard to the accidents of the limb when the middle is fractured, that it declines to the lower parts and causes great pain, difficulty in walking, and vomiting and fainting; and is declared in the cavity of the fractured bone and is not hidden from the feeling.
And the restoration of the limb is that you rest the patient on the two sides, and put between the ankles of the limb a cushion; and press on the muscles of the limb, and adjust the ribs of the limb to the greatest of two ribs, and lift up the limb in the operation and in the equalization as much as is possible and convenient, until the limb returns to its natural figure
And so, put over the dressing and sponge and stop over the staple a cushion of soft gauze or cloth and keep it in suspension; and cover that with a bandage; and tightly bind that over the fractured bone that it is not too tight; and gradually strengthen that which is in tension every hour, and when it is softened strengthen that again
And if necessary, if there is swelling, bruising, pain, or swelling that occurs in the place, the hour is to stop and remove that, and remove the dressing and rectify what has occurred for what is convenient for the treatment; and then reduce the dressing, sometimes to that extent; and adjust the tension so that it is healthy

Be wise that the fracture of the bowels does not crack only in the joints but also in empty spaces that follow one another; and from the extremities of them towards the front it does not happen except by that which is cartilaginous. And recognize it is not hidden by the feeling of them so that you inquire of them what they say
And the restoration is thus that it embraces the fracture as they say in the manner that is possible, except that it embraces as much as it covers, and then apply plaster and bind the broken bone with a star, if you wish of that
And if the fracture of the bowels is declining towards the thighs, then at the same time it happens to the patient acute pain and puncture, just like a puncture that happens to that one who has pleurisy, and for that which the bone is put under pressure; and it happens with difficulty of digestion, and all these things, and vomiting without any cause; and this is of difficult healing
And already the ancients have devised in this way that it does not endure.
And thus they say: cover that you stop feeding the patient who brings about inflammation and swelling, because the belly is swollen and extended, and the fracture is impeded from the parts outwards
May we be aware of that so that it is not the cause of a greater lesion, if not to happen; and if it has already happened, then it is of help to it
And I say of them that it should be stopped from its violence and that you should succeed with firmness; and it is like reasoning, however, it is feared that the violence pulls out the superfluities from the place for the fracture
And I say of them: cover that the place be covered with a bandage that is already immersed in hot oil, and remain suspended between the joints until it is full; that the ligature be equal when it encloses that according to its roundness; and thus be cured the patient with the care of food and medicine.
And if it causes acute constriction to the patient which does not suffer from it, and if the bone is put under pressure with a puncture wound, remember about the patient, for it is necessary to uncover the fractured bone, uncover the broken coast, and then take away that instrument which holds the intestines, remembering that it is preceded by the memory of that, and that it facilitates the bone, and extract that.
And thus we must adjust the two lips of the wound, if it is great, with stitching, and care for that which is done with plaster until it is healed
And if there happens to be swelling in the thighs, then you should cover and immerse in oil the foot and pause over the place, and that the patient be cured with that which covers the swelling in the thighs.
And rest upon the side on which you sleep until it is healed

Of the restoration of the fracture of the vertebra of the thigh and the pelvis.
Some veins cause fracture to the bones of the pelvis, and they attach to them, and it is similar to the vertebrae of the thigh And when this happens to some of them and you want to know if it is healed or not, then consider that sometimes the veins are more swollen and hardened and stiff and dead and you cannot make them bend or extend or strengthen them and when you constrain them with the thighs they say or prick them with a needle and they do not feel any pain, then you know that it is not healed, and in this way it is mortal.
And if you do that and feel in that constriction with the thighs they say and prick with a needle, then you know that the bone marrow is saved and that the patient will recover with care
And if you see the vertebrae of the thigh like that and you want to know if it is healed or not, then consider the weight of them
Then sometimes when they are already softened, it happens to them that which is usual in the greatest, and you must know when you sit upon the two thighs, there is a breeze and egestion of urine that is not voluntary, and some veins are resting upon the two thighs and they cannot urinate and cannot sit, then you know that it is mortal, and do not work in the care of them
And if no other cause is caused by this, the cause is better and lighter
And the care of them is that you perforate with a needle at the relaxation of the swelling that rests upon the fractured vertebra, and pour over it hot oil or cold packs of blood; and pause over that each vein gives blood until the swelling of the heel is relaxed.
And thus pause one of the comforting and existing plasters, and rest upon that limb; and command the patient to rest calmly and not sleep on the side where he finds pain until he is healed.
And if it happens that the cartilage of the heel or any other cause has already been separated from it, then order that the heel be dissected and that bone be retained; and then suture the two lips of the wound, if necessary; and care for that limb until it is healed.
May be if the heel bone is fractured at the ankle and is at the end of the limb, then order that you place your left hand over the heel and grasp the fractured bone with the other hand as much as is possible; and then support the plaster and bandage, if necessary, and strengthen that limb
And if the heel bone is fractured in its place, then rest upon that limb and retain that bone; and care for the wound with the usual care until it is healed
Chapter ten.
On the restoration of the limb.
The bones of the thighs are sometimes fractured and if they fracture, then the fracture of them is only communication in the extremities of those and are inscribed in the length and decline towards the parts downwards; and it happens to the patient pain in the area and puncture, and the limb is stupefied when fractured
And the restoration of them is that you extend your hand over that which is over the fracture which is the figure of it.
And if the fracture is only in the extremity of the limb, then grasp that as much as is possible according to the proportion that is appropriate until it is reassembled to its natural figure
Or if the fracture is in the length or that it already declines towards the parts downwards, then order the patient to lie over the belly until it is prepared for you the restoration of that fracture And when it has been grasped, pause over the plaster and then pause over the bandage of the ankle or heel, and strengthen by stricture over which you do not fear puncture of the fracture or loosening of the staple
And grasp the hollow with what is under that which supports that in that which it rests according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on the belly or rest on the side of his chest
Or if aftercare burns, then cease the extension and restoration of that limb until the aftercare burn has subsided, and pause over that which remains according to that which is preceding; and then return to the restoration of that limb, and strengthen that limb as before
Or if it happens in the heel bone or they are crushed, then treat them
Chapter eleven.
On the restoration of the fracture of the adductor muscle
The adductor is that which is between the hip joint and the head of the femur
And if it is fractured, the restoration of it is in two ways, of which is to grasp the great trochanter with the hand and press it inwards with the other hand according to this fashion:
And there are two ligaments in two extremities, and it is suspended from the elevated area
And follow the patient on a cushion; and then pull out the fractured limb over the thigh until it reaches the tilt of the thigh of which it is an annex of the curvature of the thigh
And if there is any serious cause, or if the limb is extended to the parts downwards; and the physician should place the fracture on the sides more firmly, until the fracture returns as it should
And the other way is that the patient be supine on the cervical spine and suspend the hand of the hip over the limb; and command two assistants that one of them hold that which is below the fracture on his sides; and the other hold his legs; and each of them extend to his side
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then strengthen over the fracture on the ligament and over that on the other ligament, and each of the two assistants extend their two sides
And if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, then order that half of the ligament be fixed over the tilt and the other half over the fracture beyond the hip joint
Likewise if the fracture is near the hip joint, then order that the ligament be fixed over that area and over that hip joint
The swelling that facilitates the work and is applied when necessary, and as much as it is applied correctly, the hour that sustains that which does not happen after the burn.
If after the burn the swelling persists, leave it loose for seven days, and suspend the lancet in cold vinegar and olive oil until the burn subsides, and then resume the burn.
And the way to sustain the burn that is to place a compress over the fracture, and then put on a bandage over the compress; and then adjust the arm on that support, and put your hand over the buttock muscle
Then suspend the limb and sustain the arm on the support so that the arm is in its place, if you do not prevent any cause of fracture.
And the hour uses supports.
And it is that you suspend the fracture with a strap that is thicker and stronger than the others; and suspend between each strap the width of a finger, and the length of the strap according to the fracture plus three fingers from the root
And then sustain the straps at the fracture which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And that your support over the area of the fracture is tighter.<end_turn> And when the fracture is longer, the support should be smaller.<end_turn>
And thus if sometimes the position of the straps and the support are as we have said at the hour when you restore the limb to its normal position, then do so.<end_turn>
And if you fear a burn, then leave the support and straps loose for seven days as we have said.<end_turn>
And consider the ligament in all its parts for three days so that it does not happen at the place of the fracture or swelling; or that the diet be forbidden to the limb to prevent surplus of support; and therefore rectify everything as we have said.<end_turn
And if you are confident that no cause of this has occurred, do not remove the bandage for three days or more.<end_turn
And let the patient rest quietly on the bed, and the attendants sit beside the patient's stomach.
And suspend on the support cooked with full broth, and consider at every hour of the night or day that it is not deformed or dissolved the figure of the fractured limb, or that the ligament is softened, therefore rectify all this with your skill.
And suspend the diet of the patient according to the order that we have given before, namely that the diet be bland at the beginning until it is strengthened; and the hour cover that you remove the coarse food from them
As for the use of the support and the change of the limb is that they should be strengthened for forty days; and the hour cover that they are removed and that warm bath and medicine be administered with the things that rectify this.<end_turn>
And if the fracture is delayed, the hour does not remove the ligament and the straps until a day or two months have passed.<end_turn

Of the restoration of the fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two knuckles; of which one is small, which is that which is between the thumb, and the other is large, which is that which is fixed beyond the thumb, from the part beyond the thumb.<end_turn
And it is strong if only the large knuckle is fractured, or the small, and it is strong if both are fractured together.<end_turn
And when the small knuckle is fractured, the restoration of it is light, and the healing is easier.<end_turn
And when the large knuckle is fractured behind the thumb, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult.<end_turn
And the worst of all is when both bones are fractured together.<end_turn
Therefore if the bone that is fractured is the small one outside, the doctor must be convenient to restore it, that is, to keep it slightly extended until it is healed.<end_turn
And if the large knuckle is fractured, the hour covers that you pause the extension more violently.
And if both bones are fractured together, the hour covers that you must pause the extraction as little as possible.<end_turn
And keep the figure of the hand still during the restoration of the limb and its extension over a cushion, and let the palm of the hand rest on the parts below, rather than on all the others, and say the word "auriga" lower than the others, and the patient should be placed on a fallen cushion.
And let there be a cushion under the limb at its height or below, so that the patient does not strain themselves.</end_of_turn>
Then extend the arms of the attendants beyond the shoulders towards the sides, and another attendant extends his arms in a similar fashion.</end_of_turn>
Then the doctor should grasp the bone and reduce it according to the better figure that can be made.</end_of_turn
And if there is swelling in the bone, the hour perforates to reduce the whole foot in the ankle with your art.</end_of_turn
And if there appears a separated swelling that you do not hope will be restored, the hour will leave it there according to the manner we have said above.</end_of_turn>
May be the fracture is blunt, and I have already done what is necessary in this matter, and therefore take care of that.</end_of_turn>
And if during the commencement of the restoration an ulcer appears, the hour will anoint a the surface with olive oil and white wax, and let it be more between severity and gentleness, and strengthen the dressing over that which is strict and painful until the ulcer has subsided; and the hour remains with the dressing and pauses the plaster prepared from powdered millet with lime, and let it rest; and let the support be placed over that fracture more firm and strong.</end_of_turn
And you know that the number of supports for the limb is seen in the greatest availability, or that the fracture is in a basin or in two basins together.</end_of_turn
Then pause the bandage firmly over the fracture site until more flexible and when more downwards from the fracture or from the lower parts, pause the bandage a little more moist according to the recollection of its beginning.</end_of_turn
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be moist cloths, neither too soft nor too rough, and the thread with which it is bound should be neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have recommended.</end_of_turn
Consider the limb and the ligament for several days.</end_of_turn And if any cause occurs which requires rectification, as soon as possible as the cause which occurred to the limb, and the hour covers that you immerse the limb in cold water until the cause has ceased.</end_of_turn
And keep the limb from straining until it has recovered, and then remove the bandage.</end_of_turn
And if the swelling is already softened and the bone is already healed and appears as before, the hour will rectify everything with his skill.</end_of_turn
And consider if the nourishment is prohibited from reaching the limb due to excessive binding, for the hour covers that you soften that a little and leave it for several days until it runs out of that nourishment, and strengthen that.</end_of_turn
And if no other cause of those mentioned above occurs in the patient, the hour does not cover that it should be discharged within approximately twenty days or so.</end_of_turn
And let the patient suspend their hand for the movement of their ailment, and make them sleep on the side two.</end_of_turn
And you know that this fracture is usually restored in xxx days or in xxxii days, or that the convalescence is usually completed in xxviii days, according to the condition of the complications and the ability of the skill.</end_of_turn

On the restoration of the fracture of the thumb and the fingers.</end_of_turn>
You know that in the thumb and the fingers there is a fracture, and it does not happen to them except for soft swellings.</end_of_turn
And when there is a fracture or tearing to the thumb, the hour covers that the patient should continue to lie down and keep their limb still according to equality, and let the hand rest over that which is extended.</end_of_turn
Then the attendants extend the broken bones and the doctor grasps them until they are congruent with good union.</end_of_turn
And the hour covers that you stop the plaster and the bandage, if there is no ulcer; and let the support be placed over the area according to the quantity of the limb, and you have already covered that with a bandage.</end_of_turn
May be if the fracture is in the thumb, you must hold the belly of the palm, and when you do so, hope that the patient will stretch that which is fractured; then strengthen it with a long strap.
And if the limb is elevated on the palm of the hand, then let the limb be applied to the palm; and stretch it as much as covers.
May be if the fracture is at the outer part, then pause one limb at the outer part of the palm and the other limb at the inner part of the palm, so that the hand is opened and closed; and then loosen the tension, as if you were rotating the hand between the thumbs and little fingers
And if it happens that the fracture is on one of the knuckles of the fingers, then it is called pus; let it be supported as much as covers and strengthen it with the palm of the hand, and if you wish, place a bandage around the little finger to elevate the fracture and prevent bruising.
May be if the fracture is on the index finger, middle finger, ring finger, or little finger, then let it be supported and bound with the finger to which it pertains; or bind them all together continuously, which is better; or place a bandage over that little finger, as we said in the case of pus
Consider and take into account, in your restoration, and oppose — with your skillful operation — whatever may cause these, as it is repeated in the narration of the case.

On the restoration of the fracture of the thigh bone.</start_of_turn
The thigh bone, when fractured, moves and is declared to be complete according to the sensation as it is converted to the proximal part and to the sovereign pus.</start_of_turn
And the restoration is done in this way that the ligament is strengthened over the fracture and another ligament leaves the fracture, and the patient is placed prone on the belly and on the face.</start_of_turn
And the minister extends all the ligament to its quality according to the quality, when the fracture is in the middle part of the bone.</start_of_turn
May be if it is close to the thigh, then let the ligament be close to the nail at the base of the thumb, so that the extension is on the outside, and the other ligament leaves the fracture.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is close to the nail, then let the ligament be close to the nail, and the extension be to the outside.</start_of_turn
And the physician should bite the bone on both sides more than he reduces it according to the natural conformation; the bone is joined together by a good connection; the hours cover that the plaster and tension are paused, if it does not happen to the limb after the restoration.</start_of_turn May be if it happens in the restoration, the hours lay aside that for a few days until the cautering plaster has softened, and then return to your care.</start_of_turn
The tension of the limb is also sufficient: cover the fracture with a hard bandage, and bend it two or three times, and remove its excess; and then cover the wound until it reaches the hip and the base of the thigh.</start_of_turn
And inside long faithfully between the thigh and the wound near the nail of the outside, and the veins of the ligament of the pus-sovereign parts, and the minister revolves around the wound and the thigh as much as the excess of the bandage.</start_of_turn
And then pause over the thigh in the place of that fracture, and pause two nails on the bone of the limb.</start_of_turn
And finally fill the voids between the limb and the thigh with soft cloths, so that the tension is coagulated.</start_of_turn
And finally start to bind firmly from the middle over the place of the fracture with three wraps or four, and when you have arrived at the ligament of the place of the fracture, your bind is less and lighter and softer.</start_of_turn
And extend two ends of the bandage to the outside until it reaches the ankle, and strengthen both ends of the nails of the other side so that the ligament is not stretched from the hip.</start_of_turn
And finally leave the tension on that, so that it does not happen to the limb crookedness or cautering or swelling and remains as it should; and if anything of those should happen, then immediately take it out and rectify what has happened in every way, as we have said many times.</start_of_turn
May it be that if the bone is painful to the touch, then you must embrace that part as much as is possible; otherwise, leave it and remain with that, and care for that from which the memory precedes until it is healed.

Treatment for the fracture of the forearm.</end_of_turn
Know that in the forearm there are two bones, of which one is thick, and is called the radius; and the other is slender, and is called the ulna.</end_of_turn
And there are various kinds of fractures of these bones, just as there are in the arms, and for that reason the restoration of them is as much as the restoration of the arm itself, and the operation is one.</end_of_turn
And if both bones are fractured together, the forearm is converted into all parts.</end_of_turn
And if only the slender bone is fractured, the forearm is converted to the parts surrounding it.</end_of_turn
And if only the thick bone is fractured, the other limb must be left, and this is from those causes that you are not aware of.</end_of_turn
And provide extension, equalization and ligation of the bones according to that healing.</end_of_turn
However, if the fracture of the forearm is slight without having great swelling, that the extension should be more gentle and less laborious, and rely on your virtue.</end>
And in the forearm there is any reason for an operation on the arm, and that is when you embrace the limb and when you have completed all the work of the operation, then you will take away the cause of the pain; align those that are requested to be aligned, and do not be afraid of the hands, and make them as long as the forearm and as much as the elbow allows.</end>
And put on a bandage over any wound in two layers according to the length of it, and support one over the part of the forearm from one side and the other from the other side, and from the elbow to the wrist.</end><end_turn>
And secure the two bones in three places at two extremities and in the middle part, so that the structure of the forearm is prohibited from bending to the right and left, and remains in a good position.</end><end_turn><end_turn>

Chapter XVII. Of fractures of the ankle and the bones of the foot and toes.</end_of_turn>
The ankle does not often suffer fracture; but in the foot bones some fractures are frequent; and in the toes little fracture occurs, and it does not occur in them except in cases of violent injury.</end_of_turn
And if there is fracture in the bones of the foot, and sometimes these bones must be elevated among themselves, then prepare the earth under the foot and put the foot down gently as you go.</end_of_turn
Then put a hand over that which is elevated of those bones, and put on shoes, and hold firmly, and keep them together until they return to their place.</end_of_turn
And put on a bandage and hold still, and keep the foot covered with a small table on which are two cushions.</end_of_turn
And keep the foot stretched out as much as you can, because you have wrapped up the area with cloth and other things which you must not neglect.</end_of_turn
And when three or four days have passed, then you will loosen the ligaments, because you will find that the bones are healed, or fractured or dislocated, and the operation in these cases is as dangerous as it is useful.</end>
But if some of the toes are fractured, then restore them, and bandage them as before. Recommend that you rest the hand.</end> And keep the fractured toe still according to the length of the toe, and do not put on shoes for a while. Keep the foot on the table that has been recommended to you, and keep the foot stretched out.</end
And if two or three or more bones are fractured, then keep your hand still over each toe as much as its covering in linen allows, and keep the foot firmly on the table, resting on one of the feet of the table under the foot so that it has good support.</end
It is convenient for you to know that we have not mentioned all the causes of these fractures; and avoid any other accident which may occur to you.</end>

Of fractures of the knee of the femur and the patella bone and the groove of the heel.</end_of_turn
When the knee of the femur is fractured, then cease in this case the fall which has caused it, and incline that towards the two a little, and keep it from behind.</end_of_turn
And put on the cushion and fill the knee with cotton, and make a point on the knee of it as expected; and elevate the two small bones little by little, so that everything that is outside is forgotten until the part of the knee which has been fractured returns.</end_of_turn
And keep powdered over the two of them, and when you finish urinating loosen the cushion somewhat so that the knee is facilitated and put on shoes, and reduce and return that as soon as possible according to the manner in which it was at the beginning, and keep the powdered foot again.</end_of_turn
And do the same for seven days or more, until it is restored.</end_of_turn
Or if you wish, take once a sponge and stretch over the knee a tube of silk; and put the whole sponge into the knee, and then put on a bandage over the tube as before until the sponge is swollen inside the knee, which will make the fracture return.</end_of_turn
And keep the cushion on the knee and rest it for two or three days as we have recommended, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And when the patella bone of the knee or the femur bone is fractured, then administer in the restoration and recovery of them as we have recommended in the ankle bone.</start_of_turn
And that which is hidden in these principal fractures does not appear, more especially to him who studies and uses this book well; for that fracture signifies to you in the greatest possibilities of recovery in the restoration and in the stiffness of them, and therefore understand well.</start_of_turn
But if the heel bone is fractured, take hold of the ankle with one hand and the heel with the other hand; and put the heel on that. And keep the bandage over it tightly, and keep it bound for three days or more, and it will be healed.</start_of_turn

Convenient is he to whom the fracture has happened with swelling, and more so if the bone is great as, for example, the thigh bone or the fibula, or in a similar way, that you may keep him still and prevent him from moving so much as if the conditions of inflammation allow or as much as they have been said.
And if the swelling subsides, then cover that you may retain them inside without causing them to become powdered, if for another reason this is not present
Then begin to restore the fracture in that same day, and do not prolong it, if not after the swelling has subsided
Maybe if swelling subsides later, leave the restoration of the fracture until the swelling has gone down, and do not approach it on the third day or the fourth, for you will cause other accidents.
Maybe if the broken bone is prominent on the edge of the wound, cover that you must perforate to reduce that and equalize that with the rest as easily and with little extension
Maybe if the extension is not as you have prepared and the equalization is not with the thighs, then reduce that with your hands as much as this discomfort; and this discomfort is useful, for its length is seven or eight inches and its width according to the quantity of swelling; and for this reason the doctor must take precautions for these three or four according to the quantity that you indicate for the care of the fracture in general
And be round, and be in little thickness so that it is not bent backwards from the pressure during the operation
And be at the acute end to which is margin at the ankles; and be that of it from the greatest to the least extent, and from the middle to the margins
And this is the way to do it:
And it is called in Greek “labre volentz atelarem”, so it is a little pale
For that it must be suspended the acute limb elevated over the limb of the prominent bone
And put it in a groove until the bone returns, and be equalized with any equalization
And therefore strive to equalize the extremities of the fracture between them, and if the fractured limb is flexible, and you do not take that discomfort for good acceptance, then cover that you insert the limb of that bone until the instrument has the power to do so.
Maybe if you cannot reduce the bone completely as we have recommended, then cover that with what covers the surgeons whom we have mentioned; or saw that with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you
And cover that which remains in the bone of asperility and of small scales.
And when the bone is reduced, and when the patient finds acute pain when the fracture is reduced, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do what you can to comfort the patient greatly
When your restoration is finished which you do to the bone, then immerse the limb in black styptic, and properly if it is in summer, and do not put oil over the swelling or any other cause in which there is oil, for this will cause it to soften and decay
And immediately after administering them give stars in the hour of the meal complementary to the restoration of the bone, and leave the swelling uncovered outside that you insert the needle with forceps and use of bandages according to the quantity of the swelling
And be very careful that you do not tear the swelling with the fracture, because many doctors have seen that this causes them to go blind or to become paralyzed, or to cause them to go mad, so it is good that it is healed well.</start_of_turn> And if the limb is flexible, soft, unlike the stricture of other fractures
And if the swelling is great or is bad swelling, and you fear about that accident which we have recommended, and if there is pain in the area, then do not put on that plaster, but make a bandage of coarse cloth in the place of needles and tighten it up well.</start_of_turn>
And when a couple of days have passed, since the swelling has begun to subside, put on a brace, then remove the bandage which you had put over that with wine, and immediately administer calamine, in the way that we usually do for swelling, as well as tetracycline and following the same procedure.</start_of_turn
Prepare the limb and consider the swelling in every morning and evening until it is consolidated and stopped, and make sure that the limb is prepared in such a way that the purulence will flow from it to the lower parts easily.
If the swelling persists for several days and is neither consolidated nor drained, then it is known that there is stagnation of the small humors, causing the swelling to extend further.</end_of_turn> And from those stagnations those which are separated remain and are extracted, those which are not separated remain and cause the limb to swell and cause pain, perforate me to incide these according to what is possible.</end_of_turn>
And if the swelling becomes black or green, it is stasis, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to suspend treatment until the cause has been explained in the preceding chapter.</end_of_turn
And in which case you must be silent and your face present your foot: when it is swollen like a walnut, inspect the limb as well as the cushion and the attendant, and remain like those of the great limbs, and do not presume its attraction, nor its extraction which may cause death; leave it alone until it softens, for it will fall down by itself within about twenty days or thirty days.</end_of_turn And the treatment will cure the swelling if you see it, and if not, leave it alone.</end_of_turn>
Chapter twenty.</end_of_turn>
Of the treatment of swelling that occurs in the aftermath of any fracture.</end_of_turn>
These swellings often occur after the healing of a fracture, and are especially common around the joints. They impede the natural function of the limb.</end_of_turn
Consider whether the swelling is recent and administer such medicines as have been shown to be effective against this when pure, or aloes, or acacia, and observe, and see if there is any redness or heat, and remain like those who have taken some or all of these, and when you have given them, cover the swelling with something soft and compress it firmly.</end_of_turn
Leave the extraction until more days have passed; and when you have extracted it, repeat it until the swelling has gone down; or stretch over that lamina of lead downwards, for lead has the property of healing all that is swollen in the limbs.</end_of_turn
Even if the swelling has already become hardened and hardened, and stretching is necessary, it is necessary to perform the incision cautiously, and remove the superabundance, or cut off the excess, until the hardness has gone down; and care for the wound until it has healed.</end_of_turn

Of the restoration of a fracture when it has healed and how to restore the limb to its natural function afterwards.</end>
When a bone fracture has healed, and the limb is still stiff and painful, several causes are possible: the stiffness of the ligaments has not been completely overcome; or there is excessive tightening of the ligaments, preventing nutrition from reaching the limb; or there is excessive swelling; or movement is not performed at the right time; or there is insufficient healing in the body and weakness in the limb.</end_of_turn
The treatment for this is to give the patient food and make them drink, to massage the limb to make them tender, and to give them baths; and to remove any discomfort or pain.</end_of_turn
And keep the limb still for a while, so that the nourishment can reach it, or continue to bandage the limb with cold water, until the nourishment returns to its normal position.</end_of_turn
Chapter twenty-two.</end_of_turn
Of the treatment of fractured bones when they have been restored and the prevention of their operation by any means that cover them.</end_of_turn
When a fractured limb has already healed somewhat, and there is still some twisting and prominence of the fractured bone and swelling, do not prohibit the limb from its natural movement, for otherwise you may cause greater damage to the limb.</end_of_turn
However, many foolish doctors and healers have done great harm in this matter; and this operation is extremely dangerous and often fatal.</end_of_turn
If the swelling and bruising are recent, cover them with cold water in which there are many emollient herbs, such as chamomile and gentian, meadowsweet, and the like; or apply soft plaster with gentle traction as well as possible; or take fragments of gentian with oil of cedar or olive oil, and mix them; or take figs and grind them with the colander of a woman, and mix them with the medicines that are not harmful after consolidation.</end_of_turn
Every day, when the body is rubbed with a lukewarm oil, and movement is administered to all parts at all hours, the swelling will gradually disappear.
Even if stiffness has already departed and a strong pain remains, it is necessary to take care of it with iron, because that which is excessive from nodule of that medicine to the bones becomes subtile, and it is facilitated in that way which is requested and studied.</end_of_turn>

About the disease of dislocation.</end_of_turn>
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint of the limb, which is prohibited from movement, and is accompanied by the figure of the limb, and causes pain and great damage.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when an accident of dislocation occurs, it is necessary to perforate as soon as possible so that it is reduced, and do not delay its reduction, because if it is delayed, the limb is swollen and strong, which makes it difficult to reduce the dislocation.</end_of_turn
And to help, do not grasp or stretch during the reduction, because the muscles become rigid and cause spasms and pain.</end_of_turn
When this happens, cover the patient's face with a cloth, and immediately place it within so that rest is restored; and embrace the limb with warm water and oil, and reduce it with ease.</end_of_turn
And all the limb must be treated with the water from which the memory will remain in its limb.</end_of_turn
And I have already ordered the chapters of dislocation according to their order, from the most serious part of the body inwards towards the less serious.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXIIIV.</end_of_turn
About the treatment of dislocation of the jawbone.</end_of_turn
So displaced are both mandibles if they are not promptly treated; and the dislocation of both is considered to be beneficial in two ways: that either they are loosely fixed in their places for little movement, or they are simply softened. Or they are completely dislocated and complicated, until they are softened at the junction of the joint, and saliva from the patient's mouth flows between them and they cannot open their mouth or close it, and their tongue is wrapped in their word.</end>
When the dislocation is slight, it is enough to return to its place by itself without any cause.</end_of_turn
When the dislocation is complete and complicated, it is necessary to administer its reduction urgently, and do not delay it at all.</end_of_turn
And the minister has the head of the patient, and the doctor puts his finger of the thumb of one hand on the root of the dislocation of the jaw that is towards the mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he puts two fingers together on the two roots, if the dislocation is on two sides, and the others say of the rest of them that they are outside those that bite; and commands the patient to stop his jaws and release those that bite; and the doctor bites the jaw and closes the jaw until it returns to its place.</end_of_turn
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both mandibles are simultaneously displaced, it is necessary to administer evaporation with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both is achieved and the reduction of both is not delayed, even if we have said it.</end_of_turn
And when they return and are softened, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, the doctor pauses over those little hairs in the beard at the corners, and it is beneficial to apply wax and oil to the gums. And embrace with ease.</end_of_turn
And the patient's sleep on the two sides, the head is placed between two cushions, so that neither side is hurt; and do not force him to bite for any reason; have the limb well nourished, except when the pains have subsided and the jaws are relaxed, the hour may order that he drink.</end_of_turn
And it is administered with ease, and do not work on the opening of the patient's mouth during eating and drinking and talking, until the jaw is healed and restored.</end_of_turn
And if the reduction of two mandibles is difficult when they are displaced at any hour and are not converted into their normal positions, the hour must immediately administer fever and continuous soda, and is highly recommended to irritate the patient's stomach, and to vomit pure bile.</end_of_turn
And whenever this happens, it is known that it is a dangerous thing; for many have perished from that which has befallen them within a few days.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the furcula and the extremity of the muscle.
The furcula is not displaced from the inside towards the outside by its continuity to the feet; and sometimes it is displaced towards the outside, and this is recognized by the feeling
And the restoration of it is that the patient grasps over the two buttocks and extends the two buttocks. And immediately support the area with your palm with strong pressure, so that it returns.
And immediately place your hand over that plaster and powder and tighten that
May the extremity of that which has suffered the colicky pain and has continued with that, not be displaced in any day; for it must be reduced and maintained as we have said and as you have observed
And immediately place your hand over that plaster, powder, and tightening, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And in this way the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from the bony area
End of document
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle
You know that the muscle is not displaced except in three ways, of which one is that it is displaced from the upper part towards the lower part
The second is that it is displaced from below the muscle, and that is good; it is not displaced from behind by the scapula; and it is not displaced from in front by the nerves
Most frequently it is displaced outwards from the lower part towards the titillic, and especially in those in whom the flesh is little, inasmuch as it is easily displaced; but in those in whom there is much flesh, it is difficult to displace it outwards
And frequently it happens to some people because of percussion or falling, and the muscle of them is loosened by the cautery, and is healed in that way that it has already been displaced
Therefore you must know when you are finished with it, and then proceed with the treatment of it
And it is known that the dislocation of the muscle is when it is towards the lower part towards the titillic; so that you distinguish between the displaced muscle and the sound muscle, for you will find among these various manifestations; and you will find on the head of the muscle a concavity and towards the titillic behind the touch of the head of the muscle as if there were a hole, and the patient is not able to reduce his hand to the navel, or to move it in any way
If it is displaced from below or from above, and you find the touch manifested, and it is not hidden.
And from this dislocation is useful the gentle reduction when it is fresh and the patient is young
The reduction of it is that the minister raises the hand of the patient above the lower part; and immediately place the thumbs behind the titillic of the patient, and raise the joint with strength at the level of the navel, and the minister raises the hand and extends that one; and immediately place that one back so that it returns gently
May it be that although we have said that it does not return, nevertheless from the beginning that the dislocation occurred, for several days, the patient must be bathed in lukewarm water and be administered embrocation that softens and soothes just like if it were ointment, and fennel, and melilot in water, and be administered.
And immediately the patient must be placed on his side and be held down from the titillic of the patient until the swelling has gone down between the levitation and the tension, and the physician immediately places the thigh against the hip, and raises the head of the muscle with force, and the minister holds the hand of the patient so that it is not bruised towards the lower parts, and another minister has the head of the patient, that it is not bruised towards the lower parts, for that much pain returns to the navel
Or if you wish, you can reduce it in this way: make sure that you have another person who is longer than the patient present on that side, and that he is between the thigh and the muscle of the patient, and insert the thigh of the patient behind the titillic of the patient and elevate the titillic to the lower part until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the hand of the patient from the lower parts of the abdomen If the patient is obstinate, know that other causes must be suspended, so that the greatest may remain, for the dislocation will return immediately.
It is reduced immediately in another way: let a long staff remain fixed on the ground, rounded at one end like a mortar pestle, which should not be thick or thin, and place the patient upon it; for when you place your hand over the head of the staff, the patient is stable according to the length of the staff, and extend your hand to the sides of the other part; extend the limb of the patient from the other side with strength, so that the joint returns to its proper place with speed.
And if it is difficult to reduce it by all the causes that we have said, then use this remedy: take a staff the length of two brasses, and the width of four fingers, and the thickness of it should be relieved in the crease of the buttocks in this manner:
And place over the rounded head some leather straps to prevent the staff from injuring the patient.
And place your hand or arm over the buttocks of the patient, and extend your hand or arms over the staff up to the sides, and tie the staff to the adjutors and the arms and the extremity of the hand.
Then place your arms on a step according to the width, and extend your hand to the sides, and the other limb should be suspended from the other side, so that the joint is inside immediately.
And when the limb is inside according to some manner that you deem possible, and when you have paused behind the buttocks for an amount equal to the quantity of wool; then pause with prepared plaster of powder of malt and alum of lead over all the muscles, so that it is rotated away from the bone, and strengthen behind the buttocks with tight tension; and the ligament should be rotated over the plaster, and the hand should be fixed to the limb, and be allowed to rest, and do not move the hand for seven days.
And know that the patient should be fed little, until the limb is comfortable, for it is more likely to heal the limb.
And give the food more frequently every seven or eight days, or let them do some movement; and thus if it is stopped and not softened, the hour has already healed.
However if the joint is dislocated slightly from moisture that happens to it, or from another cause, know that it must be cauterized with three prongs, as it is said in the chapter of cautery.
And if all this has been done and seven days have passed, the ligament is detached and the joint is not stopped, and the plaster and the tension are reduced over it several times, and it is not stopped and catches and cannot elevate that limb to the sides, know that the nerves of the limb, which are at the head of the muscle, are already insensible or extended or softened, and that the joint will never be fixed in place again
From the dislocation of that which is useful, take the foot and the ankle or the buttocks, the reduction is useful with impulse and extension more than by return
And let it be administered in the other way, and take care of that until it is healed.
And if by chance the recovery falls behind in the limb and the movement of it is delayed, the patient must use hot packs until that gravity is relieved and it returns to its natural state
Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Of care for dislocation of the knee joint.
Know that the knee joint is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and that which is dislocated throughout is more especially from the front to the back, and the dislocation of the knee is not hidden from you because it is caused by leaving it too long or by touching it according to whatever figure is dislocated, and when the knee joint is adjusted the dislocation is seen immediately, that is to say that the knee is concave and cannot bend the limb, nor touch with any of the muscles
And know that the knee and the ankle must be reduced as quickly as possible after the cautery is applied, for if you see it after the cautery is applied, the reduction will be difficult and will not be successful in any way; and more so when it is at the back, for it is worse in all other kinds of dislocation, and more painful, and many veins must be ligated in that area for death
And the restoration of it, when that which is possible is reduced, is that the hand be extended with two hands, the arms be expanded, and the hands of the physician be placed over the knee and under it, and the plaster must embrace the joint with the nails of the nails together, or with the heel of the palm within that it returns to its place.
May be if the dislocation is at the front, then return it by bending the hand toward the hand, until you perforate the cavity with the edge of the palm.
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, then administer violent extension and a strong thrust.
And two assistants extend the arms, and hold the patient's eyes so that it does not slip during the extension
And immediately rotate the arms around all parts, because it is enveloped around the hand or ligament
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, unite some oil so that it is moistened by those things that help to lubricate the joint and facilitate; and then press the joint with force until it returns.
Then cover the reduction with a bandage that has styptic and exudative properties of the album of hue, and suspend the limb with a tight bandage, and keep it suspended for several days
Then untie; and therefore if the joint is formed in the heel bone, then you should dissect the ligament of the heel and leave it free.</start_turn>
And if the joint is not healed, then repeat the packing and the ligament, and leave it for several days until it is extruded; and then untie it.</start_turn
May be if the accident has happened to it gravitated toward the reduction of the joint, and the condition is in movement, then administer humidity in vapor and friction in the air, and comprehend, until it is relieved; or rest over the joint relieved of greasy matter; and tie it up, and leave it for the day and the night.</start_turn And do so again, and put it in water; and when it is evening, the doctor should gently massage the joint with temperate friction, and then repeat over that relieved of nausea, so that it is harmonious of movement, one third, and two thirds, and the third.</start_turn Corruption has already spread throughout the bowels within the belly, until it is limited.
And if you wish, rest over that wound of the wet cow and scald it around the border and stretch over that; and make a few compressions, so that it is wet and reduces to its condition.</start_turn><end_turn>
Chapter XXVIII.</start_turn>
Of the treatment of dislocation of the limb, that is between the arm and the hand.</start_turn
The limb of the hand many times is dislocated, and the reduction of the dislocation of it is light, while the opposite is of the other joints, however cover that the speed in the reduction of it in the hour in which it is dislocated is not that the heel be apostematized or that something happens to it apostematized with the caut.
And the reduction of the dislocation of it is that you rest the wrist of the patient over a table and the minister extends the hand of that, and the doctor places his hand or palm over the imminent of the joint, and press that until it returns to the heel bone.</start_turn><end_turn>
However it must be considered if the palm is already twisted inside the hand, the doctor must place two hands of the patient over a table beyond the extension and the reduction; and if the dislocation is previous, you must place two hands of the patient, the doctor must place his hand intrinsically over the table so that his hand covers that imminent of the joint.</start_turn><end_turn
And so if it returns well, it is good; and if not, the doctor should tighten that with a bandage yielding the apostema and leave that; and do not repeat that, because if not, it will suffer or cannot be done over the reduction of it until they pass over it days.</start_turn><end_turn
However the joint remains according to its stiffness; and do not notice to the patient any cause, but that the hand is softened and cannot tighten any cause; the doctor should know that the nerves are cut or crushed, and that it is not due to it but that it is tightened with a pointed cautery as much as possible in the case of it and strong as much as it confers any cause.</start_turn><end_turn
Therefore when the limb is returned, the doctor should rest over it the bandage that has been recommended, and leave it and tighten it for five days; and then untie it and leave it and exercise the hand.</start_turn><end_turn

Some veins are dislocated from their entirety throughout the limb
And when any finger of those at the base or at the palm is dislocated, then it is said to be stiff and the dislocation must be driven back by placing the thumb and little finger against it, until it returns
And support the head of the finger, and suspend that part from which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days
And suspend it and extend it until it is equal in that limb on the next day
And when night comes, bind it according to that narration, and do not cease to loosen it in the day and exercise it, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is healed

From the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the spine.
When an accident happens to any vertebra of the spine or the pelvis dislocates completely, and some vertebrae are displaced from their places, in such a case there is no cure, for death is hidden under the sickness
And a sign of this is that the evacuation of the sickness is beyond voluntary control, and cannot be retained; and some veins are softened in some part of the limb or two veins of the limb or two bones of the limb, or one of these; or a vertebra is displaced from its place, which is softened and that the evacuation is made to four parts
Therefore that has already been softened behind and is called gelliosis.
May the treatment of it be that you consider if the gelliosis happened in infancy, for in that case neither the cure nor the healing of everything is possible
May in that case where it appears by chance or by percussion or by sensation that the ancients spoke of long methods of treatment, of which the most useful returns with profit; but I have already mentioned that I will abbreviate from that which is little useful for the great number, because of my proximity to the understanding of my exposition, which is what I have exposed and learned from various instruments, which I will show you and explain that one.
And of those there is no cure except that which happens in the two parts themselves with that which I recommend
And that the sickness be spread over its face over the edge of the gut and be extended without stretching them so that it does not touch the bones of the limb.
And put a vessel that has been torn to stop at the root of the gut surrounding the head of the limb, and another vessel in the belly of the limb in the other extremity of the limb.
And the minister has the vessel, and it is not fixed in the fossa; and another minister has the other in that way
And put a bandage over the head of the sickness and leave the nails to be seen; and extend the limb to the vessel which is at the head of the limb, and bind that to it; and put the other ligament over the buttocks of the limb under the navel, and over the bones of the limb; and adjust all the ligaments and bind them to the other vessel which is at the feet of the limb
And the minister grasps outside and extends the ligament to the part of the vessel, and they are not displaced from the two vessels and the ligaments of the limbs in which they are fixed, but nevertheless they are not fixed as we have said.
And the physician puts his palms on the vertebra with strength until it returns, or that he puts them on a table, and that he adjusts on the table the limbs of the patient until they return.
But if it does not return in this way, the physician takes a board of which the width or length is equal to three bones, and which is hollow in the belly, and he makes a hole in the wall of which we have said that it is proper for the sickness to be a place in which to put the limb. And the physician places the heel of the board on the vertebra, and the physician places the limbs of the patient on the other side, and he pulls until the vertebra is compressed and returns to its place.
If you wish, open the turn which is rotated among the hands; and that you remain on the ground keep the head of the patient at the back of the thighs, the length of one arm, and keep the head of them at the back of the knee with two fingers; and let the length be from one fist to the other fist, and already it is done in every fist where the turn comes back, and every one that remains on the ground shall not be moved.
And let one fist be round in which the turn is, and let it be rotated in the two joints of the two fists.
And at the end of them is a joint in which the fist is formed, the length of which is a palm as much as that which is rotated; and in the two other fists it is similar to this one
Then strengthen the ligaments that you have strained in the feet of the patient at the joint which is behind their head, and the ligaments which you have strained in the thighs of them at the turn which is behind their feet.
And then you must do every turn and stay there with a minister who will support the turn with his hand, and the physician will stabilize the spine as we have said
And when the spine has returned and the limb has been stabilized, the hour covers that you keep pressing with your hand towards the heel, and stop; and then place your hand over the bandage which is under the table which is as wide as three fingers or more, and as long as it covers the area of the swelling, and over the part of the spine that is below
And as for the ligament which we have mentioned, use the patient’s natural nourishment until they are healed.
And if there remains any swelling in the limb at the end of the healing, the hour covers that medicines that soften and soothe are administered with the application of the table for a long time, which we have recommended; and they are already administered in that limb lamina of lead
And many times the swelling immediately disappears behind the spines of both, and it is cured for that dislocation; and that is the bone which has already been mentioned because it does not seem to be necessary for this medicine, for its strength will do you more harm than good.
Chapter XXV
On the care of a dislocated ankle.
Know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the muscle must not be dislocated only, but that it must not happen to the other joints of the foot that are remote from the concavity and the prominence.
And the ankle joint is dislocated in four ways, which is dislocated at the front, or at the back, or at the top, or at the bottom
Mostly it is dislocated at the front, and little at the top or at the bottom
And a sign of the dislocation at the front is that, when you adjust the limb of the patient who is healthy with the limb that is sick, the ankle is longer and the heel is more prominent than the healthy one, and the limb cannot bend the knee over the ankle, and the limb is limp even after the cautery has been performed, so that the head of the bone has already reached here.
The sign of the dislocation at the back is that the accident happens in the opposite way to this one
The sign of the dislocation at the top is that the limb expands slightly as you command, but nevertheless does not bend where it hurts, and if you force it to go down it cannot go over that which is painful; and the urine is retained and the swelling is stagnant, and you must ambulate the limb on the ankle
The sign of the dislocation at the bottom is that it does not expand the ankle, nor does it allow bending of that which bends the swelling, and the limb is shorter than the other, and the swelling is softened, and the head of the bone is over that place.
More reduction of these species of dislocation is that you consider, the hour, if the dislocation is old and ancient, that it is already outdated with you having brought it to this state, the hour is not in this treatment at all; and when it is not necessary that in this case there is any benefit from this medicine
More in that one in which the dislocation is recent, and is one of the four species of dislocation, the hour will order you to return the joint and extend it to the front and to the back, and also to the right and left, for the force will return and will not need any other treatment
May, if he does not return in this manner, it is necessary that you prepare a strong minister and extend the limb from the part beyond where you have left it, or from the chest or from the limb that is bound to it; and another minister extend the hand of that which is nearest to the head and put his thumb on the nails of the limb. Then strengthen the limb with a tight bandage over the area and have another minister hold the extremity of the bandage.
And extend the limb or from the part towards the ankle to the part of the heel or from the part behind to the part of the buttocks.
And extend all of them together until the patient is elevated on the seat of the earth and remains hanging down
And this method of extension is customary for all four.
And thus if the dislocation returns where we have said, it is well; and if not, it is necessary to take all the measures that we have said of proper care
In the reduction of the limb itself, when it is dislocated, if the dislocation is at the heel, cover that the patient should be placed sitting on the buttocks; and then suspend the ligaments over the area of the joint at that place where between the head of the joint and the place that is left to hang down; and then extend the limb from the ankle to the highest part of the heel
And another minister should firmly grasp the ankles and immediately immobilize the great toe of the painful joint and extend the limb from the other side for violent extension, so that that which returns to the seat of the joint
This method is less severe treatment than the others for which this limb is reduced.<end_turn>
If it is excused about you and you do not obey the order according to this method of treatment, it is necessary that both feet of the patient be bound together with a strong ligament, loosely, over both ankles and over both toes.<end_turn>
And let the length of each part be equal to the quantity of four fingers, and let the painful limb be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
And let the patient be suspended over the head of the foot, and that he should be in the major; and let the length of the limb from the earth be equal to the quantity of two ankles
And let a strong youth command that he flex the head of the joint, and that another youth should suspend himself with the patient, and the other youth should push down the limb with force, so that the joint returns to the seat of the joint quickly.
And in the proper reduction, when it is dislocated at the outer part, cover that the patient should grab about the heel as we have recommended in the cold; and tighten the ligament over the painful limb properly and over the toes of the limb.
And two thighs should be placed, one at the foot of the limb, and the other at the head; and two thighs adjusted to the middle of the thigh that is left resting on which damp cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not moistened because the thigh is between the patient's thighs, because of that the extension of the limb from the ankle should not be too violent.<end_turn>
And let each minister extend his part, and the doctor with his hand grasp the reduction according to the art.<end_turn
And when the dislocation is at the ankle, it is necessary that the limb be slightly extended; and this is according to the aforementioned method for the thigh; and the doctor should place the palm of his right hand over the painful limb, and let him take hold of that with his left hand, and with that hold the limb extended from the ankle to the heel.
And if the dislocation is at the back, it is not necessary that the limb be extended from the ankle, but that it be elevated above the earth; and it is necessary that it be held firmly in place, just as if the ankle joint was dislocated outwards, as we have said of the position of the limb over two palms; and it is on its face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, not too tightly.<end_turn>
And it is necessary that a bandage be administered around the area around the joint which is painful.<end_turn
Therefore when the reduction is completed as we have said – and the sign of the reduction of the limb is not hidden from you, that you extend two limbs of the patient, and when you have once again pulled those bandages and the patient pulls his seat limb and expands that excuse, you will know that the limb as we have said is returned – and then you adjust two cushions and place them under and extend with a bandage so that the ankle is not bruised in any of the parts; and keep the patient still for three days or for four.
And remove the ligament and the paste, and compare one limb with the other.
When, however, these inflammations remain in the limb, it is known that the dislocation has already ceased, and now you must let the patient rest.</end_of_turn>
And if any cause of discomfort remains, then you return it and cover that [affected area], and remove that according to your first structure, and leave that for three days.</end_of_turn
And remove that [affected area], and make that walk slowly on crutches for several days, until comfort is restored.</end_of_turn>
(The text continues with further medical instructions)</end_of_turn>
Treatment for dislocation of the thumb.</end_of_turn>
The thumb is dislocated in three ways, that is, dislocation at the base, at the middle, and at the distal joint; and not at the proximal joint.</end_of_turn
And the sign of dislocation is that the patient applies pressure to the limb; know that the thumb is dislocated.</end_of_turn
And the restoration of all these positions is to make the patient flex the limb, extend the limb as much as possible; attach two fingers to the side of the limb, and suspend the foot of the limb between the thighs; and make sure to reattach the thumb to its place between the two metacarpal bones with force, and another assistant should extend the limb until the thumb returns to its place.</end_of_turn
And the sign of recovery is that the limb rests easily without pain.</end_of_turn
And cover that with a dressing and make the limb adhere to the limb, and bind the two together with a bandage for three days or four, and then remove the bandage.</end_of_turn
Do not let the patient walk for several days, until they are healed and comfortable.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if the reduction was performed by you, know that you must administer a strong extension of the ligaments that were previously treated for the swelling.</end_of_turn
End of treatment for dislocation of the thumb.</end_of_turn>
Treatment for dislocation of the ankle.</end_
The ankle may be slightly sprained due to minor dislocation, or it may be completely dislocated, and the dislocation can be located at the proximal or distal joint.</end_of_turn
The sign of dislocation is that sometimes the ankle swells as a result of the dislocation.</end_of_turn
The treatment for reduction is gentle recovery, that is, with ease and without pain, and is extended with the greatest ease when possible, and is reduced when it returns.</end_of_turn
When the dislocation is complete, make the patient flex the limb and keep that finger held in place by a strong and valiant assistant at the back of the limb in place of the dislocation.</end_of_turn
And put your right hand over the great toe and your left hand over the little toe of the foot in the place of the ankle.</end_of_turn
And pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and with the left hand for two inches, and extend with the left; and support the foot of the limb with the right hand beside the bandage.</end_of_turn
And do this two inches as many times as necessary.</end_of_turn
And support the foot of the limb to the bandage for the third inch, and you are at the ankle.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if it returns in one inch or two according to this manner, and if the foot sometimes swells, it is good; otherwise, repeat the operation until it returns.</end_of_turn
If the reduction is prohibited in this way, make the patient sit on the toes on the ground, and apply a cushion under the foot, and that you keep between the thighs of the patient, and you have already immobilized the limb with a bandage to prevent it from being injured.</end_of_turn
And the assistants should hold the patient's thighs, and another assistant should extend the limb with their hands or with the ligaments that lie on the ankle; and extend whichever assistant wants against the extension of the limb, and the cushion should remain between the patient's thighs to prevent the limb from being pulled downwards from its extension.</end_of_turn
And the doctor grasps the dislocation at the hip joint, while another assistant holds the sound limb away from the affected area, so that the dislocation can return easily.
Therefore, when the dislocation has returned and its soundness has been declared, stop the plastering and gently stretch the limb again, and bind the foot to the limb with a bandage.</end_of_turn>
And beware or take care of the nerves that are behind the ankle, so that the ligament on that side is not tight and the other side is not too loose.</end_of_turn>
Then leave it for two days or three; and if the ligament is softened, remove it.</end_of_turn>
And on the fourth day or the fifth, remove the dressing and prohibit the patient from eating for forty days.</end_of_turn> May it be necessary to go down again that space, it is not wrong to ensure that the dislocation is not dissolved and corrupted, and that it receives no treatment.</end_of_turn>
And if during the process of treatment the patient develops a fistula, cover that in the cede of our narration in another place of care and dressing, until it has healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XXXIII.</end_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocations of the bones of the foot.</end_of_turn
Therefore, that which has been dislocated must be grasped with little traction; and what is not difficult, abstain from it.</end_of_turn
If the dislocation is in the ankle bone of the two feet, then cover the patient’s foot with the earth or a table, and remain in that way as if you were going.</end_of_turn
Then rest your feet, and keep the foot above the joints still over what you imagine from the joints, and keep your heel on the same level as before, until it returns, and that you see that it has healed and does not reappear in the immediate area.</end_of_turn
And leave the patient’s foot under a board that covers all the foot, which has two caps, and keep that tight with a strap for three days; and then remove that and have the patient walk for a month, until it is healed and the recovery is ensured.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXXV.</end_of_turn
Of the kinds of dislocations that are caused by swelling or fracture or any other lesion.</end>
When any cause of these has occurred, and you have perforated in the treatment of that and in the restoration of it, many times death follows.</end_of_turn
Therefore, for this we do not presume that in the treatment of that we should trust, but he who is learned in the art, of long experience, merciful and humble, prudent, not arrogant or presumptuous; and that he use in the beginning of medicines that do not cause fistula so much alone, and that you read the patient to the divine judgment, rather than to that to which you hope for healing, from the disease relief, and in which you appear any hope.</end_of_turn And so do your best to make the reduction in the beginning of the cause, despite the fistula.</end_of_turn
And so if the limb returns as we want, then administer a regimen that yields fistula and heals the swelling in what way it seems convenient to you.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation is in a fractured bone and the fragments are separated, then you perforate the membrane of their cavity, and do what has been said in the simple diseases of what precedes these.</end_of_turn
And keep and avoid according to your prudence that which is before you of the treatment of fear as I have foretold; for what is better for you must be attributed to the Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more profitable for the true things that are in your heart.</end_of_turn Thus ends the treatise of Albucasim perfectly blessed by God.</end_of_turn> Amen.</end_of_turn>
