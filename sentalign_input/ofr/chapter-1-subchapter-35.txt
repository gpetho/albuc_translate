of the fleshy growth that is called "thelul" (keloid)
When you cut the keloid, heat a cautery that resembles a razor, and then place it, while still burning, on the cut keloid;
and keep your hand there until the cautery reaches the base of the vein from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is a lot of keloid, cauterize each one as we have said;
afterwards treat them with beneficial ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the keloid, it will have a greater effect.
