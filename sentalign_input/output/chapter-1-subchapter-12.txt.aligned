of the wateriness of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes by the signs I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that will cleanse the head, and keep him away from all moistures, and make him sweat or bathe several times while fasting.	On cautery in cataract of the eye. When by those signs I have mentioned in the relevant section there is brought to your notice the beginning of a cataract of the eye, start with draughts for the patient such as shall cleanse his head; and guard him from all humidities. Make him also sweat for some days, fasting, in the bath.	0.7573009
Afterward command him to shave his head, and make a cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is in both eyes together, or in one if the descent is in one; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the core, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple; and beware of bleeding, and if you see too much blood flowing, then stop it with whatever power you have.	Then tell him to have his head shaved; and burn him with one cauterization in the middle of the head; then cauterize him with two burns on the temples if the cataract is beginning in both eyes; or on the one side only if it is in one eye. And with the cautery cut all the subcutaneous veins and arteries; and let the cauterizations be long, across the breadth of the temples. Beware of haemorrhage; if you see any, stanch it straight away with any means you can.	0.88041645

We shall deal later on with the method of extraction and cutting out of arteries, and provision against haemorrhage. Two strong cauterizations are sometimes made on the back of the neck below the two bones.	0.7382294
