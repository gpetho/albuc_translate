Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the Treatment of Knee Dislocation.
The knee dislocates in three ways: it dislocates inwards, outwards, and downwards—I mean backwards—and it does not dislocate forwards at all. The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to press his leg against his thigh.
If it does not stick to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. The treatment for all its dislocations is to have the patient sit down with his legs extended, if he is able to do so, and have an assistant sit behind him to hold his waist and bend it back a little, then you sit on his thighs.
Place your back against his face and put his leg between your legs, then grasp his knee with your palms, interlocking your fingers over his knee. Then squeeze the sides of his knee firmly with your palms, while another assistant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
The sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh smoothly and without force. Then bandage it and press the leg against the thigh, then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.  He should only undertake a little walking for several days until it strengthens.
If its return is difficult for you using what we have described, then use strong traction with the bandages that we described previously in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
