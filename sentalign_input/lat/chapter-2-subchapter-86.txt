On the treatment of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Chapter 88.
Know that every wound or swelling, when it becomes chronic and aged, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal, continually discharges pus, and is not closed: then it is universally called a fistula, wherever it is on the body, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula is indeed, in truth, a knotted, filtered, hard, white formation: without pain, having the hollowness of a bird's feather: and for that reason, some call it Risati, which means feather.
And at certain times it is moist, discharging pus.
And sometimes the moisture is drained at certain times.
And sometimes this moisture is abundant, sometimes scant; it is thick, or it is thin.
And I have already explained in the section on wounds that every ulcer that does not heal, nor grows flesh within, is due to one of nine causes.
One of these causes is either the body's lack of blood, or its malignancy; or because there is hard flesh between it and above its edges, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there is much filth and foulness; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the substance discharged into it is of poor quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its healing; or because a type of pestilence has fallen upon the area; or due to a regional property, as occurs in Zaragoza, where the digestion of ailments is difficult, and the healing of swellings is delayed by nature; or because there is a bone or several bones in it.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the section; here, I shall make you aware of the treatment of the fistula and Zuken, which is performed by surgical operation.
Know, therefore, that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body.
For among them are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or tendons; or to the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs; or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the compound joints, like those of the hand and foot; and among them are those that approach the proximity of a principal organ, and similar.
Therefore, those among these fistulas in this manner are illnesses difficult to heal, and do not accept treatment; engaging with them is laborious and uncertain.
But if there is a fistula whose depth does not reach these places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its healing, and wish to investigate it, then take a probe of copper or iron, if the fistula extends straight, and examine it with that.
If, however, there is twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
For lead, with its softness, adapts and bends around the twists.
If the fistula has multiple openings, it is not possible to investigate it with a probe.
Therefore, inject from one of its openings into the others.
For the moisture with which you inject it travels toward the other openings and flows from them.
Then carefully investigate in any way possible, so that you may recognize whether there is a bone, or a nerve, and whether the fistula’s cavity is deep or shallow; or if it is a single fistula with multiple openings. Consider all of this with the utmost diligence, by questioning the patient, by detecting pain when pressing your hand upon the location, and through other signs and causes related to the swelling.
When you have confirmed all of this precisely, then proceed confidently with the treatment: if the fistula is close and visible, or in a safe location distant from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the areas I have described, then cut the fistula as I have previously explained, and remove from it any impurities or corrupted flesh, which grows at its opening from flesh or callus, and similar matter; and treat it until it heals.
If, however, the fistula is of great depth and is straight, then you must cut it as deeply as possible.
Then cleanse it thoroughly of all corrupted flesh.
Next, apply wicks wrapped in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have explored with iron; repeat this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it heals.
If it does not heal through that method, then cauterize it as we have described.
If the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you are certain of this, then locate it and cut it as I have explained, unless something such as a vein, nerve, or principal organ prevents you, as we have said.
If, then, you uncover a bone, and there is some corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it until all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with what generates flesh until it heals.
If it does not heal and continues to discharge pus as before, then know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again and perform a careful scraping and cleansing with your utmost diligence.
Then restore it.
If it heals, that is good; but if not, then know that the corruption is in a deep part of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore, you have no recourse but to leave it to nature.
But if the affected bone is small and you are able, extract it with delicate forceps suited to it.
If there are multiple bones, then carefully extract all of them, leaving none behind, using all your strength.
If any moisture obstructs you, and there is no risk or error in cutting it, then incise the moisture and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
If you are not prepared to remove the bones immediately, then place on the wound something that will cause it to decay, and leave it until the flesh and moisture around those bones putrefy.
And keep the wound from closing.
And tighten the incision that you made in your operation.
Indeed, if you fear, place over it a cloth soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those moistures putrefy and the bones separate from them, their removal and extraction is eased.
If it is a single large bone, such as the shin bone, or hip bone, or similar, and a large part of it is affected, then scrape it thoroughly until all blackness and corruption are removed.
Then restore the wound.
But if the affected part is large, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it completely up to the place where the corruption has reached; then treat it until it heals.
And I will tell you about a case of zuken that affected a man’s leg, so that you may use it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, about thirty years old, who experienced pain in his leg due to a cause originating within his body, that is, from internal sources, until the matter reached his leg, and a large swelling formed: and there was no external cause.
Thus, a long time passed with the errors of the physicians, until the swelling was opened, and much matter collected in it.
And his treatment was delayed until his leg developed fistulas, and many openings formed in it, all of which discharged pus and bodily moisture.
Thus, many physicians treated him for about two years, but there was no skilled practitioner, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the matter flowing abundantly from those openings; the man’s whole body had already wasted away, and his complexion was yellowish.
So I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings, and found them connecting with each other from all parts of the leg.
So I hastened and cut over one of those openings until I exposed part of the bone, and found it corrupted; it was already eaten away, blackened, rotten, and perforated, extending even into the marrow.
Therefore, I sawed off what I had uncovered, the corrupted part of the bone.
And I determined that there was no other corruption in the bone except that which I had cut and sawed off.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restorative treatment to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
But it did not heal.
Then I probed, and exposed the bone a second time beyond the first exposure, and found further corruption in the bone; so I sawed off that portion of corruption as well.
Then I attempted to restore it.
But it was not restored.
So I exposed it again, and continued cutting the bone piece by piece, and attempted to restore it; but it was not restored until I had cut off about one palm’s length of bone and removed it with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it healed quickly and was cured; this repetition in his operation and cutting was necessary only because of the patient’s weakness, his limited tolerance, and my fear for his life, for he frequently suffered fainting spells from excessive drainage.
Thus, he was completely healed; hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, his body was restored to good condition, his strength returned, and he resumed his regular activities; walking posed no difficulty for him at all.
But if a prominent bone in a part of the body is already fractured, then you must saw it as follows: take a band, and tie it at the end of the prominent bone, instruct someone to pull it upward, and place another band made of wool, thicker than the first band.
Then tie it over the flesh beneath the bone, and extend its end to draw the flesh downward; and you expose the flesh over the area you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place a piece of wood or a board properly beneath the lower part of the bone, for when you do this, it prevents the saw from cutting the decayed flesh.
The sawing must be slightly above the corrupted area, so that no corruption remains within the hollow of the bone; and nothing should be visible to indicate the need for further sawing.
But if the bone is corrupted and is not protruding, rather it continues from one part to another, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part of it, then expose all the flesh from all sides.
Then place a piece of wood beneath it.
Afterward, saw it from the first part where the corruption is, until the sawing continues to the other side; and let the sawing be slightly beyond the length of the corruption, as we have said.
But if the corruption is in a joint, cut through that corrupted joint and saw the bone where it connects to the other side.
If the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then the only solution is to abrade it.
If the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, then the matter is exceedingly difficult.
However, you must examine how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and clean it by any method possible to you, and with whatever skill is appropriate for you, provided that no vein or nerve obstructs you.
And know that the cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, depending on the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their fineness, their size, their smallness, their hardness, and their sparseness.
Therefore, you must prepare a suitable instrument for each type of operation.
And know that these operations reveal to you the kind of instrument you need, when you engage in prolonged study.
And knowledge of the methods of this art, through experience with various ailments, will enable you to find on your own the appropriate instrument for every affliction.
And I am setting forth for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which serve as examples for cutting, and the test by which you may apply them to other cases.
Form of the saw.
Form of another saw.
Form of yet another saw.
Form of yet another saw.
This form of the saw is depicted, let it be made properly.
Let its upper arc be made, with sharpness from iron; its handle from boxwood, and let it be shaped like a pyramid, made properly.
Form of a joint scraper.
Let the head of this scraper be shaped like the head of a star-shaped nail, and its points like the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not suitable except for rubbing the heads of joints when they are corrupted, or when the bone is large and broad.
Form of a larger scraper.
Form of a medium scraper.
Form of a broad scraper.
Form of a scraper with a hollow.
Form of another fine scraper.
Form of another scraper with a curved end.
Form of a small, fine probe scraper.
Form of the scraper with which bones are incised.
Form of a large scraper as well.
This is similar to a spoke, and the end is like a saw; it is displayed in many locations for bone scraping.
Form of the scraper suited for scraping perforated bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp points.
It is made from Indian steel.
And similarly, all the scrapers, cutters, and saws we have mentioned should be made accordingly.
