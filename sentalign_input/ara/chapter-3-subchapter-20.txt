Chapter Twenty.
On the treatment of stiffness that occurs after some fractures.
This stiffness often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially near the joints, which deforms the limb and may prevent it from functioning normally.
Examine it, and if the stiffness is soft, use astringent medications such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, gentian, acacia, and the like, by taking some or all of these and kneading them with an astringent syrup, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the stiffness in a compress and tie it tightly. Leave the bandage undisturbed for many days, then remove it and reapply another until the stiffness is gone, God willing, or apply a tightly fitted lead plate.
Lead has a special property that removes any outgrowth on the limbs. If the stiffness has hardened and intensified, and the necessity to remove it is urgent, incise it from above and cut or scrape the protruding excess with a scraper until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
