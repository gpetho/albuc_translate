of abscesses of the nerves
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and in the vein, abscesses also occur in the nerves when they are injured, or by excessive work, and similar things.
And this occurs most often in the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in many cases without pain; and when it is pressed firmly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin; and it moves easily in all directions, and goes neither forward nor backward, neither below nor above, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with an iron instrument: perhaps contraction would occur; and the one that is on the head or forehead, incise the skin with a spatula.
If the abscess is small, hold it with forceps and cut it at its root; and if it is large, suspend it with a hook and peel it, then remove it and close the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
