On the incision of abscesses occurring in the abdomen.
Chapter 51.
In the abdomen and elsewhere on their bodies, certain men frequently develop thelils, which are called Fungalia, due to their resemblance to mushrooms.
Their roots are thin, their heads are thick, and their edges are turned inward.
Some are small, and some become quite large.
Indeed, I have seen a man with two thelils in his abdomen, which resembled mushrooms more than anything else: there was no difference between them, they were white, with thin roots, and their edges turned inward, were split, and constantly oozed moisture.
I incised them, and found one to weigh about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces. In the procedure for incising them, you must consider whether the patient is of moist constitution and the thelil is white, moist, with a thin root: in that case, incise it with a broad scalpel, and have the cautery ready in the fire.
For frequently much blood is expelled upon incision; therefore, act quickly if the bleeding overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
If the patient appears fearful and anxious about incision with a blade, then take a thread of well-made lead and tie it around the athelul as we described, and leave it for two days.
Then increase the tightness of the lead.
Continue tightening the lead each time it presses into the thelil, until it is severed and falls off on its own without effort.
If, however, the thelil has a thick root, then there is indeed some fear and dread in its incision, especially in the abdomen.
However, it is possible to incise half of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent its return.
Then care for it until the wound heals.
And beware of attempting to incise any thelil that is dark-colored, insensate, and foul-looking, for it is a cancerous abscess, and I shall address Cancer further after this.
