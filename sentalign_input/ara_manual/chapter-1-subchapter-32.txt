Chapter Thirty-Two
On Cauterizing the Feet and Legs
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the dorsum of the foot in the depression between the little toe and the ring finger.
Keep your hand steady with the cautery iron and do not twist it. Then lift your hand and do not bring it back at all, for it will drain the yellow water. The cautery iron should be of this shape:
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg. The cauterization should be done with the knife-edge of the cautery iron and should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it towards the middle of the leg. And on each thigh, two cauterizations.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so that the water drains from it, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
