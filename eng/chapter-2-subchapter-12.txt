 CHAPTER TWELVE.
On the removal with the needle of irritating lashes from the eye.
 If it be one or two hairs the operation will be to take a fine needle, thread it with a fine smooth silk, bring the ends together, and knot them with a tiny knot; the thread should be about a span in length.
Then in the loop insert another fine thread, shorter than the first, and join the ends with a knot if you wish.
Then let the patient put his head in your lap in full sunlight, so that the operation may be clearly seen, because it is very fine work.
Then introduce the needle with the loop to the root of the superfluous hair and run it quickly through the eyelid till you make it come out above the natural hair.
Then draw the thread to the top of the loop and introduce that hair into the loop if it be one, two, or three, but not more.
Then draw away your hand with it until the hair emerges with the loop on the eyelid among the natural hair.
If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, you draw the loop down by means of the thread which you have previously passed through it, until the loop comes out at the upper perforation.
Then put the hair back in and draw them both up; keep on until the hair rises up in the upper perforation and you can see it.
Then extract loop and thread and take them both out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days till the hair be fixed in its place and there is regeneration of flesh over it.
If the hair be short, put with it a long natural hair so that it may be raised together with that; or let the hair grow till it reach a greater length, then raise it.
