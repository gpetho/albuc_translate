Chapter 53:
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already said, in the division, about the types of cancer and the manner of treating it with medicines, and that treatment with iron should be avoided so it does not become ulcerated; and we have discussed cancer engendered in the flesh and the precautions for its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, as with cancer in the breasts or the thigh and their similar members, to extract all of it, especially when it is just starting small.
But when it is old and large, do not attempt to treat it, for I could not cure any of it nor have I seen another who could.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you precede and let the patient purge the black bile sometimes, and then bleed him, if a manifest repletion is found.
Then prepare the patient with preparation in which he is located for the operation, and then apply hooks where necessary; and then hollow out all around with a good cutting, ensuring no root cause remains.
And let the blood flow, and do not cut it lightly, and press the places, and wipe away the thick blood with your hand or with an instrument as possible.
But if the thick blood contradicts you by cutting a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the blood flow ceases, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
