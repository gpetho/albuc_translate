of the kneecap
Know that in the kneecap, fractures rarely occur, but it bends often.
And if it breaks, it is only a fissure, or a hole, and it happens with a wound, and without a wound, and this one feels well.
And the restoration is that one sets even that which is round with one's fingers, as much as it can be assembled by feel;
then apply the plaster, and put a round splint, if you need one, and tighten it as needed, then consider all the dispositions that we have discussed in other fractures, such as hot abscesses and other similar things;
so apply to each injury what is appropriate, until it is healed.
