stinking pustules / of stinking pustules
Sometimes bumps, or stinking pustules, appear on the outer body, which come from large corrupted materials/humors.
So, first, when they appear, a cautery must be made on each head of the pustule:
A subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose tip is set on fire, or of long birthwort root, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this way, and they cannot grow further from then on, but the superfluity from which they come is broken, and they are healed;
But this must be done after bloodletting.
