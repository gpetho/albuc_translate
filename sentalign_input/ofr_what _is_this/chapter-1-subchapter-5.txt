of ear pain from cold
When pain from cold occurs in the ear, and one has applied dissolving medicines and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery which is called "point," of which here is the form:
Afterward, prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and stay a little above the base of the ear after you have marked the spot with ink; and make ten pricks around each ear; then treat the area until it is healed.
