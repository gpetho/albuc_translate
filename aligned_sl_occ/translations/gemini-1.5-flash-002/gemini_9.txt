O, son, since I have completed for you this book, which is the culmination of the science of medicine, and through its completion, its end, and through its expositions and declarations, it seems to me that I should satisfy you with this treatise, which is a part of hand-operation, that is, surgery.
Because hand-operation is almost entirely lost in our region and in our time, so that its science is greatly diminished, and its practice is obstructed; and nothing remains of it but some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which are mostly altered and have fallen into errors and uncertainties, so that their intentions are obscure and their power and art are weakened.
And it seems to me that I should revive it with the ordering of this treatise, according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and that it should come with the forms of the cautery instruments and the other instruments of the work, as it should be, by addition of the description, and by its preparation, which is a necessary cause.
But the reason why a good artisan with his hands is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and that its practitioner must first be exercised in the science of anatomy, which Galen mastered, so that he knows the joints of the limbs and their forms, and their connection and separation; and he should have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their origin; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that with one name much is said, but little in the work, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not learned in what we have said about anatomy, is not exempt from falling into error, by which men will be killed, as I have seen many of them, for some are trained in this science and practice it without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced physician incise a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he incised some arteries of the neck, so that a great quantity of blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who undertook to remove a stone from a man who was in his old age, and the stone was large, and he came to him and extracted that stone with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and it happened to a black eunuch who had a fractured thigh; and the physician, through his ignorance, extracted the fracture, over the wound, with cushions and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound to breathe (i.e., did not allow for proper ventilation or drainage).
Then he unbound it according to his desires, and then he bound it again, and then he left it for several days and ordered that we not unbind the bandage; and it remained thus until the thigh and foot were abscessed, and it came to ruin (i.e., resulted in a bad outcome).
And I was called to him, and I prepared to unbind the bandage, and tranquility was achieved and thus a lessening of his pains.
But however, corruption was already confirmed in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated for several days, until the malignancy of it was magnified with its lord (i.e., the disease worsened significantly).
The reason is that because the burning cancer is pure melancholic humor, then it is not fitting that it be approached with iron at all, but rather it should be in a limb which suffers such that it should be completely avoided (or left alone).
And for this reason, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation with the hand be divided into two parts: that is, in an operation which is associated with health, and in a work with which there is danger in the greatest dispositions (i.e.,  in the most serious cases).
And I have already explained this in every part of this book, in which operations come which are full of error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you that you guard against this and leave that (i.e., avoid dangerous operations), so that fools do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your instruments with diligence and with the protection of God, and treat your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best method, by the grace of God, leading to health and praiseworthy success, and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult healing, and avoid those things that make you fear, so that hesitation in your faith and in your name may not escape you: for it is more beneficial to your glory, and higher in the world and behind your sanctities (i.e.,  it enhances your reputation and adds to your holiness).
Galen already said in some of his admonitions: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called a bad physician.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter deals with the head down to the feet,  the forms of instruments, and the tools of cautery, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of incision and perforation, and of cupping glasses, and of wounds, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, the whole chapter organized by the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, of reduction and dislocation, and of the treatment of sprains and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and of the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary that I say the quality of the benefits of that cautery and its drawbacks, and in what constitution cautery is prohibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and its drawbacks is a long and prolix discourse, and subtle in science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they have disagreed about it, and a little of their discourses suffices for me, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all complexions universally, whether with matter or without matter, except two complexions, which are hot complexions without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial to it, and others say the contrary, that cautery is not suitable for a disease that is due to heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a hot and dry disease should be healed with that which is hot and dry.
And I oppose those who say the contrary, that benefit is done by cautery in every hot and dry disease that comes to the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say, concerning this discourse, that experience has revealed this to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that one should undertake this who is not already experienced and exercised in the chapter on cautery by previous practice, and has known the diversity of the complexions of men and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and the causes of them, and their accidents, and the duration of them.
But in other complexions, there is no fear for you, and especially in cold and moist diseases, for all physicians are agreed on these, and are not in disagreement about the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire and its goodness, over cautery with burning medicine, is because fire is simple, its action does not reach but to the member which is cauterized, and does not harm another member contiguous to it, but with little harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches to those members which are distant from it, and quickly brings to the afflicted member a disease of difficult healing and quickly kills.
But fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except to purge.  And it is known to us by experiment and by long service of study in the art concerning the truth of the causes; and therefore I am excused from the length of discourse. And if it were not that it is not fitting to explain in my book this secret entrusted to you concerning fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies and its expulsion by which it expels diseases, with a philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would be tedious to your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree about the time in which it is convenient to perform cautery, and they posit springtime as the best time.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, because the harm from accidental timing is submerged in the benefit of what is obtained with the cautery, and especially if the cautery is for pains, or necessary, strong and urgent pains, which do not allow delay, because it is feared that evils may arise which are greater than the slight harm caused by the timing.
And this does not occur to your minds, or, sons, this is only considered by the common people and foolish physicians, namely that for that illness which is healed by cautery, there is no remission at all times, and they posit this consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they think for this reason, because cautery is nothing other than a medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
However, cautery is superfluous over medicine because of the speed of its efficacy and virtue of its operation and the greatness of its power.
And it is possible that his illness returns at some time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his illness, and his constitution, and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him, and what has come to him in his acquisition of foods and similar causes; unless the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a member with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth for pain and similar things, it is possible that that pain will not return to him, but this happens in small things.
And moreover, the common saying is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and this is a true saying, not in the sense that they understand it, for they believe that it is not a cure that benefits with medicine or with anything else besides cautery.
And the reason is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is only when we administer methods of cure in certain illnesses, and those medicines do not work, and then at the end of the process, one administers cautery, and it is beneficial in that case. And therefore, from this it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and the many foolish physicians.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the evenness of gold and the nobility of its substance.
And they said that the location of cautery does not matter, although that is not entirely true, for I have already tested this and have found that it only works this way in some bodies and not others, and cautery with gold is good and better than with iron as they said; however, when you perform cautery with fire with gold, it is not clear to you, because it is melted according to the quantity you desire due to the softness of gold, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you apply too much ignition, the gold melts from the fire, and some plates fall into the fire so that the artisan is troubled by that.
And therefore, cautery with iron is done more easily and more appropriately to the correctness of the operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head to the feet, so that I might provide the enquirer with what he seeks from it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization counteracts the humidity and coldness on the brain, the accident of which has two causes: that is, a cause of cold and a multitude of rheumatic flux, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and much sleep, and toothache and throat ache, and universally of every illness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, sopor and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The form of this cauterization is this: first, order the patient to be evacuated with laxative medicine, cleansing the head, for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, his age, and his constitution.
And then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then make him sit between your hands on a low bench and make him place his hands on his feet.
And then place the root of your palm near the pulse on the root of the nose between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that spot, mark that spot with ink, and then ignite the olive-shaped cautery, of which this is the form:
And then place it on the spot marked with ink, in such a way that it descends, with which your hand is gradually tightened, and you turn it.
And then lift your hand slightly and observe the area, and if you see some quantity of the head of the bone uncovered, like the amount of a grain of barley, then lift your hand, and if not, return your hand with that iron, with another of those, if it is cooled, until that which I have told you is seen of the bone.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the area and leave it for three days.
And then place on it cotton soaked in wine, and leave it there until the burn scar is destroyed. And then treat the area with tetrafarmicon ointment until it is healed.
And it has been said that when the wound remains open, it is better to leave the arm thus, because it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the bone marrow should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the bone's substance is hardened.
And then scrape away what is burnt from the bone, and then let it be cured.
And others say that with the cautery, penetrate to the rear, until it firmly enters the bone, pressing until the bone breaks, and this is the form of a small alphecat: And they believe that vapors from the head expire from that place.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then it should be cured until it is consolidated.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery at all, except in some men, as a way of frightening them; and leave that, it seems to me, better is health when it is; because the head is weakened by the solution of its continuity, as we have testified in the other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a cold nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better, in my opinion; and with that I use and with that I work towards health.
Chapter two.
Concerning the cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs in the entire head, and this is prolonged in the patient, and he uses leeches and cupping and purgatives and plasters and potions and poultices and ointments and similar things, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery which we mention and none of those things benefit him, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and if it is not cold and he finds much great cold, then cauterize him with another cautery a little below that one. And then cauterize that above the horn of his head with a cautery until the scab is separated. Incise the scab and let the bone be uncovered to the extent that we have recounted, and cauterize that with a cautery in the rear part of the head in the place which is called the vas — and this is the place where a cupping glass is placed. And lighten your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient through this finds much great pain different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
And I would say this cautery in its place, for it is necessary that the cautery with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle place of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Chapter three.
On the cauterization of recent migraine.
When a sudden pain occurs in the part of the head, or a widespread pain within the eye, let the head be evacuated with purifying medicines, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have described in the chapters on diseases; and if all this does not help, then cauterization in this case is done in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and peel it and cut off the ends from both sides. Then incise the location of the pain in the temple with a lancet until a place is made under the skin, until it is hidden.
Then bind it tightly with a compress to cause constriction, and leave it for the space of three hours; and then unbind it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then apply a cotton ball soaked in vinegar until the area becomes sore.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner:  heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
and it is called a nail or peg, because its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small prominence.
And then place it on the location of the pain, and hold your hand — so that the cautery, which is below, is not burned — and turn the iron little by little with speed.
And if the amount that is burned by the heat of the cautery is about half of it, then lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned, so that no blood flow occurs.
Then soak cotton in salt water and place that on the area, and leave it for three days; then apply cotton soaked in wine, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of the knife as with a cautery, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine, specifically not the old kind.
Chapter four.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic migraine.
When you treat a migraine with what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and sometimes because of the illness, what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire is insufficient, then you should heat the knife cautery until it is white hot,  then mark the location of the pain with a line whose length is half a finger or thereabouts; and place your hand for a moment and hold it while you incise the area and penetrate to the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful of the continuation of the jaw, which is moved during mastication, and that the muscle not be injured and the nerve that serves it, and that spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the protection and caution against blood flow from the artery that is incised, because in its incision there is danger, and especially for one who ignores what he does and is not studious and experienced; and leaves the operation at the beginning.
And I will come to the recollection of the regime of accidental blood flow from the incision, according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if you see that this illness is not relieved by this cauterization and the patient's body is tolerable, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on the constriction of an artery with a cautery having two blades, and this cauterization is better and more suitable.
Chapter 5.
Of the cauterization of earaches.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxative remedies and with the other treatment which I have described in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, and this is what is called a puncture, of which this is the form:
And then puncture, then apply the cautery, and let it be moved around the entire ear as a wheel is turned, or in the circumference of each part if the pain is in a specific part. Extend the cautery from the root of the ear little by little, after you have marked the place with a probe.
And if the cautery requires ten punctures in the whole ear, or whichever one it is, then treat the places until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
On the cauterization of a cough.
A cough which is cured with cauterization is only of those types which come from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Avoid cauterization of the type that comes from dryness or from a spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of cough with leeches and purgatives and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries:  the first at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side from the affected part, because softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery at the very tip of the upper ear, a little above the temple, and at the temple another, the length of which should be according to the length of the little finger, and you hold your hand with the cautery until the amount burned is half the thickness of a fingernail.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife, the form of which is shown before. (This implies an accompanying illustration). However, it is more subtle to do it a little like this; and it is necessary to cut away some of the superfluous thickness.
And then treat the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment is ineffective and the patient has no fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries:  on each of the corners of their head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the nape of the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as described above.
And it is already cauterized above the mouth of the stomach; and it is further behind; and then let it be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the cauterization of forgetfulness (amnesia) done by flame.
So that large potions and purifying pills for the brain are given to the patient at the beginning.
And then shave the entire head of the patient and place on his nape of the neck a plaster of the kind described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply that several times, for this is a manner of cauterization. And do this according to the same order which I have already said.
And therefore if he is healed by those means, it is good; and if not, then make for him three cauterizations in the back part of his head, descending from the highest part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. And place between each cauterization the width of a finger, and then treat the cauterization with what has been previously described.
But if you see increased swelling and the patient tolerates it, then make a cauterization in the middle of the area; and if you see even greater swelling, then cauterize it above the two horns (presumably referring to bony protrusions or similar).
Then treat that until it is healed; and let the cauterization be olive-shaped, according to the form previously given.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
So that you proceed in the purification of the head with leeches and with what we have said; and then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery above all the horns of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body to find that and the patients are suffering and the illness is severe, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery until it is burned from the tailbone of it, and raise your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be an olive cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is due to phlegm.
And therefore it is necessary that you purify his brain at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatment which we have described in the section when the patient is strong and is tolerant of the expulsion of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and masticatories that purify the brain, before that, for many days, with improvement of the diet.
Then shave the head of the patient, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery on the occiput, and cauterize over each temple. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I have mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let it be an olive-shaped cautery, as has been previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small, thin cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
On the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize that area with the cauteries which we described in the treatment of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give him something to drink that cleanses his brain, according to what has been explained previously in the division [of treatments].
Then shave the patient's head, and then make a properly-made headband for him on the circumference [of the head], and then place that in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright, and held firmly on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and it is best to use old sheep's fat. And heat that [liniment] over the fire with moderate warmth,  which the said [patient] can tolerate when it is applied to him. Then pour that [liniment] into the middle of his head within the headband, and leave it there until it cools.
And do this to the patient once a week, along with his other treatment, until he is healed; or, if you wish, cauterize that [area] making small punctures according to the need of the patient, but hold your hand with a cautery thus prepared: this is a type of cautery which moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply that cotton soaked in sheep's fat or goose grease.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the cauterization of descending water in the eye.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink that which will purify his head, and guard him from all humidities.
And make him sweat in a bath for several days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on the two temples if the beginning of the descent of water is in both eyes, or on one side if it is the beginning of the water in one eye.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are below the temples; and let the cauteries be far apart in the width of the temples.
And beware of the flow of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see a flow of blood from it, stop it with some medicine, which is possible for you.
And I come with wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and the caution of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below the two bones with two cauteries properly placed.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old tears (likely referring to chronic wounds or sores, possibly fistulas,  given the context).
When the tears from the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest place of the head outside, and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that with the cautery which we recounted in the beginning chapter of water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two bones. And if it needs additional treatment, then cauterize that in all parts of the corner of the eye above the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal odor (or a foul smell from the nose).
When you treat this with what we have said in the division and your treatment is not effective, then you prepare and give the patient the decoctions for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize that with a clove-shaped cautery, with two cauteries above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair.
And beware of the artery, that you do not cut into it.
And this is the shape of the clove-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the cauterization for softening of the eyelids.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize, do so above the two eyebrows a little, with two cauteries on each side, and let them be elongated towards the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand and the cautery, but only enough that a third part of the eyelid is cauterized.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are turned inward and prick the eye.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward so that they prick the eye, cauterization in these cases is done in two ways, for cauterization is either done with fire or with a burning medicine.
If you cauterize with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to shave his hairs like those who cleanse them, until they are elongated and thinned; and if it pricks him near their roots, then you bind his eyes with a bandage so that they are not harmed until the hairs are grown.
Then, when they are grown and thinned, place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with a probe, with a mark which should be according to the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
And then apply lint soaked in egg white or in gum arabic to the eye.
And then heat the cautery, of which this is the form.
And then cauterize over the shape that you have marked, little by little, in many times, until the surface of the cornea which is like a myrtle leaf is burned, entirely and properly apparent.
And a sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and its hairs raised above the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it like that for three days, and then apply lint with a bandage until the scar is healed. And then treat that with ointment until it is healed.
But if some matter returns through the hairs near their roots and the eyelid is softened, then apply the cautery again to that area in the same way as you did initially.
But if the hairs are below the eyelid, then cauterize that until it is raised to its natural place and is even, so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
But cauterize with a burning medicine, that is, instruct the patient to pull the hairs until they are extended and even, and then make a shape like a myrtle leaf from a piece of cloth.
Then take known soap and quicklime, about one ounce, or whatever that is, and mix those ingredients well, and do this quickly so that it does not get cold; then spread this on the cloth that is shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place that over one or both eyes; and place under the eye a cotton ball soaked in egg white, and the patient's head should be in your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it gently, but do not remove it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is like fire.
And so, when you perceive that he feels the bite, then leave the medicine and remove it with your finger; when the biting sensation ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; then observe if you see that the eyelid is now raised, as if it were burned by fire or by incision, for then it is well; and if not, return to applying the medicine to the place where the medicine has not yet taken effect and has not blackened, until your work is even and the eye is contracted.
Then place a cotton pad with ointment on it until the scab from the cauterization is removed, and then treat it with healing ointment or another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, during your operation, to watch with vigilant diligence that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid after a few days is softened and some hair grows into the eye, then repeat your medicine on that softened part of the eyelid, exactly as you did at the beginning, and then treat it again until it is healed.
And this is the method for myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified according to their size and smallness, and therefore your contraction should be adjusted accordingly.
And the path of truth will not be hidden from him who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then you must cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and have a minister hold his head between your hands in such a way that his head is not moved or agitated.
Then place a cotton pledget soaked in egg white or gum arabic on his eye.
Then heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:
which should be concave, like the shape of a cane or a vulture's feather, at the end with which the cauterization is performed.
And if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other end. And if you wish, let it be shaped like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the rottenness from it.
Then place on it the cautery, which should be well ignited, and hold your hand a little below the cautery, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not burn or the patient is disturbed, and then place the cautery on the eyelid and burn it.
And so if at the beginning your cautery penetrates to the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then place on it a dressing with lint and around it with drying ointment until it is healed.
But if ten days have passed and it is not healed, then place on it a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered and is scraped as is fitting in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula which some ancients described:  Locate the fistula and open it, and then place in that fissure a thin tube, which is shaped like this:  And pour into it the quantity of one ounce of molten lead; and hold your hand with the tube with a good grip, and do not move the patient so that the molten lead does not reach the eye of the patient; and it is necessary that you place on the patient's eye a dressing soaked in egg white or water, because lead adheres to the fistula and heals it with marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said of the cautery and the treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a probe through the nose and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose as it will come to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Of the cauterization of the fissure of the wells (or, possibly,  Of the cauterization of the cleft in the  [context-dependent;  'potz' needs further context to be certain. It could refer to a wound, a bone structure, or something else entirely]).
Many times fissures occur on the lips, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the divisions and your treatment does not help, then ignite a small, knife-like cautery according to this form that is shown:
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then carefully place that ignited cautery in those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
Then treat it with cerates until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops and then breaks, and then becomes chronic, and pus runs and a fistula is formed, and you treat it and the treatment is ineffective, then you should ignite a cautery according to the size of the fistula, and then place that ignited cautery in the opening of the fistula, and hold it with your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom, and repeat this once or twice; and then treat it with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
And so if the wound is closed and heals, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone, as will be described in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the cauterization of teeth and the softening of gums.
When the gums are softened by humidity and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and it is ineffective, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then ignite the cautery whose shape will be described below, in such a way that you place the small cup over the tooth and quickly insert the ignited cautery into it, and hold your hand for a short time until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization a few times as needed.
And then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the loose tooth will be fixed, the softened gum will be tightened, and the corrupt humidity will be dried.
Chapter 21.
On the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or worms in it, and you cannot cure it with medicine, then cauterize it in one of two ways: either cauterize with cow dung, or cauterize with fire.
Cauterization with dung is done by taking cow dung and boiling it in an iron spoon, then taking cotton and wrapping it around the end of a probe, then dipping it in the boiling dung, and quickly placing it on the aching tooth until it cools.
And then repeat this several times until the power of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool or cotton in the aforementioned dung, and place that on the aching tooth, and place ignited iron on top of it until the iron reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is done by using a cannula of brass or iron, and there should be some thickness in the core of it so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then ignite the cautery, whatever its form may be, and place it on the tooth, holding your hand there until the cautery cools; and do this several times, for the pain will be relieved either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, after the application of that cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good dung and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cautery.
And cauterize with whichever extremity you wish, as is possible for you.
And this is the form of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Concerning the cauterization of extrophuli (likely referring to a type of skin eruption or lesion).
When extrophuli are caused by phlegm and cold humors and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them lightly, then you ignite the cautery whose form is as follows: having two open ends so that smoke escapes from one end of the cautery, and place that ignited cautery on the abscess once, and again if it is needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in wine over it until what the fire has burned is softened.
And then treat it with ointment and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
On the cauterization of hoarseness and constriction of the throat.
When humidities come upon the windpipe, and especially when this is with a cold constitution, then the patient should be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and then cauterize that below the root of the throat in the affected place.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor burn his windpipe, only a little.
And cauterize that with another cautery near the juncture of the neck at his last vertebra. And his cautery should be a nail according to the preceding manner.
And then treat it with what was previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the illness is chronic, then cauterize with two cauteries on the clavicle in the previously mentioned hollow and prominent areas; and with another cauterization in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a nail according to the preceding form.
And if you wish, your cauterization may be done by puncturing with the cautery that is called a puncturing instrument, the form of which precedes in the puncturing for earache.
And let the points be close to those; and then treat it with the same things that were prescribed previously until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs because cauterization is done with it: with one application you can make three cauterizations according to this form:
Chapter 25.
Of the cauterization of the testicle, which is the head of the helper (presumably referring to the penis).
When the head of the helper (penis) is dislocated due to lubricous humors and is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation until it is accustomed to returning, and then with a small movement it is dislocated again as we have testified, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be turned on his back or on his healthy side; and then raise the testicle which is on the inner side to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated on the inner side.
And then heat the cautery having two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the testicle until it penetrates to the other side; and the figure of the cauterization will then be of four cauterized heads (presumably referring to a four-headed cautery mark).
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place over the cautery cooked barley with salt, and then keep the patient calm, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is strengthened/healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a nail-shaped cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened and the humidity is removed and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and many humors come into the stomach, exceeding its capacity and multiplying within it, and if you continue the methods of treatment and do not cure it, then it is necessary that the patient lies supine on their back, and extends their arms and legs. Then cauterize it with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, to the width of one finger, with a nail-shaped cautery, and with two cauteries below on both sides of the first cautery, so that a triangular figure of cauteries is formed; and space them out so that they are not touching, which would cause decay/rot.
And if the depth of the cautery is two-thirds the thickness of the finger.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery according to the form of a circle according to this form: (The text implies diagrams were present in the original manuscript to illustrate the shapes of the cauteries).
And let the stomach be cauterized, paying attention to what is feared from this cautery: and it is that you mark on the stomach points according to the quantity you wish with a probe, and then cauterize those points with the cautery; and then treat it with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Of the cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain arises in the liver due to coldness, or humidity, or excessive flatulence, so that it is driven from its normal fullness by superfluous egress, and the patient is not cured by what we have said and done, then the patient should be placed supine on his back, and three cauteries should be marked with a probe according to this form and this same quantity on the liver beneath the hypochondria, where the recumbent position of a man is apparent. (Again, this implies accompanying diagrams).
And let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be according to the length of a right-hand finger.
And do not press too much with the cautery.
And if the quantity of that which is burned is the amount of half the width of a finger, and no more, and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, having already extended his thighs, and let him raise his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these areas with a knife-cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the width of a whole finger be burned so that the entire body is burned and it reaches the intestines, because the finger is thin here; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the perforation of an abscess of the liver with a cautery.
When you find a wound or abscess in the liver and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient finds heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the tunic of the liver, the pain is very sharp, and sometimes it even tires the doctors in its treatment.
Therefore, the patient should be turned onto their side; and then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a rake, the form of which was shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until the entire swelling is burned, until it reaches the pus, until blood comes out.
And then treat it with the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that this type of cauterization be used except by one whose study in the art of medicine is extensive, and in whose hands many illnesses have been known; however, someone with experience should sometimes dare this operation, but leave it to us, it is better.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that a cautery made from the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy, according to this manner, is effective.  And this is how you do it: take a long, dry root of birthwort, as long as a finger, and of the thickness of a finger.
Then submerge it in oil and hold it to the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery in the area that is between the continuation of the clavicle and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the chin, slightly inclined towards the area below the beard; and with two cauteries in the area that is inclined between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclining slightly towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and with another on the stomach; and with three cauteries on the back; and with one cautery in the area that is between the two shoulders; and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary to cover your hand with the cautery; rather, let it be manifest in the work of cauterization.
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron similar to a ray [of light], and they heat it, and apply it to the area between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess and healthy tissue is excised, as we have said in the case of an abscess of the liver.
But this perforation with a cautery is not without danger, for you may quickly kill the patient in the place, creating a fistula which is not easily healed.
Chapter 30.
Concerning the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen with what we have said about treatment in the division and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is appropriate in three ways, all of which are correct.  One is to make three or four cauterizations lengthwise according to the length of the spleen, following the shape of the liver cauterizations, the form of which has been previously described.
And let the width between each cauterization be the breadth of a finger or slightly more, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as that which we have described for the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the patient be lying on their side.
And another method of cauterization is to ignite the cautery having two points, which procedure we have described in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the linen which is in the area of the spleen where the patient's left side lies.
And let your lifting of the linen be according to the length of the body, so that cauterizations are made according to the width of the body.
Then insert the two ignited points, very quickly, into that space so that with them you penetrate the linen on the other side.
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus four cauterizations are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three points.
And then you should care for the cauterization after it has stopped emitting pus for many days, for that is more important than the other preceding matters in the cure.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the cauterization of a dropsical person.
Cauterization is not suitable for all dropsies, but only for a specific kind.  (The "3" after "alcinte" is likely a scribal error or annotation.)
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division and your treatment is ineffective, then it is necessary that you cauterize them with four cauteries in the circuit of the navel, and with one cauterization on the stomach, and with another cauterization on the liver, and with another cauterization on the spleen, and with two cauterizations between the vertebrae of the back, and one cauterization on the right foot, and with another cauterization on the stomach. And the depth of the cauterization should be proportionate to the thickness of the skin.
And then leave the cauterized wound open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not deprive the patient of treatment after cauterization with what is necessary, so that two intentions are added to him, and he is hastened towards healing with help. (This suggests a holistic approach, combining cauterization with other therapies.)
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its form is described above; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, as its form is described above.
Chapter 32.
On the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are afflicted with dropsy and are filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the dorsum (top) of the foot, not at the point between the little finger and ring finger, but elevate your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand, and do not completely retract it, for the yellow water will flow out.
The cautery should be of this shape: Then make two cauteries on both thighs, and on each thigh let the cautery be made with the knife-like end of the cautery. And let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh, two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some water drains from it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
On the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is cold and damp to the point that it weakens the virtues, that is, the digestive and retentive virtues which are in the stomach and intestines, and this is treated with methods of cure and does not improve, and sometimes the patient suffers, exhibiting a deficiency of virtue, then cauterize that [abdomen] with a large cautery on the stomach as previously described in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and with four subtle cauteries in the circuit of the umbilicus, with a thin awl-shaped cautery; and with a cautery on the hypochondrium above the spleen, or with two cauteries.
And if sometimes the humors are excessive and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize that [area] on the pubic bone and on the intestines, and quickly apply two cauteries close to the stomach and near the groins, for it is a perfect cure and helpful remedy, from which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
On the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When there are in the nature of old hemorrhoids, one of thick cold humors or of corrupted humors, and they are treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment does not improve, then cauterize with three cauteries on the lowest part of the sacrum, small and slightly triangular, and with a cautery above the umbilicus about two fingers' breadth.
And if you suspect that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face inflamed, then cauterize that [area] over the stomach with a large cautery as previously described; and with one cautery over the liver, and with another cautery over his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the cauterization of swellings near their excision.
When you excise a swelling, then you should use a cautery that resembles a ray (or spoke, suggesting a shape). Then insert that ignited cautery into the excised swelling, and finally use your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do this once or twice, for if the swellings are numerous, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and afterwards treat them with ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on someone, it is slower in healing.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. On the cauterization of fistulas which are formed in the lower parts of the body.
When nature does not obey the treatment which we have recounted in its place, and the patient is afflicted by this, let it be healed with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the lower body, and it is old, corrupted by pus and moisture, then what is most fitting is to probe it with a thin probe, and then ascertain the extent of its depth with the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery which is shaped like a ray. And then insert that heated cautery into this fistula, according to the depth that the probe indicated.
And repeat the cautery application until those corrupted tissues are burned, once or twice or thrice, according to your need.
And beware of burning nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or the intestine, then beware of all those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you believe it is not penetrating deeply.
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the infected matter has been removed, and it remains so for a long time, then know that it is completely cured.
And if the infected matter has not been removed, then know that it is penetrating or the bone itself is corrupted, or this comes from those causes which will be mentioned in their place.
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of sores.
When in sores pain arises from cold or great inflammation, and because of this the patient's body is weakened, then it is necessary to cauterize that area over the sores with a cautery; over each sore with a nail-shaped cautery, the preparation of which will be mentioned later.
And quickly cauterize again a little lower, so that three linear cauterizations result, and then they will be more helpful in healing.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that area in the lowest part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side and with another on the left.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the hazelnut; and cauterize that with a cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a nail-shaped cautery, as is appropriate.
Chapter 39.
On the cauterization of the breast.
When cold and humidity come to the breast, and because of this conception is prevented, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then it is necessary that the place be cauterized with three cauteries in the circumference of the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the place below the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
On the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
When mucous humors are poured into the area of the hip, and are the cause of its displacement, and a sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it hurts.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the affected part of their hip with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the circumference of the affected area as it is swollen, so that the affected part falls in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the kind previously described in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be made according to the quantity and thickness of the whole spine; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the hip area, and it is caused by cold and dampness, the patient is treated with what we have said and do not disagree, and this is ancient practice; then you should purge the patient of thick humors with foul-smelling pills or artificial pills or similar; and then cauterize it.
And the manner of cauterization in that case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
If according to two known methods, of which one is that you cauterize the area of his hip with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make them of good depth. And let the space which is between each cautery be the amount of the thickness of a finger, whether the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes let the cautery be in the middle of the area, on the head of the hip, so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose form precedes in the cauterization of hip dislocation, so that it is a continuous circle and burns the thickness of the entire area.
And this is the method of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is adherent to the hip and not extended to the thigh.
But if it is extended to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, on the place where the patient indicates the pain is; and with one cautery on the groin, four finger-widths slightly below the left side.
And if the cautery is knife-shaped, let the depth of the cautery be according to the amount of the thickness of the area.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is extended to the area near the toes, then cauterize there where indicated with a cautery in three or four points, or more if that is needed.
And if the patient indicates the pain to be below the buttock towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife-shaped cautery.
And be careful in all cauterization that you do not go so deep with the cautery that you burn nerves or large arteries, and that because of this you do not cause the patient harm, such as loss of feeling or contraction (of muscles).
And I have seen one and another of those whom I cauterized on the ankle, and went too deep in the cauterization, and the leg became swollen until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted (decayed/infected). And then a severe case of diarrhea followed, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each according to this manner (method).
And some wise men say, in the cauterization of the ankle, use a cautery of which this is the manner: make a circle of iron whose circumference is half a palm; and let its opening be according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less.
And within that circle let there be another third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of a hazelnut; and let those circles be open on two sides; and let the length of those irons be a hazelnut or two hazelnuts, and make in those irons a properly prepared margin within the circles; and this is its form:
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then let it be placed on the part of the ankle, the patient lying on their side. And then cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave it for three days; then plaster it with a bandage and leave the wound open for many days; and then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says: O, son, we have used this type of cautery little because of the fear of looking at it, and because we have found few who dare to look at it.
But of the good cauteries to him who suffers them, and finds with it the place of it. (This sentence is grammatically awkward and its meaning somewhat ambiguous. A more natural English rendering might be: "But among the good cauteries is one which those who undergo it find effective.")
But cauterization with burning medicines is that you make two circles having a perforated handle in which you place the iron head; the length of the walls in height should be two nuts or something like that.
And if the space which is between each is the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and they are open below and above, and they contain themselves between them according to this form:
Then place the patient on their side over the affected part of the hip, and press your hand on the affected part of the hip; then take hot water and pour it between the two circles, and let the heating be gradual with a small fire, and keep it there for about an hour, and let the patient endure the burning and cauterization—for this feels like a burning—until the burning stops.
Then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe the hot water from the entire hip with fresh water.
Then leave it for three days and apply a bandage until the blackness of the burn is removed, and leave it for some days, and pus will drain from it; this is the last treatment.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the hip or leg, make for him a bath that contains water, following the same procedure as was done for the hip.
And this is the method of hot water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, an equal part of each, and crush them and put them in a new pot, the bottom of which is perforated by a small hole, according to the quantity that will enter the ray [presumably, a body part or instrument].
And place under the bottom of the pot another inverted pot, and pour over the alkali and quicklime fresh water, which will cover them by a finger's breadth, and when you have compressed them with your hand with good pressure, and allow the sharp water to descend from above into the inverted pot below.
And then collect all that water, and pour it over more fresh quicklime and alkali, for then it will be of very strong acidity, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterizing other members, because it works like fire.
And some of the medicines with which it is also cauterized are, thus,  verdigris and honey and quicklime with soap, so that they are mixed.
And Galien recounts the operation and cure of a man from antiquity, with which sciatic nerve and vein pain was cured, and greatly praised this method, saying that it needed no other treatment, and because it was healed at once as he recounted, because he very easily entered the bath and was free of it.
And it is that some fresh rue should be taken, and if fresh is not found, a fresh fig should be taken; and it should be well crushed with a little lard and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and it should be bandaged.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for however long the patient feels relief from the burning.
Then put him in a bath, and when his body is reddened, expose him to the sun, for the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
But already Dioscorides said that when the varicose vein is cauterized with a goat's horn, it profits him very well; and the cautery should be done in this manner: wool should be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the arches of the foot and between the bones.
Then take a dry goat's horn and burn it in the fire until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. Then repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of burning reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this manner of cautery is called cautery of vapors.  (or possibly "cautery by fumes" or "cautery of fumes" depending on the precise intended meaning of "vaquas" in this context).
Chapter 42.
Concerning the cauterization of toothache.
Sometimes pain is in the teeth from various causes, such as from a fall or a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and from causes similar to these, by the infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cauterization is only suitable for that single type which is caused by the effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuation of the patient with purging pills and similar remedies,  cauterizations should be made on the tooth where the pain is, three lines according to its width, making marks with ink on each line for five cauterizations or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and constitution.
And the cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a nail-shaped cautery according to this form:
Chapter 43.
On cauterization at the beginning of jaundice.
This illness often happens to small children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it affects their structure in the wing with elevation and movement.  (The "wing" likely refers to the area around the shoulder or ribcage).
And you find in the last vertebra of the back and the nape of their neck that it already begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And so when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that with a cautery that is circular according to this form: so that the cautery takes in all parts of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with the pointed cautery two or three lines. And let the points be close to each other.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered in swelling that is caused by a spasm of the nerves.
Chapter 44.
Concerning the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which are infused into each member of the body, then when pain comes in the feet, it is customary for doctors to call this gout properly.
And therefore, if gout caused by cold is cured with a method of cure and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is so that you cauterize that near evacuation in the area of the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary that a puncture be made on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise into the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize that area on each knee with three or four cauteries on each side with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize that area, and do not press too hard with your hand using the cautery beforehand; let it be only around the thickness of a finger.
And if the pains rise into both knees, then administer the cautery which we have mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called "suagra" (likely a form of hand ailment), then puncture in the area around the knuckles, as if revolving, puncturing in those two lines.
And if the pains remain in the fingers, then puncture in the area around the knuckles on each finger and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pains rise near to the elbows or muscles in a few days, then cauterize them on every side of the joints.
And do not neglect the patient's good regimen and reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the cauterization of ruptures (or fractures).
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines protrude before the scrotum, and this begins to happen frequently, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to cease eating on that day and that he use lenient remedies so that the rupture descends from his belly.
Then support the patient between your hands on his back, and instruct him to hold his breath until the hernia or the intestine is expelled or appears.
And then return that with your fingers and gently push the rupture back over the pubic bone, noting that the extremity should resemble a semicircle in the upper parts of the body.
And then heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand on the area so that the intestine does not protrude.
And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion underneath; and another servant should be at their legs, and another at their feet, who should hold their hands.
And then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, keeping the cautery straight, and hold it there until you reach the bone of the hip through the middle of the swelling; and do this again another time if you did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And observe carefully the position of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest death or other great harm come upon the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not complete/successful.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small according to their size and measure.
And then care for the cauterized area for three days with a poultice until the burn scab is shed.
And afterwards treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the area and wound are sealed/healed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment according to the length of his treatment, which will cleanse his belly, and that the intestine does not protrude due to the effort of healing.
And then, when he wants to get up after about forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days.
And let him be reduced in work and the fullness of food and drink, and vehement voices, for when he uses this regimen of healing entirely, he will be healed.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the abdomen; and at the beginning, if you want them not to spread, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let that which is exuded from the cautery be like a third part of it; and then treat it with what we have said, and it is well-adjusted.
And some earlier authorities said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape, since it is marked with a probe:
and a line is placed across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
Concerning the cauterization of torsion (or twisting).
When pain develops in some member because of a fall or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cauterization of each limb be according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the torsion and its pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cauterization, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization; for it is customary for such pains to be punctuated from one limb to the one adjacent to it, so it is necessary to treat those with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cauterization, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so, if you wish to cauterize someone, consider whether the leprosy is spreading and whether it can be cured with what we have said in the division and if not, and you fear that the corruption will affect the whole body and its entire complexion, then cauterize the person on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second just below it, towards the forehead at the hairline; and two more on the temples; and one at the back, on the nape of the neck.
And finally, with the cautery, press your hand slightly inwards so that a small impression is made on the bone, and the scabs are removed, so that the expulsion of thick vapors is relieved; and cauterize over the spleen as previously described.
And if the leprosy is already widespread on the patient and manifestly apparent, then you must cauterize with the cauteries we mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the vertebrae near the coccyx, and one on the coccyx, and with two on the hips, and one on each hip, and with two on the buttocks and one on each buttock, and with two on the knees, and with two on the muscles, and with two on the ankles of his feet; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers of the hands and feet, and on each heel of his feet, and on the wrists of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are on the heel, that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pubic bone and another on the stomach opening, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as they do from cuts, because their body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as prescribed by the types of instruments.
Then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour mixed with honey and with other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On cauterization for numbness.
When a limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you should cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. And afterwards, treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes a numbness that extends to the hands and feet, and to the vertebrae of the back, is cauterized near the emergence of the nerves that move that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
But do not attempt this except someone skilled in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of the nerves moving the whole body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of albaras, which is morphea.
When albaras is chronic and you have not administered any medicinal ointments, then cauterize it with a cautery iron a little according to the size of the affected area until the whiteness and its color are relieved and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of barley and lentils with rose oil and with leaves of arnaglossa, and with pigeon's blood or lizard's blood; take a portion of each and mix them all together, and then spread a cloth and place it over the area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around its circumference as it is swollen.
And the learned say that it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery in the middle; but to me this is not advisable, for I fear that it will become ulcerated, and I have already seen this happen several times.
And it is more proper that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 50. (Assuming a Roman numeral system)
Concerning the cauterization of a bubo/swelling.
When a bubo is slow to mature, and this is due to the superfluity causing it, or due to the patient's age—because they are old and decrepit, with little blood—or due to the season, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the bubo; then cauterize around its circumference with many small, pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.
But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the bubo until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in that lower place, so that the body of the arm may be relieved; and then care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the cauterization of a corrosive (ulcer/sore).
A corrosive is a corruption moving in the limb, which corrodes it as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosive in a place which can tolerate cautery with fire, then you should ignite very small, hot cautery nails,  large ones as is appropriate for the place where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it completely until you eradicate all the corrosion and no cause of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and place crushed salt mixed with oil on the cauterized areas until the scabs are completely gone and all the corruption is eliminated.
And then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh has grown where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains in the corrupted areas.
And a corrosive is sometimes medicated with a sharp medicine, for that is a substitute for cautery. But however, cautery with fire is of more readily available help.
And I have already mentioned the treatment of it with sharp medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you have need of it.
Chapter 53.
Concerning the cauterization of wounds and other similar things.
Many times there happens to the parts under the foot a disease that is called a wound, and it is a large, deep wound, which harms the foot; and cautery in those cases is according to two methods, that is, cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
But cautery with fire is that you heat the concave cautery similar to a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size which contains the whole wound, and should be of fine edges.
And then place that heated iron upon the wound, and then move your hand with the cautery in a circle around the wound until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. And leave it there for three days until it begins to shed eschar. And then plaster it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it is not converted, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should administer cautery with water to those areas.  Take a cannula of bronze or iron or a vulture's quill, and place it over the wound; and then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand, and you should move it with the pressure of your hand altogether, and let the edge of the cannula be pressed into the root of the wound, and the hot water will find its way to the root of the wound; and let the patient endure the burning of the hot water for about an hour, and then remove it, for the wound with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this with those and then the others until you have reached all those which are in the body.
And then treat those sores, once the roots of the wounds are eradicated, with those ointments which generate flesh.
Chapter 54.
On the cauterization of tremor.
When someone experiences tremor due to cold in the nerves, or due to a cold fever, or a similar cause, then you should cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the spinal vertebrae, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, using an olive-shaped cautery.
And their tremor will subside, and the healing of the cold illness will be hastened.
Chapter 55.
On the cauterization of accidental swellings in the body.
When swellings appear on the body, and there are pustules and fissures caused by thick, corrupted matter; then, at the beginning, when they appear, it is necessary that they be cauterized on the top of the fistula with a thin cautery, with myrtle wood whose end is ignited with fire; or with long roots of eryngo; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes a cautery is also applied at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner; and they are not believed, and the superfluity is broken up by making those, and it heals from them.  (This line is quite difficult and the meaning is somewhat ambiguous due to the archaic language and possible grammatical errors within the original text. The translation attempts to convey the general sense.)
However, it is necessary that this be done near evacuation with phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
Chapter 56: On the cauterization of bleeding caused by an arrow wound.
Many times, bleeding occurs from an arrow wound which is incised through the wound which comes from outside, or through the incision of abscesses or cautery of the limb, and similarly, and it is difficult to stop that.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you press with your hand on the opening of the arrow wound, and place your finger on it tightly many times until the bleeding stops below your finger, and it does not come out.
Then put small and large olive cauteries in the fire, many in number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then take one of those, small or large depending on the location and wound where the artery is broken,  apply it to that vein quickly after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding is stopped and restrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your finger and remove the cautery, then take another cautery carefully from among the cauteries which are prepared in the fire, and then do not cease doing this one after another until the bleeding is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that another harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop it in those cases, and especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction when it is not extracted, for when it is extracted, its extremities are best burned and the blood is stopped, or that it be tied with thread or with a ligature by strong constriction, or that medicines whose virtue is to stop blood be placed upon it; and they should be held tight with a compress with appropriate constriction.
But he who administers proper constriction with a ligature and with tight bandages or by the application of cauterizing agents and similar things, does not confer it except late.
But if this happens to someone and the physician or medicine is not present, then gently press the index finger over the opening of that vein as we have said, and apply strong pressure to it until the blood is stopped from the main part of the wound, and the finger should not be moved from the artery; and over the artery, let cold water of great coldness be sprinkled until the blood is congealed and thickened; and then consider whether cautery or medicine is needed.
Of incisions and perforations and cupping and of phlebotomy and of wounds and their similars.
We have already discussed in the first chapter every illness in which cautery with fire and with burning medicine is suitable, and the occasions and causes thereof, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have arranged the chapters from the top of the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the one who seeks this may be relieved, then concerning that which he will have requested.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that in this chapter is that which is in the first chapter on cauterization, but in a less frightening way.  (Or: ...but this chapter is less frightening than the first chapter on cauterization.)
And because great caution is necessary, for in the operations which are in this chapter, many times there occurs evacuation which is with blood, with which life is maintained, through the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or purgation of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision of a stone, and the like. And all of these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in most of them there is the danger of death.
And I warn you that this should not happen to you, that is, hesitation, for sometimes you will deal with men with many kinds of illnesses. And some of them are angry with their illness and death is light to them, and this because of the vehemence of what they experience from their illness, and because of the length of their illness, and with the illness is a fear which signifies death.
And among them is one who gives you his possessions and says, you are hoping for his health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore, it is not fitting that you consent to that which comes to you, of which this is the manner; and your caution should be greater than covetousness and your greed; and do not presume any cause regarding this except with certain knowledge which verifies this for you, and to which a praiseworthy outcome follows.
And use in the cure of all your patients prognostication and indication of him to whom health is restored, for in that is to you help in the acquisition of fame and memory, of praise and of glory.
O, sons, may God inspire in you His understanding and not withhold from you guidance and protection, for this is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that that which you ask for and of which you have need may be relieved for you.
Chapter One.
Of the treatment of water which is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth and when the nurse squeezes the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it happens for a hidden cause which is not known.
But I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those whom I saw, death followed, and thus it is in my experience a fatal condition for them.
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always thus enlarged until he could not support himself because of the size of his head, and moreover, the humidity increased until he died.
And this humidity is either accumulated between the skull and the bone, or it is accumulated under the bone on the membrane.
Because if the humidity is between the skull and the bone and the abscess is small, then you should make a fissure in the middle of the head with a cut in the width, and the length of the fissure should be about two finger-widths so that the humidity can drain, and this is the shape of the spatula:
And therefore, if the humidity is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two fissures in this manner:
And if the humidity is under the bone, the sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress it with your hand from the inside, and this is not hidden from you. You should make a cut in the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:
And then extract all the humidity through the incision; and then bind the fissures with cloths and soft feathers; and then wash it with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then untie the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food with little humidity until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore aim with the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do it as best you can.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood, and the patient dies from that blood flow with evacuation of humidity.
Chapter second (or Chapter two).
When a catarrh or rheum occurs in the eyes or feet, and this is chronic, and medicinal cures do not work, then the last resort is incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incise them, the patient should shave their head, and rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and the patient's neck should be constricted with a cloth; and observe where the vein pulsates; and the location of each is near the ears, compressed, and thus hidden except in some men.
Then mark the artery with a probe, and incise each one with a sharp lancet from each side with an incision reaching to the bone, and let this be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and sever it at the incisions above.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers' breadth, because when a vein is incised, the blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which leaps out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure from the ear the distance of three fingers, and mark it with a probe, and cut to the bone.
And the amount of blood that should be let is about six ounces, and quickly let out more or less, and all this is according to the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then examine the wound, and if any cause of infection remains on the bone, then incise it so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And then bind the wound with lint and linen bandages, and treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic migraine or sharp headaches, due to acrimonious humors and a quality in the tissues of the temples, or a similar, longstanding and vehement affliction, and it is treated with medical remedies and this does not help, then we should attempt in these illnesses the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or their cauterization as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hairs which are on the temples; and attend to the artery apparent in the temple, for it is shown to you by its pulse, and is hidden only in few men by the vehemence of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then let the neck of the patient be constricted with some cloth; and then rub the place with a rough cloth or evaporate the place with warm water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you scrape the skin with that [spatula] easily until you reach the artery; and then put in [the artery] an instrument and extract it to the upper parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics which are beneath it, from every part.
But if the artery is subtle, then wrap it with the end of the oncii [a surgical instrument], and then incise a part of it according to the quantity by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and no flow of blood will happen, for if they are not incised the blood will not flow at all.
And then evacuate from one to three ounces of blood.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or with cords at length, and do not allow it to putrefy before the consolidation of the wound and the occurrence of blood flow.
And then incise the superfluity which is between the two ligatures; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are incised, and it will be in place of that same operation.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or a hot complexion; for cautery is one of those things that helps to dry up humors, and therefore is better in that case.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that you clean the wound with old linen, and that properly made powders are placed upon it, and then it should be treated with drying medicines to produce granulation and with dressings until it is healed.
And if while you operate another time, a flow of blood from the artery occurs, then you should take care to restrain that blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the area with linen, and squeezing with your hand until the bleeding is stopped. And if none of those things is at hand, then place your finger on the area until the blood is congealed, and apply water of extreme coldness to the area until the sharpness subsides, and it is constricted as necessary.
And that which is easiest in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and apply each, very hot, until they reach the bone and sever the vein in two places, so that that which is between its extremities is elongated, for they are not completely consolidated by this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. However, if a lesser sharpness than two knives is better, for if they are sharp like two knives close to each other, they will not sever the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since in those there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is retained in them and the flesh is severed easily.
And this method is better in every respect and gentler.
And let the space which is between the two knives be the amount of the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
Chapter on the treatment of sharp and acidic tears from the eyes.
When there are acidic tears, and the source of those is in the veins above the forehead, and you find no cause for treatment in medicine, and sometimes the patient's face reddens and they feel a crawling sensation on their forehead as if it were the crawling of ants, and their eyes are strained, wet, so that the skin around them is swollen, and the eyelids are inflamed by the sharpness of the tears, the ancients used various methods in the treatment of this condition, and I will describe that treatment with a sponge.
And it is that you instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on their forehead, and then incise three fissures on the forehead, equally distant according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure is two fingers: one fissure should be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length, a little from the movement of the muscles which are in the lacrimal area, and the third on the other side.
And be careful of the incisions of the arteries which are on both sides, and extend your hand from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the amount of three fingers, adjusted.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which to dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of its incision: which is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Excoriate with that [tool/instrument] the entire area between the two incisions with the cypha [surgical instrument] which is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove that spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a cuticular knife, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that [instrument] against the flesh attached to the bone, and the blunt edge towards the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision be continued to that part of the bone, and then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, press the places of the coagulated blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a piece of old linen, and put on that powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and see that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day untie the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm or tepid water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the treatment of tears caused by cataracts and descending to the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone has acute and persistent cataracts, and the patient's eyes appear small and sunken, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their skin shed, and there is sharp, persistent pain in the forehead and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the matter and cataracts come from many veins originating in the inner parts.
And the best cure in such cases is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then incise a fissure in the middle of the forehead, a small one in width (and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be between the bones; and extend your hand to the temples' muscles which are swollen from chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth and then fill the space between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton or linen cloths. And then tighten it above with powders boiled in wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And when you unbind it and see that the abscess has diminished, then it is necessary to scrape the bone until new flesh begins to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh, such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and from them an ointment is made and applied to these wounds to promote the growth of flesh.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of what falls into the ears.
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four types: either a mineral stone or something similar to stone, such as iron or glass; or it is from a plant, such as chaff or a bean; or it is a fluid substance, such as water, sour wine, and similar things; or some animal.
And therefore, when a stone or other similar substance falls into the ear, and it does not dissolve or grow in the ear, place the ear in the sun; and if you see the stone, then instill some violet oil or sesame oil into it, and then proceed with its extraction, and induce sneezing with a suitable remedy, and block the nostrils before the onset of sneezing. Then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear upwards, for often it is expelled by these means.
And if it is not expelled, then proceed with its extraction using the instrument called a delicate epicyclic scoop, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the scoop, it is good; and if not, then proceed with its extraction using a thin probe with little doubling.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by this, then make a small brass tube and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear, and seal around the tube with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open except the tube. Then extract it with your breath with strong suction, for many times it is done with what we have recounted.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a small amount of ignited or prepared birdlime, which is used to catch birds, and place that on the end of a thin rod, and then carefully wrap it around that properly placed cotton. And then gently insert that into the opening of the ear, and then dry the ear of its moisture.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by all the means which we have recounted, then you should aim to extract it before it develops into a hot abscess or spasm.
And the manner of extracting it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to the strength of the patient. Then, hold the ear between your hands and turn it upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, below the cartilage, in a well-prepared spot. And let the incision be crescent-shaped until it reaches the stone; and, the stone found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then quickly sew up the incision, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause affecting the ear is a growth that is increasing and swollen, then administer its cure and extraction; but if it does not obey your treatment, then take fine pounded lead according to this method: and apply this to the excision of the growth which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it on cotton pads, and then extract it with tweezers or with a fine instrument, or with an incision as we have said, for its extraction is thus eased.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing as a first remedy, and fill his ear with some old cotton, and lie on the ear into which the water has entered; and if it is expelled by this, it is good; and if not, then take some heated smooth stones and pebbles, according to the length of the finger, and warm them slightly in the fire, and the patient should insert one of these into the opening of his ear and jump on one foot on that side and strike with another stone on the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And if the water is not expelled in this way, take paper or tow and place one end in the ear, and hold the other end to the fire until the majority of it is burnt.
And then put in more tow and do this several times until all the water is expelled, and extract it with a cannula as described above for the stone extraction.
But in the extraction of a creature entering that ear, if it is small, like a fly or similar, cure it as we have said in the division; but if it is large, which appears to the eye, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks, and its cause is the easiest of all the other causes that fall into the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your treatment does not work, then you must expose the ear to the sun.
And so if any cause of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks; but if no cause appears, then take a cannula that is narrow below and wide above, of which this is the form: And introduce the narrow end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and then suck with it with a strong suction, and do this many times, until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not obey you in this way, then you fill and close the opening of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already proven in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion, with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear, be with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and wide above.
And so let it be such that it pushes that which is in the concavity of the cannula towards the outside where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take a rod and wrap its end decently with cotton, and then pour oil into the concavity of the ear, or juice of some herb, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula—and this is in the ear—and then insert the rod with cotton on it and press with your hand, with a moderate compression, until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the ear and the patient feels the oil inside.
And that which is poured into the ear should be warmed a little with fire. And be careful that what you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
On the treatment of ear obstructions.
Sometimes children are born without perforated ears, and this also happens in some adults, an obstruction in the ear canal due to injury or excess flesh in it; and this obstruction sometimes occurs in the beginning of the ear canal which does not allow the passage of air, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.
And that which occurs at the beginning of the canal, which does not allow passage of air, is in the greatest disposition of difficult healing.
And in that which allows the passage of air, you should expose the patient's ear to the sun and observe it. And then if you see an apparent obstruction, open it with a thin spatula, of which this is the form:
If its extremity is small in width, one side being sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be two fingers wide so that it does not injure the ear.
And then if the obstruction is due to flesh grown in the ear or in its canal, then take those with thin hooks and incise it vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is in the opening of the ear, then take a thin, fine rod and heat it slightly with fire, and then place it in the ear canal.
And then if you have felt an obstruction with what the patient easily finds, due to the difficulty of hearing, ease its pressure gently; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a linen cloth according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take some wool and dip it in warm water and sprinkle it with finely ground [substance, likely a powder], and use it; and if you see the ear already suppurating, then you must remove the wool and replace it with other wool which you will wrap in a plaster made with rose-colored oil, until the abscess is reduced; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the other treatment which restricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which appears on the eyelids.
Styes which appear on the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with forceps or with a hook, and incise them with a spatula from their roots, and then place a dressing on the incised area.
But if pain with bleeding occurs, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains from their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often there appears on the eyelids of the eyes some growth which resembles a swelling in its firmness and hardness, and because of this swelling it is called [a swelling/tumor].
And it is an accumulation of thick humidity in the eyelid, below and above.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider then if the swelling originates in that which appears from the eyelid and is spread everywhere; and its cause is slight.
Then make an incision on it lengthwise, and then peel it off completely easily until it comes out, and then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
And if the wound is large, then you close it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, it will not harm you because its ointment restores it and causes it to heal.
And if the growth is leaning towards the inner parts of the eyelid beyond the inner surface, then raise the eyelid and suspend the growth with a hook, even if you need to incise, and press it on all sides, and if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, this harms nothing.
Then, after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with a healing agent until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a stye on the eyelid above the eye.
A stye is a swelling which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and mostly affects children, it aggravates their eyes and causes them pain in the morning; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because of this, for tears flow from them.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and the lower eyelids and eyebrows are moist, which already show swelling, and the imminence of a stye is apparent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the stye within.
And a certain method of operation is this: the patient places their head in your lap, and then you place a linen cloth on them and make a compress, and make a circle according to the size that contains the stye on all sides, and then place that on top and press with your fingers all around so that the stye is aggregated in the middle of the circle, and then make an incision in the middle of that swelling with a lancet, making a slit; and the slit should not be larger than the incision that is made in phlebotomy.
But in the incision, it is necessary that you cut completely until you reach the stye, because in most cases the stye proceeds by incision according to the form of a white swelling.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped around your fingers at the outer parts and roll it between your right and left hand until it is removed.
And be careful not to push too hard in the incision, so that with the lancet you do not reach the eye and damage it.
But if the stye does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then push gently into the incision until the stye comes forth; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in wine and vinegar and place them on the area and compress them with powders.
And some people crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision so that it draws out the remaining moisture.
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs at the site, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of the ways to treat the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes, pustules are born under the natural skin and are chronic, then these harm the eye and cause various illnesses, such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and membranes, until this causes destruction of the eye, which is called a disease of the eye (tactinir), and it is cured in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with sharp medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery; or it is treated by incision and suture; or with cannulas as I will describe.
Therefore, you should place the patient's head in your lap; then, turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned, it is good; and if not, insert a needle into the part where the pus is under the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate through the pus to above, and this should be – near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow – near the hairs, and pull the pus to the upper parts with the eyelid, and turn it with a ray [of light, presumably to better see].
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid under the pustules with a sharp instrument from the greater lacrimal [duct] to the lesser lacrimal [duct]; and then extract the pus and place under the eyelid small pieces of cotton or cloth, and then sew up the eyelid with thread, and it should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be according to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, for this varies in people, for some it is necessary to incise a large amount of the eyelid depending on how much the eyelid is softened.
Then make an incision with the instrument along the two lines that you have sewn, beginning from the greater lacrimal [duct] to the lesser lacrimal [duct]. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, let it be the thickness of a king's [hair/thread].  (The text implies a very thin incision).
Then place the hook in one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape it all, and then join the two lips of the wound with glue or fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and stick any excess thread onto the eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so, and if not, don't worry.
Then leave the stitches in for three or four days, and then take care of it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised due to the sealing of the wound and its aggregation; but suture is better. And thus the ancients said of this (treatment).
However, let there be diligence on the part of the surgeon, and it is a good operation, and let there be no fear in him.
And there is another way to treat (this), which is to make an incision on the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid with three separate and joined hooks according to this form:
But if this is not possible, to hold the hooks, and this is not appropriate, then take a needle which has thread and place it in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and the second thread near the smaller lacrimal duct, and adjust the threads between your fingers with equality, and then with those, with equal elevation, lift the whole fold upon which the incision has been made, as we have described.
And then join the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess forms near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with a plaster and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are inverted; then it is necessary that you use what we have said about incision; but suture in each case is more skillful/artificial.
To staunch bleeding with canes is according to this method: and it is that you turn back the eyelid and incise the growth that is inside as I have recounted; and then skillfully make two small canes or splinters, whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of the space/gap. And you have already incised at the ends of each part, where you have the threads.
Then carefully add each [cane] with subtlety over what is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the canes to each part with a strong binding, and leave it for some days, for the growth, because of the binding, will die and dry out and will rot until it falls off by itself.
But if it is delayed, then break it with forceps, and then cure the wound until it is healed.
Then, once it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of the two canes which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Chapter 12. Of the elevation of prickly hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When unnatural, hard, rough, and prickly hairs are in the eyes, then the operation is that you take a fine needle and place on it a fine silk thread or linen thread, and then adjust its ends very subtly, so as not to harm [the eye] in any way. And let the length of the threads be the quantity of a palm's length.
And then you prepare another short, fine thread underneath, and tie its ends if you wish.
And then have the patient place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
Then insert the needle into the root of the offending hair,  carefully guiding it, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract it above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair out and place it in a container; let there be one, two, or three hairs, but no more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair is completely removed with the tweezers from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if it is pulled with tweezers and the hair is not removed, you will pull the tweezers downwards with force, with the mixture that you have prepared with it, until the tweezers are removed from the hole above.
And observe it with the vision of the eye, for then you will remove the tweezers and the mixture, and you will gently clean and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is very short, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and lift it with that, or leave it until it is lengthened a little, and then you lift it.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the treatment of a sty which appears on the upper eyelid.
When a sty appears in the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound or incision or cautery, and it is called lagophthalmos (leporina), and this condition, whether natural or accidental, is caused by the healing of a wound, incision, or cautery, or by similar poorly treated ailments.
The method of operation is that you should incise that consolidation and separate its lips, and place between them a small piece of linen cloth, and bind them until they are healed.
And it is not advisable that you use treatments that dry or constrict; for if you do this, the sty will return worse than it was before.
Use treatments that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice made from the water in which mallow and linseed have been boiled, or  dyachylon ointment liquefied with some oil, and dip the linen cloth into this and apply it as a dressing.
And the key to your treatment is that you should prevent it from healing in a way that is different from its original state.
And this operation, which we have described, is merely a correction of the sty, so that it does not return to its previous form.
Chapter 14.
On the treatment of a stye which forms on the lower eyelid.
This stye, which forms on the lower eyelid—and is truly called a stye—is of two kinds: natural and accidental.
But the accidental kind is caused by a wound, or a cut, or cautery, or other similar things.
And the method of its operation is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left lacrimal duct to the right, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and sew it with the needle, and incise with a wide spatula. And if the eyelid then returns to its proper shape, it is good; but if not, take a reed and place it in the split, and with it reshape the eyelid, and sew the two fissures in the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two fissures be two angles of the incision, which you have made so that they meet, and let an angle be formed of them so that when they come together a figure is formed from them.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda (Λ).
Then remove the flesh from that side to the extent that the lower edge of the wound is sharp enough to form the eyelid.
Then adjust the separated parts and sew them together with woolen thread; and then treat them with the mollifying medicines and poultices that we have mentioned until it is healed.
And if it is raised by a fissure, suture, or cautery, then you must make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid as previously described. Then separate [the wound] with a poultice between two lips as we have said.
In summary, for the treatment of a [prolapsed] eyelid, whether above or below, perform the operation as prepared according to the form of the eyelid, and that is in a variety of forms.
And the skilled craftsman always prepares the tools in every possible way so that he can return the form to its natural shape, or close to it, and the patient according to what suits him in terms of the operation and instruments, in the best possible conditions.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many people such that the upper eyelid is solidified with the white of the eye and its natural movement and function are impeded, then you must insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up, or spread it with an unguent.
And then you incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharply pointed, but rather blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and keep the spatula from harming the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision carefully separate that adhesion easily until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and the adhesion is completely healed.
And then you apply salt water to the eye with which you wash it; or distil into it some alum dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with a small spatula, and place wool infused with egg white on the eye, and then on the third day use consolidative remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the incision of a nail and the fleshy eminence of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two kinds, for it is either nervous, and resembles a hard, thin shell; or it is non-nervous, resembling a congealed white humidity, which when an iron touches it, or is forced to take hold with tweezers, is cut and the tweezers are not fixed in it.
And both types do not begin except from the larger tear duct, until it gradually covers the vision and prevents light and eye movement.
But the manner of operating in its incision is that the patient should place his head on your lap, and then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand, and then seize the nail with tweezers of little breadth and extend it to the upper parts. Then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or ox hair, or cow hair, or similar, or strong thread, or double the point of the needle little by little and insert it into the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it to the upper parts, and scrape with the hair the edge of the nail which covers the pupil. And thus you follow it with the hair into the back of it.
Then you incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula or with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that continuous flow of tears does not result from the incision of it.
And sometimes the nail, with only tweezers extended, or with thread, as we have said, and then it should be scraped with a lion spatula, of which this is the form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and that a rupture occurs in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then, into the wound, put a little crushed salt or a powder made from cinquefoil, and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, nor is the tweezers inserted into it, then often this type of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed as I have recounted in the division (section).
And if you wish to incise it, then you open the wound of the patient and take a fine lion spatula of sharpened steel according to this form: with subtlety/precision. And if you see that it is rarefied and has receded and roots have grown in it, then distill from your still into the wound a powder made from cinquefoil or with rue or with crushed salt, and occlude the wound until the next day.
And then repeat the operation on it until all that is in it is removed, unless conversely a hot abscess forms in the wound, for then you leave it and cure the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it with reason/judgement until it is healed.
And the prominence of the lachrymal flesh, if it is noticeable in the wound as a great hindrance, should be suspended with hooks; and incise it on one side, and do not extend the incision lest you cut the flow of tears.
And then instill into the lachrymal duct rue and cinquefoil powder until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the incision of a carbuncle and that which is born of flesh fastened in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh is born, and it grows until it covers the pupil, or approaches or presses upon the eyelids, and strongly binds the eyelids to the outer parts and is like the rose of a balustrade.
But the operation is that the patient rests his head on your lap; and then open the patient's eyes and collect all that flesh with suitable forceps for this, and hold it with forceps or tweezers; and then incise the flesh at the beginning until all is finished with the lancet, and be careful of the eye that you do not injure it during your operation.
And let your incision, with which you incise these, be with a spatula, which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which stubble is collected, according to how its form will come to this chapter.
Then, when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or instill into it a red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place a bandage over the outside of the eye with egg white until it is secured from a hot abscess.
And if some cause of granulation remains and hot blood is secreted, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat that abscess with what cures that abscess, and then repeat the operation on it until it is healed, and similarly do with the adjacent flesh which grows in the eye of this kind.
However, you must know that you should avoid all treatment of the weak eye by natural or accidental means, operating with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that that member is able to withstand that operation.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the collection of pus in the eye.
Pus is caused by hardened veins that are located on the eye and prevent the vision from its function and weaken the eye over many days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and has no other disease than the pus; then you collect that pus.
And it is that you instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with an ounce or two, according to your judgment; and let that ounce be of subtle thickness according to this form:
Or two ounces gradually in one body according to this form:
And then let those veins be collected with fine forceps, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those veins being removed from the eye and being pulled out.
And be careful that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is at midday before the sun, and you are very firm in your operation that you do not incise except those veins.
And when you have completed [the procedure], then you distill into the eye verdigris or dew so that with its sharpness it corrodes what has been removed from the eyelid.
But if this is not possible for you, collect everything at that time, and then you plaster everything with something that soothes his pain, and leave it for a few days until his pain is calmed and the danger of a hot abscess is avoided.
And then repeat on him according to the same manner until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
On the reduction of nasal dislocations.
When you treat a nasal dislocation with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as is described previously, and it is not healed, then there is no pus in it, but rather fissures over the abscess before its maturation, and you must extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus until the bone is uncovered.
And then, when the bone is uncovered and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is named a rasp, and it should be made of Indian iron, and its head should be round like a chisel, which should be pointed by filing or sharpened by subtle pointing (as is shown in the following form).
And place that [rasp] on the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Then, if the area is consolidated and good flesh has grown there, and the body of the pus is separated and remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and is not abscessed, and no accident befalls it, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is no other way than to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and according to this method:  that is, you uncover the second bone with an iron or with a sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a trephine according to this form:
Let the extremity of the iron [trephine] be triangular, and its shaft be thin and tapered to the extremity, like this you see here [the text implies an accompanying illustration].
And then place that [trephine] on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and extend your hand a little from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the trephine until it penetrates the whole bone, and the patient will feel this because they will feel air escaping when you have your hand there.
Then restore the area with styptic and drying medicines as has been shown to you.
Then, when the flesh grows and the area is hardened, the matter which flowed to the outside parts returns to the nose, thus this is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the reduction of the prominence of the eye.
When the eye protrudes entirely and is not injured by a wound, diminution, or any damage, then it is necessary to bleed the patient, and then to follow this by placing cupping glasses on the neck without scarification, drawing blood by good suction; and then place on the eye a liniment which should be made of acanthus, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and then bind the plaster firmly to the eye with many powders.
And the manner of the powders is that you take many linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded in four layers; and make of these many layers.  (In other words: use many folded linen cloths as a compress.)
And then place these one upon another according to the quantity that the eye needs. And then bind firmly over these with a strong cloth with a tight binding; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound tightly day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is softened, then it is necessary that it be very tightly bound.
And then remove the bandage during the day and night as we have said.
And if at times the eye is already reduced, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders and the binding and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the incision of the prominence of the uvea. (or Concerning the incision of the eminence of the uveal tunic.)
When there is a rupture in the uvea, and it protrudes and extends beyond the eyelids like a grape, and the human form is disfigured by this, and you wish to incise it, then the operation is as we have recounted, that you insert the needle into the root of the uvea from below upwards, and then place another needle with double thread from the lachrymal side, and make that penetrate and release the first needle according to its position; and then incise the place of the double thread and lift with that the part of the uvea around the needle, and tighten it strongly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white and leave it until the thread with the uvea falls off.
And then treat the eye with something that strengthens it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes gather from all sides with a circle of cloth around the eye a large prominent area, and then it should be perforated with a fine spatula that reaches the pupil of the eye, and runs the albuginous humor, and the eye descends and enters immediately.
And then tighten it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of alconati (likely a type of ailment or injury;  a precise translation requires further context from the overall treatise).
This illness, which is called alconati, is nothing but a swelling which is located in the eye, similar to descending water, but it is not that.
But the method of working on it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight chair, and then take his head in your hands on both sides and gently pull it until you see the swelling descend to the lower parts, and then it should be dried and not descend, and let the light be obstructed, and the patient see things as he used to see.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water (referring to the fluid-like nature of the swelling).
But if the descent of the swelling is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a thin spatula and use it on the pannicle [eyelid],  scraping a little below the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the limbus (towards the empty space), until the swelling is expelled.
Then, when it is expelled, you instill warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have previously boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then it should be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of the watery discharge from the eye.
We have already mentioned the types of watery discharge in the division and which ones it is appropriate to puncture with a lancet, then that according to the state of health.
Then you should make the patient sit between your hands on a chair and tie their healthy eye, very tightly.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their eye, if the eye with the watery discharge is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is the left one; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then place the end of the almond near the cornea, along the thickness of the iris in the white of the eye on the side of the smaller lachrymal gland, and then gently press the almond and rotate your hand with it.
And then penetrate the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached an empty space.
And it should be that the distance of the almond to the pupil is the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, and that is the cornea of the eye; for you will see with that pupil through the vision of the eye by the clarity of the corneal tunic.
And then place the almond into the place where the water is, and then you draw it down one time and then another, and then if the water descends immediately, then the patient sees that upon which his sight falls immediately, and the almond in his eye.
And then rest a little; then if the water has descended, then you remove it another time before the almond is cast out.
And then when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond with ease, and rotate it with your hand little by little, and then dissolve in the water a little clear rock salt and with that wash the eye inside; and then place on the outside of the eye cotton or tow or wool infused in rose oil and egg white and wipe the eye with this.
But we and those who are of our time place over that a finely crushed mixture with egg white.
And if the almond does not obey you upon entering the eye because of its hardness — for there are some men whose eye is very hard — then it is necessary that you take the spatula which is called an alberid, of which this is the form:
And then perforate that joint with it, and do not force your hand into the hole, and it is only that you make a subtle path to the location of the almond.
And then introduce the almond as we have said.
And for the completion of your work, let a sleeping chamber be prepared for the patient, decently made, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark house, and let all movement be forbidden.
And position him in such a way that his body is aligned, and he does not turn his head to the right or left at all.
And let the healing be, according to his constitution, within three days.
And then release him from that dark house and expose him to a gentle view, and let him see some things, and then restore the bandages within seven days.
And it is not fitting that you do this at the hour of the treatments or immediately after the infusion. Having said this, you should avoid this because the water might easily leak due to great and vehement observation/examination.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you should open the wound before the seventh day and treat it with something that reduces the abscess.
Then you cover his eyes and place a mask over his face so that his sight is shielded from him for some days, him being in the dark room.
And then he should be moved gradually from that dark room and gradually return to his activities.
And know that in surgery, the student is not excused from seeing certain things, and then you should be bold in the operation.
And it has come to us from some of those who are in Artach, and some say that fire is made in Ayrac, a perforated pot, with which water is drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read this in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the kinds of cupping glasses, so that he who is ignorant of them may know them:
And they should be made of bronze or iron properly, and their extremities should be of this triangulated subtlety, the sharp end thus, as that is the form.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of rotting flesh in the nose.
When in the nose diverse fleshy growths arise, of which some cause is similar to a very small scorpion, or to a polyp fish; and this illness is called polypus because it resembles that fish in appearance. And from it is cancerous flesh, foul, of dark color; and from it is flesh that is not of dark color, but leonine (lion-like).
Therefore, in that which is in these fleshy growths that are not cancerous or malignant, you should make the patient sit between your hands and place them in the sun, and open his nostrils, and lightly prick those fleshy growths with your nail. Then extract it from the outside parts, and then incise what you have grasped of that with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; for if any part remains from which excision is possible, then you scrape it with one of the fine instruments easily until nothing remains of it. But if it bleeds profusely or a hot abscess forms, then you apply what is necessary; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you incise and cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped and all cavities are removed.
Then let vinegar and water or wine be poured into the nose near the incision. But if the nose is open and no moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you know that it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is rotten flesh in the upper bones of the nose to which excision has not reached.
Then it is necessary that you introduce a linen thread into which some thickness has been added, and tie many knots on it, and place between each knot the quantity of a finger or less, and instruct the patient and introduce one end of the thread into the nose with a rod or with whatever else is possible for you.
And after that is done, let it draw its scent until it reaches the nasal passages and comes out through the throat, for often children at school do something similar, and it is an easy thing for someone who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end coming out of the nose and the other remaining in the nose, and then apply sawdust of meat with the knots that are on the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is already with the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread, and apply to the nose, near the extraction of the blood, a poultice, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that is rotten of the flesh.
Then, at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
But if you need a drier treatment, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument, a head-purger, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make it of silver or bronze, which should resemble a small open lamp, like a small bowl, and the spout similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the head-purger instrument should be flat and open; it should have a handle at the back, with which you hold it when you heat the oil or water, or whatever you want of the juices and extractable substances.
Chapter 25.
Of boils that arise in the extremities of the nose.
Many times a boil arises in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in a few days, so much so that it is very noticeable.
And for that reason it is necessary that you incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate the whole thing. And then place on the area either a cautery or a burning medicine which will stay in its place.
But if its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is hardened,  hard, of a dark color and with little feeling; then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess; for many times he who incises this abscess suffers great harm from it, whoever it was on.
And if the abscess is of a light touch and is not of a dark color, and sometimes incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and cure the place with that which dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Chapter 26. Of the suturing of the nose and the lips and the ear when their continuity is broken by a wound or similar.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, you should have little confidence in that operation except in certain men.
Therefore, when such a thing happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then you should join the two edges of the wound with sutures, and then treat it until it heals.
And if the edges of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each is healed, then you must scrape each part of its apparent surface until blood comes out. Then join the two edges with sutures and tighten them, and over them sprinkle dragon's blood and crushed incense, and place over the powder a piece of diachylon plaster, or of some other of the consolidating plasters, and leave it tied for two or three days, then untie it and change the plaster and leave it until the stitches are themselves cut, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
But the manner of suturing is that you close the solution of continuity either with needles, as we have recounted in the suturing of the abdomen, or close the solution of continuity with thread, as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things which come between the two edges in the inner parts.
Often there appear in many men in the inner parts of their lips certain hard abscesses resembling goose grease, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore, you must expose the lips and slit open each of those hardnesses on all sides, and then fill the place of excision with crushed sage until the bleeding is stopped, and then it should be washed with sharp vinegar and the place treated with something styptic, until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
On the incision of the flesh attached to the gums.
Very often a growth appears on the gum, flesh attached, which the ancients called an albulus; then you must lift that with a hook or hold it with forceps and incise it down to its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
And then place crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders on the area.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it, for after cauterization it will not return.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the treatment of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, rough, sticky, and sometimes blackened crusts are attached, and they become citrine or green, so that corruption reaches the gum and the teeth become loose.
And then you should make the patient sit between your hands and rest their head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those crusts and similar sandy substances appear until nothing remains of them.  Do this to remove the blackness, the greenness, and the others until they are cleaned.
Then, if what was initially present is removed, it is good; but if not, then you repeat the treatment on those teeth the following day, and the second, and the third, until you achieve the desired result.
And know that teeth require many scrapers of different shapes and forms, according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped on the inner part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth according to other forms, these forms of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you will see immediately:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
That you treat the tooth for its pain with all diligence and delay its extraction, for there is no cause that supplants its usefulness when it is extracted, for it is a sublime substance, for which reason its extraction is excusable.
But if the patient is compelled to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is affected, for many times the pain deceives the patient and they think it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and aching tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operations of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which tooth is aching, and you know it well, then you must scarify around the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is separated from the tooth and the gum in every part, and then loosen it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, little by little at first, until you extract it completely.
And then apply strong, large forceps for good traction or firm grip, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold them well and they do not move, and then pull the tooth straight so that you do not break it, nor cause the patient greater pain.
And then, if it is not expelled, then take one of those instruments, and place it under the tooth on all sides easily and forcefully remove it as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or eroded, then you must fill that crack with cloth and bind it tightly with a fine thread so that it is not broken at the time of your tightening with forceps.
And you must open carefully with scarification around the entire gum and take great care not to break it and leave a part of it behind, and return to the patient for the harm which would be greater than their initial pain.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity regarding the extraction of teeth, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great illnesses to men which are more difficult to cure, and their roots remain, all or some of them, or that you extract it with some bones from the jaw as we have testified many times.
And then, after its extraction, the mouth should be washed with warm wine or sour wine with salt.
And if bleeding occurs from this, as often happens, then crush some quantity of sage and sprinkle it on the wound, and if the sage does not help, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and thin tongs with which the tooth is grasped at the beginning should be long in the extremity, short and thick in the handle, so that they do not bend when you have to work with them.
And let them be like tongs with a thick handle so that when you squeeze with them they are not bent, but with short ends.
And let them be made of Indian iron, specifically made with straight ends, and at the ends of those let there be teeth, of which some interlock with others and tighten by strong constriction; and sometimes the ends of these should be in the shape of the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* (that is, a stork), and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the eradication of teeth and the extraction of bones from fractured jaws.
When, in the eradication of a tooth that is fractured, some cause remains, then you should place a poultice of cotton on the area for a day or two until the area is softened; and then insert an elevator or forceps, the ends of which resemble the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* or stork, the shape of forceps:
Let their ends be made inwardly, like a file or rasp.
And if it does not yield to you thus with these forceps or elevators, then you should dig down to the root and scrape away all the flesh and insert the instrument which is called an *atali*, that is, a small lever, the form of which is this:
And let it be of short, somewhat thick extremity, and not be bent so that it is not broken.
Therefore, if by this the root is extracted, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is of a triangular extremity in which there is some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it be triangular and of a more subtle extremity.
And now be helped with this instrument having two prongs, of which this is the following form: and with other instruments which precede in tooth extraction; for help is done with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, and this is the form:
of the triangular, curved or short extremity, which should have some thickness, and not be bent so that it is not broken.
And you should know that the instruments for loose teeth are similar to the other instruments.
But the wise and subtle artisan in the art finds for himself, according to what the operation and the diverse illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses to which the ancients did not assign nor create a proper instrument, because of the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth is broken, or if it is possible, then let it be cured in that place with what is convenient for it of the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help yourself with a splint of which this is the form:
And let there be some thickness little by little, and let it be tightened or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely set; and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this.
But if there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape away that rottenness and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth that protrude above the others.
When teeth protrude, not following their natural course, their shape is irregular, and this happens more often in women, and especially in elderly women; therefore, you must consider: if a tooth is next to another tooth and  extraction or filing is not possible, then remove it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you should incise it with an instrument which has this shape; and it is similar to a boar's tusk, and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp point.
And let your incision, with which you incise it, be done in several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other teeth are damaged.
And if the protruding tooth can be filed down, then file it with an Indian iron file of this shape:
And let it be entirely of Indian iron and very smooth; and let it have very small points, like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days easily, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. Then smooth it at the end, and scrape it with some razors.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and hurts the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and is filled so that the tongue is not injured and speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and loosening due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats, and you have treated it with styptic medicines, and your treatment has not worked, then to prevent them from falling out,  they should be bound together with gold wire, and not silver, because silver turns green and almost crumbles after a few days, but gold is never changed.
And let the wire be of such fineness and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the method of tying is that you take the wire and pass the double of it between two healthy teeth, and then you make two turns of the wire between the damaged teeth, whether one or more, until the wire reaches a healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving back to the point where you began, and tighten it gently and skillfully until it is firm.
And let your tightening, with which you bind the wire around the roots of the teeth, be such that it does not loosen.
And then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and smooth those ends at each location with a file, and bend them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightly bound.
But if it is loosened or broken, tighten it or them with another wire in the same manner at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, thus as you see them bound:
And when it is done that one or two teeth are returned to the place of each in their locations, and are grown back as we have recounted, and that they are remade/repaired.
And this is only done by good and skilled artisans.
And sometimes some material from cow bones is suitable, and it is made from them in the form of a tooth, and it is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and it is fastened as we have said, and it remains and serves with that for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which is in the tongue and prohibits speech.
This ligament, which is under the tongue, is sometimes natural, with which one is born, or accidental and occurs due to a wound which has already healed.
And the operation on it is that you open the patient's mouth, their head being in your lap; and raise their tongue, and then incise that nervous ligament according to its width until the tongue is freed from its constraint.
But if in that area there is some hardness or knotting, and this is due to the healing of a wound, then you should make an incision and divide it across its width until you have cut the ligament and the knotting is dissolved.
And be careful that no fissure is made in the depth of the flesh and that you do not cut too deeply and cause bleeding.
Then wash the site of the incision with warm water or with sour wine or with cold water; and then place under the tongue lint; that is, a piece of cloth which the patient should keep under their tongue each night so that it does not heal together again.
But if bleeding occurs, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a lancet-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess resembling a small tumor occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and it is quickly enlarged until it fills the mouth.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, sitting in front of the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancerous.
And if it is tending towards white, and contains moisture, then you place the hook there, and incise it with a fine scalpel, and incise it on all sides; and if blood flows during your operation, then place crushed verdigris (or vitriol) upon it until the bleeding is stopped.
Then return to your work until you have completely removed it, until it is washed with sharp vinegar and salt; and treat it with the other appropriate treatment until it is healed.
Chapter XXXVI.
Chapter XXXVI.  Concerning the extraction of an abscess from the two ears, and of that which is located in the throat, and of other abscesses.
When a goiter develops in the throat, these are glands that are gathered together like cotton, which protrude outwards and are called "two ears"; if you treat them with what we have described in the division and it is not healed, then you should consider whether the abscess is hard, dark in color, and insensitive. If so, do not touch it with an instrument.
And if it is red and the root is thick, then do not touch it with an instrument because of the flow of blood; rather, let it mature, and then you will either remove it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white, soft, and its root is thin, then it is something that should be incised.
And the operation is that you should consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has already matured through complete rest, or if it has diminished in any way; and then have the patient sit before the sun, their head in your lap, and open their mouth. Then the assistant, holding the patient's tongue down with their hands, using a very fine instrument of which this is the form:
And let it be made of silver or brass, and let it be as thin as a knife.
Then, as you press the tongue down with it and the abscess is shown to you, and you cast your gaze upon it, then take an ounce and place it in the almond, and pull it outwards as far as you can. Furthermore, if you pull out some material from the tunics, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form:
Furthermore, if you pull out some material from the tunics, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to forceps, however its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be made of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a spatula of which this is its form: And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one side, incise the other in the same manner, and immediately after the incision, let the patient rinse with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, rinse with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and similar styptic substances until the flow of blood is restrained, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two behind the ears, and incise these in the same way as I have described in the incision of the two sides equally.
And I myself once treated a woman with an abscess which had formed in her throat.  This abscess was dark in color, almost insensitive, and had already closed off her throat, so that the woman breathed with difficulty. I had already forbidden her to eat or drink water, and she would have died within a day or two if I had not intervened.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had formed two points, ready to burst through two openings.
Therefore I treated it with a fistula and inserted an instrument into one of the openings, and pulled it out.  A large portion was drawn out, and then I incised the part of the abscess that communicated with the other opening. Then I opened the mouth of the abscess, compressed her tongue, and finally inserted the instrument into that abscess.
Then I excised a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore, the woman's throat was completely cleared, and she immediately began to drink water and then eat food.  However, I continued to incise the abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess formed in its place, which I incised until it was completely eliminated.
Then I carefully cauterized her throat; this stopped the addition (of further problems). And afterwards I wandered and did not know what God would do about it with me.
Chapter 37.
Concerning the incision of a uvula when it is abscessed.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is abscessed and elongated, then it is called a perpendicular (abscess). And if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a bubo.
But if it is cured with what we have said in the division, and your cure is not effective, and you see that the already existing cauterized abscess is small and subtle, then you should incise that which is round and aggregated; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, of dark color or black, and there is no feeling in it, then you should attempt its incision, for in that case there is danger to the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner I have described, its whiteness and length, make the patient sit and press down their tongue with an instrument which follows its form, and then place the lancet in the uvula and draw it downwards, and incise it with one of the two instruments which are described in the incision of the tonsils.
And it is necessary that you not incise it except that which is exactly on the natural limit without addition, for if you incise more, you will impair his speech.
And after the incision, use what we have recommended in the incision of the tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, it is necessary to use skill in cauterizing him without causing fear, and the method of cauterization is only with sharp water (likely a strong acidic solution), and it is that you place the patient's head on your lap, and then press down their tongue with the instrument we have mentioned, and then take the water which we have described in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with a live coal, and do not apply it thickly or thinly, and with it fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the form:
Let the extremity of it be a concavity in which the medicine is placed, like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and let the patient lie on their side so that saliva or mucus from the mouth runs out because of the caustic medicine, so that nothing of it descends upon their throat and harms them.
And then hold your hand with the medicine, and press it on the uvula for half an hour until you see it become blackened and dried by the action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and insert the spoon with the cotton into a cannula, so that the cotton adheres to the cannula, and do this as many times as necessary until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it, for it will dry and fall off in about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and after the cauterization wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in wine, and cleanse with it what remains around it from the medicine, and wash it with cold water, and treat it externally with an embrocation, and internally with gargles until it is healed.
And this method of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with a method gentler than cautery or incision, for it is cured by fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, dried Arabic gum, chamomile, and similar herbs, and mix all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them in sharp wine, and boil; and the pot should be well sealed with appropriate lute, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hole, over which a concave brass instrument is placed in this manner; it may be made of silver or brass.
And insert the end into the patient's mouth so that the vapor may reach the uvula through the cannula, until the uvula is sufficiently fumigated.
And then repeat this many times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of an abscess, for it would aggravate the abscess too much, and you should not do this, but rather cauterize the declaration of the abscess.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a reed and fashion a hen's egg shell at its end, so that the patient's mouth is protected, for the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is salutary.
Chapter 38.
Of the extraction of spines and that which adheres in the throat and of other causes.
Many times something adheres in the throat, a fish bone, or some other thing.
Then it is necessary that you extract that which is apparent, upon which the eye falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument in front of the sun, so that it may be declared to you what is in the throat.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for very quickly the thing attached to the throat will be expelled by vomit; or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dry sea sponge, bind it tightly with thread, and then let the patient swallow it, for when it arrives at the place where the spines are, it will extract them and they will be expelled. And further, take an eel, and bind it with thread, and let it be put inside and quickly extracted; or take a leek and quickly insert it and quickly remove it.
But if it is not expelled by those things which we have said, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be thicker than a finger, and at its end let there be a concavity which you insert into their throat with ease.
And let him have his head raised, and be careful not to touch his throat bone, so that it does not harm him, and with that, push the bone or spine, or let the physician do it with his hand.
But however, it is better that the patient himself insert it, because of his knowledge of the location of the affected area, and push downwards, and pull his hand up with the instrument, all this according to the amount that is prepared for him until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of a leech attached to the throat.
When a leech is medicated with what we have mentioned in the section on treatment with medicines and it does not work, then consider applying it to the patient's throat in the sun, after you have compressed the patient's tongue with the instrument which we have recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with delicate, appropriate movements.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and detaches from the throat), and abstain the patient from water all day.
Then take a vial full of cold water, and open the patient's mouth into it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not swallow anything from it and constantly stir the water with your hand, because the leech, as soon as it feels the water, will fall off.
But if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with cymene or with asafoetida, using the instrument we recommended for fumigating the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall out.
And another method of operation in fumigating it, is that you take a pot in which there are ignited coals, and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which there is a hole, and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then let the fumigation proceed; and let the patient put his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, because the leech will immediately fall.
And if it does not fall, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and eating salty things and garlic, and do not drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen it will be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is extracted from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps like this, except that there is some curvature in it: which is placed in the throat, and its end is similar to a stork's beak, which is hollow, in which there is a roughness of filing, so that, when it compresses something, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and on their incision.
Abscesses are of many species, of many manners, according to what their remembrance shows, of each one in this book.
And they are diverse in perforation and incision of them by two manners, of which one is by the species of abscesses in themselves; and by what we understand of the humidities.
And the second manner is concerning the locations in which they happen in the body, because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in a joint; and to each of them is its own judgment for operation.
And moreover, of abscesses, there are some which it is necessary not to perforate except near the maturation of the pus in them or their completion.
There are other abscesses which it is necessary to pierce when they are raw, and are not matured according to their completion, just as abscesses that are near the joints, because when an abscess is near a joint, its being is prolonged until that which is in its circuit can be purified, and very quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, wherefore there is caused a contraction of that member; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay its perforation until it is matured, it will harm the principal member; or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it unmatured; and it is not necessary to perforate it raw, of uncompleted digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that its matter may not fester and be elongated to the inner parts of the anus, and a fistula be formed, or that it be done in such a way that it may not be healed. But it is necessary that you know the time of the perforation of the abscess, and this is when it is matured.
And know that it is matured when there is the abatement of the pain and the cessation of the fever, and near the diminution of the hardness and of the pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know how to make the perforation fall in the place lowest in the abscess and from where the healing matter comes from the prominence.
And the perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the place of the tendons, of the cords of the nerves, of the arteries; and finally, in all even places in which there is no reflection; because in those that are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better that you leave the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed according to the completion, as we have said; for if you perforate it before that, the course of its pus and much filth is prolonged, and quickly its lips are hardened and its depth increased.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body because of necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and in large abscesses a large and wide perforation, or many incisions, according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses in which it is necessary that the head be hollowed and incised, when it is made like bread and is ripe, as that which happens in cases of swellings and buboes.
And those are incised with a three-angled incision; and those which are incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the armpits.
And there are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered, and similar to those.
But that which is not like the aforementioned superficial abscesses, you must perforate it with only a superficial or flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should perforate it and do not try to extract all the pus at once; having extracted a part of it, then pack the abscess until the next day, then extract a larger portion, and then do this many times gradually until it is all discharged.
And especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in decrepitude, because the animal spirit is often dissolved with the exit of the pus, and the patient dies very quickly, and you will have opened them [the abscesses].
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and concerning your perforation in which you perforate these abscesses, you must clean the wounds and consider whether the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision; then you should apply lint or old linen; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you should place lint in each opening until they come together.
And if a part of the skin is cut off in the abscess, or you have hollowed it out in a circle, then you should fill it with old linen or thread made from linen cloth, as when you have extracted splinters or roots, without moisture; and bind it tightly until the third day; and then proceed with this and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and sour wine in which you have soaked a linen cloth, and apply this to the site of the bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must apply the regimen and treatment and powders which I have recounted in many places in this our book and division [or section].
But if it is wintertime, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you should mix powders in warm wine and oil, and apply these to the area.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders soaked in water and oil or in wine and oil, and all this should remain cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should open the abscess and clean it and administer to its treatment what is appropriate for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally; but according to the way of distinction, I have already spoken of each abscess and how to treat it in separate chapters.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the back of the head.
In the back of the head, small abscesses are found, a type of node which contains membranes on their surfaces; and their appearance is varied.
And they are purulent, and those contain a humidity similar to slime. And some of them contain a humidity similar to pus, and resemble it; and some are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all, and in the extraction of them, there is no fear, since the extraction of them does not cause contrary effects.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is similar to this, which is called a probe, until you know what it contains.
For if what it contains is humidity, then incise it lengthwise with a superficial incision according to this form:
And begin the incision from line B to line G.  Then, when the humidity is evacuated, you should scrape the area that contained that humidity, and do not leave any of it at all, for it often returns if any of it remains.
Then immerse a swab in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in salt water; and fill the wound with it and leave it there until the next day, for this will corrode everything that is rotten from that membrane.
And then repeat applying the swab with Egyptian ointment a second and third time if needed, until you are confident that there is no rotten part of that membrane remaining; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you should incise it in this manner: with an incision in the form of a cross, and insert forceps between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from all parts, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane which contains it.
But if this procedure proves contrary to your expectations, then do what I recounted to you at first.
And similarly proceed with a stony abscess in its incision and treatment as we have told you; and the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes some of these abscesses, which are in the head in some men, have absolutely no moisture; the reason is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a dull, rough, white stone, which could not be crushed, and if someone were struck with it, it would hurt them.
But in other accidental abscesses in the head other than this, this is not the chapter, such as the abscesses that occur on the heads of children and behind the roots of the ears; however, the incision of all of these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation of those in the lowest part of them so that the body is relieved of the pus in the lowest parts.
And then treat those with what is appropriate for that treatment.
Chapter 42.
Chapter 42.  On the incision of scrophulas which occur in the neck.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck and armpits and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those which occur in the neck, many are generated amongst themselves, and each scrofula of these is within its own proper sheath, and just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for some of them are stony, and some of them contain humidity, and some of them are malignant which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that which you see to be of good disposition on touching, of which the color that is manifest is close to the color of the flesh, and is soft in every part, and is not connected to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not deep, it is necessary that you incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body, from the line G to the line B, and scrape it from every part, and extend the lips of the flesh with hooks, or with many hooks if you have need of them, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is most important that the vein or nerve not be incised.
And let the instrument not be too sharp, so that it does not hurt your hand with the incision, or that it disturbs the patient, and that you incise only what is necessary to incise; for if you incise a vein or artery and are forbidden from your operation, then place on the wound crushed vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides and the wound is softened and begins to be suppurated. When the blood is cut off.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire with your finger if there is any cause of other small scrofulas, then incise those and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, then it is necessary that you not incise that scrofula at its root. Beforehand, it is necessary that you tie it with strong doubled thread and that you leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then cure that.
And if you incise the entire scrofula, then it is necessary that you join the two lips of the wound and stitch it as soon as there is no remaining superfluity.
But if you see that there remains superfluity because of the size of the scrofula, it is necessary that you understand how to incise the root of it, and extract it and administer suture and what has been said.
And that of the scrofulas which contains humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation where the place of its maturation appears to you, and place the perforation so that it is the lowest part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer a perforation, perhaps with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound already cleansed, then you cure it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the boil or abscess occurring within the throat.
The ancients described this incision in the boil, and no one in our land has been seen to have performed it.
And this is the description/writing of the speech/discourse of those (ancients).
But in men having a hernia, the extraction of the boil should be avoided, lest harm be done, because all the veins and major blood vessels of the patient are there.
But in those who have abscesses located in the mouth or throat or ears, when the disease is not in the [throat] pipe/windpipe, it is necessary to use the incision of the boil to avoid the damage which is caused by perforation.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the boil below three circles of the circles of the boil, or four, with a small incision in width in the area between two circles; to a degree that the incision is in the fatty tissue, not in the cartilage.  And this location is suitable for incision, because it is free of flesh and its blood vessels are far away.
And if the physician is timid/fearful, then it is necessary that he extend the [muscular] sheath of the throat with an instrument (oncium), and then cut the sheath until he reaches the pipe/canal, but he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
And then incise the fatty tissue as we have recommended; and the incision of the pipe/canal is indicated by the inflammation which has emerged from it along with what has burst from it and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time has arrived in which perforation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound's sheath, and sew that alone without the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the discourse which we have recounted, is an explanation only that you may see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the gullet of the patient, and the patient has come close to death, and their throat is obstructed, and some go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient may breathe through the place of the wound for some respiration, and be saved from death.
And for this reason I order the wound to be left open until the malice of the illness is consumed; and its malice lasts for three days; and then I order the wound to be sewn, and cure it until it is healed.
And this which I have seen with my own eyes, is that a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and incised with it a part of the windpipe, and I was called to her cure, and I found the throat as it is swollen by a bite, and I uncovered the wound and I found blood which had issued from the small wound.
Then I was confessed that she had not incised a vein or artery, and wind was issuing from the wound, and I cured it until it was healed.
And nothing happened to the servant except hoarseness in the voice, and after a few days she returned to better disposition.
And now I say that in the section of the epilepsy there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Chapter 44. Of an incision on an abscess which occurs in the throat externally, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess called throat hernia is a large abscess according to the body's complexion, and it is common in women.
And it is of two kinds, for it is either natural or accidental.
And the natural one cannot be cured.
And the accidental one is of two kinds, of which one resembles fatty nodes, and the other kind resembles an abscess which is formed by the knotting of an artery, and in this there is danger. And one should not be presumptuous with iron except in the case of a small one. (referring to the abscess) And you probe it and investigate it with your finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you incise it as with nodes, and extract it with whatever is contained within it from the skin and the blister; and if not, then its whole being should be examined, and treat the place with whatever is necessary for healing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
On the incision of the types of nodes.
There are many types of nodes, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division (of chapters).
And it is necessary that I recount thus the difference between a node and an abscess, lest there be doubt.
Therefore I say that with an abscess there is heat and fever and vehement pain until the boiling of the superfluity is settled; and putrefaction is complete, then the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that lymphatic humor which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a swelling and is formed like a vesicle, either larger or smaller, and they are of two types, for they are either fatty and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division (of chapters).
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a node, you must remove that and investigate that at the beginning with an instrument which is called a probe, according to how its form will appear in the chapter which is near this one.
And the manner of investigating abscesses and all nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you will revolve your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the pus.
Then place your hand around the abscess according to its size, and then remove the probe and consider what has come out in its wake.
And if the flowing humidity, whatever its color, is expelled, then you should incise it with a superficial incision as I have said in the case of other abscesses.
And if you find no humidity in the wake of the probe, then know that it is a tumor (or swelling).
And incise it with a cross-shaped incision in this manner: as I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and easily scrape the skin from all sides, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract the pus with a knot.
But if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the pus, and this often happens; and then you should extract it in pieces until nothing remains.
Because if anything remains, little or much, the swelling will return all the more.
And if you see that a small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and bind the wound tightly, and apply a hot poultice over it, and treat it with another cure until it is healed.
And if it is a large swelling, then you should sew the two lips of it together and treat it so that it grows flesh.
But if a pulsating vein is opposed to it, or a non-pulsating one, then you should consider and fill the place with crushed vitriol and leave it tightly bandaged for two or three days until the wound dries and the boiling of the blood subsides; and then return to incise what remains of the swelling.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of the instruments necessary for incision and perforation.
Of these are the forms of the instruments, and they are of three types: some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
Let them be made of iron, of polished steel, with appropriately squared ends, so that they may easily enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called *albered*, and one of them is called *berid*.
And they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
The form of the large instrument, its form:
The form of the medium instrument, its form:
The form of the small instrument, its form:
It is fitting that they be used for those abscesses and discharges and fistulas and buboes, because among those are those from bones and other causes.
And they are made round, thick, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and are made of latten, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver. And the best are those made of latten.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are suited to opening fistulas in whose cavities reflections are present, so that they may be reflected with their lightness by those reflections.
And they are of three kinds, for some of them are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its stricture.
Form of the large lead instrument:
Form of the medium lead instrument:
Form of the small lead instrument:
The forms of the hooks are of many kinds, for some of them are simple, which have only one curve, and are of three kinds: large, small, and medium.
And of them there are curved hooks, and they are of three kinds.
And of those there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds.
And of them there are [hooks] having three curves, and they are of three kinds.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small simple hook, its form:
Shape of a large hook having two curves: Shape of a medium-sized hook having two curves: Shape of a small hook having two curves:
Shape of a large hook having three curves:
Shape of a medium-sized hook having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are incised and scraped, and they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The ends of those [scalpels] with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp, and they are not positioned in such a way except so that there may be ease in the scraping of the nodes, the fear of incision of a vein or nerve, and so that by means of these the patient may be healed and find a little tranquility through the cauterization which is found after the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the shapes of the cauteries, and there are three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of bronze and resemble a ray, with which alcohol is made.  (The reference to alcohol here is likely inaccurate, as the process of alcohol distillation was not widely known in the medieval period.  It likely refers to something else made using a ray-like implement, perhaps a medicinal preparation).
And it is at the extremity, the pointed part hidden by a spatula, and in that way it touches the internal and external parts, when you wish, as you see.
The shapes of spatulas, which are hidden among the fingers during the perforation of abscesses and the patient does not perceive them, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those:
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is stopped, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They should be made of bronze or copper, round with some length, and thin.
And it is necessary that there be these types of cupping glasses: large, medium, and small, so that with them you can stop the flow of blood quickly if necessary, and then when it is not initially a medicine.
However, do not use these to draw blood from every part of the body, but only in fleshy places, such as in the muscles of the legs and thighs, and in the muscles of the arms, and of the breasts and abdomen and knees, and similar fleshy, moist muscles.
And sometimes other small instruments are made, similar to small, pointed tubes, according to this form; by means of which blood is drawn when it is done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round according to this form:
Chapter 47.
Concerning the care of men's breasts which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become inflamed due to the habit of sleeping, and then the breasts become inflamed, and resemble the breasts of women, and remain inflamed and ulcerated.
And for one who has this, it is necessary that you incise it with a lunar incision according to this form, from line B to line G, and then scrape away the entire thickness, and then fill the wound with incarnative medicine, and then approximate the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the breast droops downwards and is softened by its size, as happens in women, then let it be incised in its two upper parts with two incisions similar to a lunar figure, each of which is contained within the other towards the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from line B and line G. And then scrape the skin which is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about the suture and the powders, that which is necessary in the treatment until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what needs to be incised because of the patient's unease, and because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the perforation of abscesses that appear under the armpit.
These abscesses that appear under the armpit are a kind of scrofula, hard, and containing a sac-like skin.
And some of these contain humidity; and those that contain humidity should be incised with a lunate incision according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then you fill it with old linen and leave it until the next day.
Then the linen should be removed and it should be treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the kind of nodes and scrofula, then you incise it as we have said in the section on scrofula.
But if the wound is so extensive that it begins to fester, then apply cautery as we have previously described.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur from an arrow wound or a vein.
When an arrow is broken and the shaft that remains is consolidated, then often an abscess occurs. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are from an artery or vein are these:  because when the abscess is from an arrow wound it is long and aggregated in the front of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a creaking sound within it.
And that which is from a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision of this abscess is harmful, especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large, therefore its treatment with iron should be avoided.  And that which is in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
But concerning that which is from them [abscesses] by inflammation of the opening of the arrow wound, make a lengthwise incision in the shaft; and then open the incision with hooks and remove the arrow, and free it from the tissues until it is uncovered.
And then place a needle on it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the arrow with double thread in two places— which method I have shown you in the extraction of two arrows which were in the temples.
And then puncture the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood which is there comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment in which pus is generated until the ligaments fall away; and then treat it with ointments suitable for this until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess from a severed vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand that which is possible of the abscess with the shaft, and then insert the needle below the place which you have held under your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be double thread on it so that you extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with good ligature according to what I have told you in the ligature of a grape [presumably referring to a previous example using a grape as a visual aid] in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that you will pull out the thread, then insert the thread with that needle below all the abscess through the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until, when that which is in it has come out, then you incise the superfluity of the shaft, and leave that which is tied from it.
And then place on it a powder which you have submerged in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is done with poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess which happens through the twisting of nerves.
Just as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, similarly abscesses occur in the nerves when they are struck or when excessive labor occurs, and similarly.
And it is made worse in the places of the joints or of the heel, or in any place where the joints are injured.
And the abscess is serious, and it resembles the color of the other body, and is in the worst of its dispositions, and when it is squeezed with force, the patient feels a kind of numbness.
And the abscess is not located in the front of the body, and therefore it is below the ribs, and it is injured in every part and does not spread to the front or back parts.
Therefore, in those [abscesses] that are in the joints, it is not appropriate to use iron [instruments], because contraction will quickly occur.
But that which is in the head or on the forehead,  bleed it with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then take it with forceps and excise it from the roots.
And if it is large, then you suspend it with a hook, and flay it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the area that happens to be in the abdomen.
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, those things which are called fungi, by similarity to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and the lips of these are convex, and some of these are small, and some of these are very large.
And I have already seen one, and in his belly were two things which were very similar to fungi, and there was no difference between them, white, with thin roots.
And the lips of these were turned inward and split, and humidity flowed from them constantly.
Therefore I incised them and found in one eighteen ounces of pus, and in the other six ounces.
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider then if the patient is humid, and the color of the swelling is white, humid, with a subtle root; then you incise it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries in the fire in your presence, because many times from the section of it much blood is expelled; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take freshly made lead plaster, and bind the swelling with it, in the manner which we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to tighten the lead strongly over the swelling, until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort.
But if the swelling has a thick root, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and dread, and especially that which is in the belly.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to incise a swelling which is dark in color, insensitive, and of little growth, for that is probably cancerous.
And I bring to mind a crab in connection with this.
Chapter 52.
On the treatment of a protrusion from the umbilicus.
A protrusion from the umbilicus is caused by many things; either by fissures of the peritoneum which is over the belly, and from it the intestine or bowel protrudes as happens in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery as previously stated, or by constricted wind within it.
But if it is due to a fissure of the peritoneum and a protrusion of the intestine, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the egress of the bowel, then its location is as we have recounted, with more vehement variety, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and it returns; and it is easily replaced, and is greatly increased by the introduction of a bath and strenuous work.
But if it is due to humidity, then it is soft and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is it swollen.
And if it is due to blood, then the swelling appears with these signs, inclining towards blackness.
But if it is due to rotten flesh, then the swelling is heavy, large and hard, and is located according to a certain quantity/amount.
But if it is due to flatulence, then the touch of it is soft.
And the operation in it is that you consider then if the prominence of the umbilicus is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or due to flatulence; then it is necessary that you are prohibited from the treatment of it, because in that there is fear and danger as I have taught you in the chapter in which I discussed swellings from arterial and venous blood.
And if the prominence of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or the membrane, then it is necessary that you command the patient to hold his breath, and to lie stretched out; and then mark with a probe the circumference of the whole umbilicus, and then command him to lie between your hands on his back, and then encircle with a broad spatula the circumference of the umbilicus over the place which you have marked with the probe; and then extend half of the swelling to the upper parts with an inch or so; and then bind it in the circumference with strong thread or with a bandage, and the manner of binding properly.
And then open the middle of the extended swelling above the ligature and insert your finger into that opening and seek the intestine; and if you have found it and secured it by the ligature, then you extract gently and push the intestine into the inner parts of the belly.
And if you have found the membrane, then take that with forceps; and incise its superfluities.
But if it is contrary to your [expectation of finding] artery or vein, then encircle that spot, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and put in those two strong threads and insert the two needles into the circumference which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, which you should make penetrate; and then tighten the swelling in four parts above the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh may dry and fall off by itself; or incise that when it is thinned and dried, and then cure that with what is necessary of ointments until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the umbilicus is of raw flesh there or from humidity, then it is necessary that you concavate the swelling as we have said and extract the blood or the humidity which you find there, and then cure that with what is necessary and that consolidates the place.
Chapter 53.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already spoken, in the division, of the type of cancer and in what manner it is possible to cure it with medicines, and that it is avoided in it, the cure with iron, so that it may not be ulcerated; and we have said that cancer is generated in the mother and the caution of its cure.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, as in the case of cancer which is in the breasts or in the groin and similar members, to extract all that, and especially when it is small and beginning.
But when it is old and large, one should not meddle with it, for I have not been able to heal anyone of it, nor have I seen another who has achieved this.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you proceed and purge the patient of black bile sometimes, and then bleed him, if manifest repletion is found.
And then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is positioned for the operation, and then apply to the wound ointments which are suitable for it; and then thoroughly scrape from all sides with a sharp curette until no trace of its roots remains. And let the blood flow, and do not stop it lightly, and press the area, and wipe away the thick blood completely with your hand or with any instrument that is available to you.
But if you encounter excessive bleeding from a vein incision or an artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood ceases, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 44.  (Assuming a chapter numbering system)
On the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy from water, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites, and iron is not applied to the species of tympanites or the species of anasarca, for that is mortal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanitic dropsy with medicine and your treatment is not effective, then consider, for if the patient has already acquired debility, or has another illness along with this dropsy, such as a cough or abdominal pain and similar ailments, then be careful not to treat them with iron, for there is danger in that.
But if you see the patient with exuberant strength, and with no other illness but dropsy alone, and neither a child nor an old person, then the manner of operating on them is that you lift the patient between your hands, and the attendant gently presses their belly with their hand, driving the water towards the area below the pubic bone, and then take a sharp pointed instrument in this manner:
Let it be two-edged, long, with a sharp point like a lancet; however, let there be some shortness in it, little by little, so that in the operation with it you do not penetrate the intestine and injure it.
And then consider if the origin of the dropsy is from the intestines, for then it is necessary that you make the incision at a distance of three fingers from the navel towards the lower parts, directly above the pubic bone.
But if the origin of the dropsy is due to liver disease, then your incision should be three fingers to the left of the navel.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right.
And the incision should not be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, lest the superfluities flow to that weak place.
And then perforate the entire sheath with the instrument, and then insert it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the sheath and the peritoneum, and you should scrape that; and if [it's] the amount of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then perforate the peritoneum until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the location of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or bronze or tin, in the lowest part of which is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its incised extremity is shaped like a feather, thus:
And at its uppermost extremity is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately settles on the instrument, therefore evacuating the water in a moderate amount, for if you evacuate more than is necessary at that time, the patient quickly dies from the dissolution of his animal spirit, or a syncope occurs which is close to death.
But evacuate according to the strength of the patient and according to what the patient's condition, pulse strength, and overall well-being indicate to you.
And then extract the instrument, and retain the water, the reason being that it is immediately retained by the sheath which covers the hole that is above the cup, which I have told you to perforate in that manner.
And then repeat the procedure with the instrument on the following day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for a few days cautiously, and beware of error so that little water remains.
But if you fear for the patient, and leave a large quantity of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and induce sweating in a bath, and expose him to the sun for a long time; and treat him with desiccative medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, the spleen, and the liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.
Chapter 55.
Of the treatment of children who are born with imperforate urinary tracts.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the head of its penis is not perforated (or the opening is narrow or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with perforation as soon as it is born, using a very fine instrument, according to this method:
Then place a thin lead pin in the opening and leave it there for three or four days.
And when he wants to urinate, it should be moved and he will urinate; then return it to its place.
And if you do not place the lead [pin], it is possible that the urine, which goes to that place, will not allow it to close.
But that [opening] whose hole is narrow should be treated with a lead pin, as we have said, for several days until it is widened.
But in those in whom the opening is not in its place, it is said that the cause is that for those who are born, the opening is below the end of the penis, so that they cannot urinate unless they lift the penis with their hand upwards. And it is not generative for them because the sperm cannot reach the mother in a straight line, and it is a very prolonged illness.
And the manner of the operation on him is that the patient should be placed on his back, and then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with vehement traction, and incise the head of the penis at the location of the foreskin with a sharp scalpel, like a feather incision, or that you shave some part, so that the middle of it becomes similar to the head of the penis and that the opening falls in the middle place as it should be.
And beware of the flow of blood in your operation, for this often happens; and stop the bleeding, and care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Concerning the albater which occurs in the prepuce at the head of the penis, and of corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis.
Often this albater occurs on the penis and is a swelling of fleshy matter.
And of these, one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
For the non-malignant, you should suspend it with a fine thread and cut it off until you cleanse it entirely; then apply to that wound something dipped in Egyptian ointment; and after that, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the albater is malignant, of a dark color, then you should apply cautery near its incision and its root.
But if the albater is in the prepuce of the head of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the albater is inside the prepuce and the other part is outside, then you should remove the albater which is inside first until it is consolidated; and then you treat the outside part, because if you treat them together, the prepuce may be damaged.
And if you see in the genitals and prepuce blackness and corruption, then you should remove all that which is already blackened and which is starting to corrupt or which is already corrupt; and then apply to that place honey, which is mixed with finely ground pomegranate rind flour and crushed and sifted herbs.
And then treat it with the other cure until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply lunar cautery according to this method:
Because cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, that is, for the flow of blood and for the wound when it is corrupt.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you must insert a lead cannula into the meatus of the prepuce so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis (and this adhesion does not occur except in one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess), it is necessary that you scrape with a blunt spatula until the bond is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate these exquisitely, then it is necessary that you scrape with a spatula some part of the head of the penis and of the prepuce, and this is because the prepuce, when it is thin, is very easily perforated by its slight thinness.
Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then let it be treated with styptic wine until it is consolidated (healed).
Chapter 57.
Of the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to those of circumcision.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is of our operation and our will, and since it is properly done on infants, it is necessary that we assign to it the best operation and the easiest method leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not discuss circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience.  The reason is that I have found most artisans and barbers use circumcision and cleansing with a lancet and with forceps; and they use ligation with thread and incision with the nail.
And I have tried all these methods and I find no better cleansing with forceps, with ligation with thread, than cleansing with the nail, because many times the upper skin escapes, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is easily forced to another incision and certain pain. And with cleansing which is done with a scalpel, and is digital, which shoemakers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not ensured, because it easily enters the hole of it.
But in the operation with a nail, it easily becomes rusty and corrupts your operation. And the foreskin of a child is short by nature, and many times it is born in such a way that it has no need of cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with forceps and ligatures with thread, the goodness, experience has shown me, because the forceps are of proportional incision, for that reason because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below; and therefore when you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportioned, and you incise according to a comparison at one time; and a compression of the thread is made with a shape containing the foreskin of the penis from all sides, with which no error occurs at all.
And the method of the first operation is that you should make the child, especially if it is one of those who understand a little, stay still, so that you only tie the thread on its penis, and leave it there until the next day.
And then do that in every way possible, according to what it can understand. And then hold the child steadily between your hands, and let it not be moving around; and hide the forceps in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them or any other instruments.
And then place your hand on his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it back until the head of the penis is exposed, and then cleanse it of any dirt that is attached to it.
The shape of the forceps for circumcision, this is the shape:
Let some of the extremities be non-cutting and the others be cutting, so that the claw's branch does not protrude, and let the length of the two points be equal to the length of two handles equally.
But the error in circumcision is that you very easily remove the entire inner foreskin, or part of it, below the incision.
Therefore it is necessary that you extend that of your hour with your fingernail before the suppuration of the place and that you incise it according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then extract it with tweezers and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and what is swollen remains under the suppurating penis, then you leave it until the hot abscess subsides, and gently scrape it, and incise it as you see fit.
And guard the head of the penis, for that will not harm him.
And then cure it with that which consolidates the wound, from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised beyond measure from the scrotum, and it obeys the upper parts, that does not harm him.
And moreover, cure it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Concerning the cure of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from a stone, or by congealed blood, or by pus, or by flesh, and similar to those [causes]; concerning the methods of cure, see the division [of this text, presumably a previous chapter].
And if it is not dissolved by what we have said and the cause is vehement in the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver and let it be subtly long and hollow, like a bird's quill, with a thin long shaft about a palm and a half long, which has a thin tube in its head.
And the manner of drawing the urine with this is that you take a folded cloth and tie wool or cotton to its end with a good binding; and insert the ends of the cloth into the part below the syringe, and cut with scissors if there is any superfluous wool, but insert it into the tube forcefully. Then lubricate the syringe with butter and egg white.
And make the patient sit on a chair, and rub his bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and rose water.
Then gently insert the syringe until it reaches the root of the penis; then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; then push the syringe inside that; and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient know that it has reached the empty cavity, and that this is not done according to this order, but the meatus, in which it goes tortuously.
Then slowly extend the cloth with the wool, because the urine will soak the wool.
Then remove it and perform a urine cure, and use a syringe, do not cease doing this and use a syringe until the bladder is evacuated and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Concerning the quality of bladder irrigation with a catheter and with similar instruments which are suitable for this.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or congealed blood within it, or putrefaction is constricted there, and you wish to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument which is called a catheter, and this is its form:
but at its extremity it is blunt, that is, closed. And in it are three holes: two on one side, thus far.
In the beginning is a concave place, in which is that which is pushed, and let it be according to the quantity that fills that, without addition, until when any cause is drawn from the humidities by it, is drawn, and when it is expelled, by this it should be drawn, and when it is expelled long, as the catheter does with which naphtha is poured in sea battles.
Therefore, when you wish to draw out the humidities in the bladder, insert the extremity of the catheter into the humidity, and draw with it that which is pushed to the upper parts, because the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the catheter.
And then insert the tip of the catheter into the urethra as we have recounted in the syringe; and then expel the humidity with that which you expel, for that humidity immediately reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that.
Form of the fine catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is the form:
And let it be made of silver or tin, of which the highest end should resemble a small feather, and below it a smooth canal.
And then take a goat's bladder, and place in it the humidity that you wish to inject into the bladder, and then tie it between two [points] with a strong ligature with a double thread, and heat that humidity over the fire.
And then insert the tip of the catheter into the penis (or urethra).
And then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid with gentle pressure until the patient says that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and perforate it throughout its circumference; and then insert strong thread into those holes, in such a way that it is interwoven; and then attach the circle such that it is firmly attached, so that you place in it what you want of the humidities, and oils and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with that as you have done with the bladder, and express with your hand until the humidity reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of a stone.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stone and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and a stone generated in the bladder, and the signs of it.
And we have mentioned the stone in which [one performs] an operation with the hand, and incision.
And the stone generated in the bladder properly is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating that with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that the stone generated in the bladder mostly affects children; and among its signs is that the urine that is expelled from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his genitals, and often cries, and is restless; and with this, pus comes out of the anus in many of them.
And the healing of children from this is easier until they have reached fourteen years; and it is difficult to cure in the elderly. But in young people it is moderate because it is between those [extremes -  referring to easier healing in children and difficult healing in the elderly].
And of that [patient] in whom the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is contrary to that [i.e., the cure is harder].
Therefore, to arrive at the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning that we purify the patient with a clyster which removes all the waste that is in his bowels; for this waste sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone through its examination.
And then let the patient be taken with his feet up and be massaged and manipulated downwards so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it sometimes jumps out of its place.
And then make that [patient] sit between your hands, prepared, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder is made to incline downwards.
And then search for it [the stone] and all of it externally.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you should immediately attend to it with an incision.
And if it does not entirely fall down under your touch, then it is necessary that you anoint with oil your index finger of your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if he is a fully grown youth, and insert it into his anus. And search for the stone until it is under your finger. And bring it back little by little to the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards to the place where you made the incision.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with her hand; and command another assistant that with her right hand she extend the genitals upwards, and with her other hand she hold back the perineum which is below the genitals, near the place where the incision is made.
Then introduce a well-sharpened spatula, of which this is the form: and incise that which is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let a transverse incision be made, so that the external incision is wide and the internal narrow according to the size that the extraction of the stone allows, and no larger, for you will easily compress with your finger which is in the anus the stone through the incision, and it will be expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones are angular and jagged, which makes their extraction difficult.
And those which resemble acorns, and are round, are easily extracted.
Therefore, if it is one which is angular and jagged, adjust it in the fissure (or incision).
And if it is not thus expelled, then you must press on it, or grasp it with a suitable instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you grasp the stone, and do not let go of it; or introduce a slender instrument with a curved end below it.
But if you cannot grasp it, then widen the opening a little, and if you see a flow of blood, staunch it with crushed vitriol.
But if there is more than one stone, then initially place your hand on the opening of the bladder, and then incise above it; and then press gently; and similarly proceed if there are several more than two.
And if the stone is very large, it is unwise to incise it with a large cut, for this will cause one of two things to the patient: either death, or continuous urinary incontinence, because the area is not completely consolidated (healed).
But administer its expulsion until it is removed, or work on breaking it up with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Then, when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it tightly. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be calmed.
Then lay the patient supine on his back, and do not unbind the bandage until the third day.
And when you have unbound it, wash the area with water and plenty of oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound there appears a hot, burning, corrosive abscess, similar to blood frozen in the bladder, and because of it urine is prevented (and this is known by the passage of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it will cause bladder corruption and putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and apply, according to its nature, whatever is suitable for its healing until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the entire treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the meatus of the penis, and is lodged there, and the flow of urine is obstructed, then treat it with what I recommended before resorting to incision, because many times for this treatment one is accused of incision; and I have proven this, and it is that you take a heated iron perforator, of which this is the form:
of triangular extremity, sharp, set in wood.
And then take bile, and bind with it the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, perforating easily until the perforator reaches that stone. And rotate the perforator with your hand on that stone little by little, and you will enlarge the perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side; for the urine is immediately released.
And then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outer part of the penis, because that is fragmented, and it is expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not suitable for you for any reason that prohibits it, then tie one bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. And then make an incision on the stone in that penis between the two bandages. And then extract it. And then untie the bandages and clean the congealed blood which is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to have a bandage below the stone, except so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other bandage above is also there because, when the bandage is untied near the extraction of the stone, the stone returns to its place and closes the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the bandage above, that you raise the stone to the upper parts, or that it return after your completion, and the wound closes as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of a stone from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
But if a stone is found in any of them, then its cure is difficult, and is forbidden in many ways.
One reason is that a woman is very easily made a virgin again.
And the second is that you will not find a woman, whether chaste or married, who willingly reveals herself to the physician.
The third is that you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation by hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision for a stone in women is far from the location of the stone itself, therefore requiring a deep incision, and in that there is danger.
But if necessity compels you to this, then it is necessary that you take a female physician who is well-skilled, and such are rarely found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a clever and subtle physician, or present a matron well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who knows some part of this art.
Therefore, have that woman present, and command her to do everything you order, from the initial examination for the stone; the reason being that if she observes whether the woman is a virgin, then she must put her finger in her rectum and search for the stone.
Then, if she finds it, carefully place her finger there, and then command her to incise it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder, and compress it with good compression.
Then, if she finds it, she must gently wash it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with a decoction of its virtue until it reaches the root of the thing.
And then incise it near the midpoint of the vagina, below the root of the thing, wherever it is stopped, and cut the stone in that area, and her finger should not be removed from the stone while cutting below it.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert a probe into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then adjust the incision according to the size that you know the stone will be expelled from it.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and smooth and rough, and long and round, and having branches.
Therefore you should know how many types there are of them so that you can signify what you want.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the place and leave it there for an hour until the blood is stopped, and then return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
And make sure you prepare the instruments which are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you may be aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been incised, then place powder on the place and bind it tightly with powders and a descending bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will quickly die. And then take care of the wound.
Then, when the sharpness of the bleeding has subsided after a few days, and the place is healed, then you return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
Chapter 62.
Concerning the incision of a strangulated hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white sheath which is below the tunic of the genitals, containing the testicle, and is called sheath.
And sometimes it is in the proper tunic which nature has prepared for it in the region of the testicle, so that it is believed that it is another testicle; and it is the tunic of the genital between the white sheath which we have mentioned, and this is nothing but tartar.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the genitals, so that this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it occurs due to a blow inflicted on the genitals.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or bloody, or reddish, or black and feculent, or white and watery, and this is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is, are these: for if it is in the white sheath which we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, tending slightly towards length, like the shape of an egg, and surrounds the testicle, for the moisture contains it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper tunic, then the abscess is round near the testicle and therefore one believes it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the sheath of the genitals and the white sheath, then it falls below the feeling/sensation.
And as you want to know the color of the moisture, then you examine the color of the moisture in the abscess with a lancet, the form of which precedes; and according to what has emerged in the trace of the lancet, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we come to its treatment with iron, then it is necessary that we order the patient to be phlebotomized if that is possible for you, and you see his body full.
And then let him be supine on his back on something a little raised, and place many cloths under him.
And then sit you on his left side, and order the assistant to follow on his right side, who shall extend his finger to one of two sides, to the sheath of the genitals and to the part of the navel of the belly.
And then take a broad spatula and split the sheath of the genitals in the middle lengthwise almost to the pubic bone.
And let the incision be made straight and equally distant from the line that divides the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the included white tunic.
And scrape that, and observe, and beware that you do not incise that; and your scraping with which you scrape it, let it be suspended, however, with the utmost care and subtlety, scraping according to the quantity possible for you.
And then perforate the water-filled tunic with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the tunic to the upper parts; and do not touch the sheath of the genitals that it encloses, and incise the tunic in whatever way is possible for you. And incise it in its entirety or in pieces, and especially its thin layer, for if you do not meticulously examine its incision, there is no certainty that the water will not return.
But if the egg protrudes from its sheath during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the tunic, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the sheath of the genitals with a suture, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the egg corrupted by another illness, then you should tie the vessels which are on the suspensory ligament, and extract the egg, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the water is collected in two parts together, then know that there are two hernias; therefore incise that part as you have done in the other equally; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then you do it.
And then you wipe away the blood, and introduce into the incisions wool submerged in oil or rose oil; and place outside other wool which you have submerged in wine and oil, and spread this over the genitals and the pubic area; and place over it folded cloths and powders, and bind these on top with a bandage which is according to this form:
And then let two cloths be taken and filled with carded wool in this manner; and let the ends be made with which it is bound of cotton or wet wool, and let them be attached with a ligature in the waistband of the trousers, and one of the ends should go from the buttocks inwards to the front, and the second should go to the groin area, and two ends over the two thighs and two other ends over the two knees, and the whole ligature should be fastened in the waistband of the trousers.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with an iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery and that you incise with it the skin of the genitals, and it is heated as we have recounted until the white cyst containing the water is discovered, and then you take a cautery of this form: and it is similar to the Greek letter.
And then pierce the cyst with it, and heat it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then stretch the cyst with tweezers, and scrape with tweezers, and scrape with a thin, heated cautery; and incise it as much as you can until you eradicate all of it; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg.
And know that this operation is safer and less prone to blood loss, and better than operation with incision.
But if an abscess develops contrary to expectation during the incision or cauterization, or there is bleeding, then you must cure whatever is opposing you because of this, with the treatment which is appropriate for it, as stated.
But if the patient is fearful and does not expect a second operation because of its unpleasantness, then administer a perforation as I recommend here; and this is when you are certain, from what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is watery.
Then you should make the patient sit on some elevated seat, then pierce the abscess in its lowest part with a wide spatula, and make the perforation according to the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough so that all the water flows out.
And then place a cotton cloth over the area and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water drains. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the outflow of water at that time, you should perforate it: and this is done only because the white panniculus in the orifice of the wound creates resistance and prevents the exit of the water, then you should put into the wound a tool with which water is extracted from dropsies, the form of which has been previously described; or apply a small incision to the wound.
And know that the water returns, and it is collected again after about six months or thereabouts; and when it is collected, then it should be perforated in the same manner, for the patient will thus pass their days.
Chapter 63.
Concerning the incision of a fleshy hernia and its cure.
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is a danger leading to death in the most favorable conditions; therefore, in my view, its removal and being saved by that [method] is better.
And I am remembering the operation in that [hernia] and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses originate in the genitals which are comprised of tissues and this is caused by many things: either by an acute, acrid superfluity which is poured into the genitals, or by a blow.
And the color of the abscess follows the color of the body, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And very quickly it is a calcified abscess, of which the color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by a knotting of the arteries, and by an inflammation of them as it is perceived in the memory of it, or by an inflammation of the veins.
But that which is from inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when we compress it with our fingers; and it should not be touched.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any means through compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision is made on this area and on the other flesh; and it is that you incise the skin of the genitals, and then extend the testicle upwards, and extract it from the white tunic, and free the suspensory ligament, and ligate it, and incise the suspensory ligament so that you free it from all parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already consolidated with those inflamed tissues, then you must extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between any part of the tunic, or between that which is between the vessels, then you must free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh at the site of the adhesion which is behind, then you must incise all that which is there, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Then, when your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Concerning the treatment of a hernia that is of the intestine.
A vitelline abscess is an inflammation enveloped by some membrane similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles, and causes difficulty with exercise and walking for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, it is necessary to fear that which precedes it. (or:  And in the treatment of this illness, fear is due to the condition that precedes it.)
However, it is necessary that we describe the operation in that case, as the first physicians did.
And I say that you must have the patient sit on a raised seat; and then gently pull the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards; and then hold the scrotum with your fingers and with the vessels that are proved to be in the vein; and have another assistant hold those, and extend them with strong extension.
And then incise with a sharp, broad scalpel with a transverse incision directly over the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then scrape away all the area as we have told you in the extraction of arrowheads which are in the temples.
And then insert a needle with double thread into those, and tie it in the first of the places where you incised, and tie it again in the back of them. And then incise those in the middle place with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the fetid and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which you wish healing to be engendered, so that the vessels which nourish one of the two genitals may fall, for that is not harmful.
But if you incise all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be tied off with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they atrophy, or that they be tied off so that there is no nourishment to them.
Chapter 65.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture that happens in the peritoneum extended over the abdomen, from the inguinal region of the abdominal wall, causing the intestines to protrude from that rupture.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or an extension of it, and these two types occur for many reasons:  impact, jumping, shouting, lifting something heavy, or similar.
And the sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, is that it happens gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and it is an inguinal abscess near the pubis because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum, is that at the beginning it causes sudden, severe pain; and it is a different kind of abscess appearing below the pubic bone, and this is because of the protrusion of the intestine, and its body outside the parts of the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum is expelled along with the intestine, and this hernia is called an intestinal zirbal hernia.  (Note: "zirbal" appears to be a variant or perhaps a misspelling of a term related to the omentum's involvement.)
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and it is retained there, and this is a great danger for the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of this type of illness with iron (cautery) there is danger, therefore the cauterization should be avoided in this case.
And the manner of operating on it is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand to its cavity if it obeys its return, and then it should be pressed on its neck between your hands, and raise his legs.
And then hold the cord which is the spermatic cord above the scrotum, and incise the spermatic cord lengthwise; and then place hooks in the two lips of the incision, as you need to keep the incision open with them.
And if the incision, as much as you can, allows the stone to be expelled.
And then scrape away the skin which is under the spermatic cord, until the hard white tunic is exposed on each side.
Then you insert your finger into what is the testicle, into that which is between the white tunic, which is under the spermatic cord, and between the second tunic, and break up with it the adhesion that is on the back part of the testicle.
And then gently hold the spermatic cord from the outside with your hand, and with this extend the white tunic upwards with your left hand, and elevate the testicle with the tunic to the edge of the incision; and tell the assistant to hold the testicle upwards while you dissolve the adhesion behind with complete resolution.
And search with your fingers that there is no bowel enveloped in the hard white tunic. But if you find any such thing, then you push it back down into the abdomen.
And then make an incision in the area below the spermatic cord, through which section blood and pus will flow, as we have recounted in what we have said.
And then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature which we have described (and sometimes the white tunic is cauterized, which we mentioned to prevent bleeding at the incision, because this often happens) and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be bathed with warm water, and keep that on it until it falls off as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other treatment for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Concerning a ventosity hernia (or, more accurately, a cystic swelling/hernia).
In this hernia, I have not seen anyone who has dared to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done in the same way as we have recounted in the hernia that is with pus; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision on that with gentleness; and then dry the area around the abscess with something that opens it, until the vessels collapse.
And cure the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the disruption that is made in the inguinal region.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and it swells the area.
And do not allow the genitals to cause any displacement of the intestines to the genitals; and if they do, it is little; and it returns in all hours.  (A more modern interpretation: And don't let the genitals be a cause of the intestines being displaced into the genital area; if this happens, it's a minor issue, and it will return to its place repeatedly.)
But if the time with this is prolonged, a fissure is made in the inguinal canal until the intestine descends into the inguinal canal; and this happens because of the extension of the inguinal canal which is in the groin as we have said, the cause of which is that the inguinal canal is stretched, and then it is softened and the place is abscessed and swollen.
And its cure is with cautery, as the narration of it has preceded. (Meaning: And the treatment is cauterization, as described previously.)
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this manner: and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry the place of the rupture of the swollen abscesses with a cut across the width according to the amount of three fingers. (Meaning:  Sometimes it is cured with a surgical tool (iron), in the following way: The patient lies supine between your hands, and then the swollen, ruptured area is dried with a three-finger-wide incision.)
And then tighten the white inguinal canal that is under the groin until it is uncovered/exposed. (Meaning: And then constrict the inguinal canal beneath the groin until it is visible.)
And then take the ray (likely referring to a surgical instrument, possibly a cautery) and place it on the prominent place of the inguinal canal, and press it towards the front of the belly.
And then sew the two prominent places on the end of the inguinal canal's ray, and join one to the other with a suture. (Meaning: And then stitch together the two prominent areas at the end of the inguinal canal using a suture.)
And then extract the end of the ray (instrument), and do not incise the inguinal canal completely, nor extend the wound, nor any other thing as I will let you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia. (Meaning:  Then remove the instrument; do not completely cut the inguinal canal, nor enlarge the wound, nor do anything else as I will explain in treating intestinal hernias.)
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and as you would incising the intestines, clean it and restore the wound until it is healed; because the inguinal canal is constricted and the prominence of the rupture is not aligned/reduced. (Meaning: Treat this like any other wound, and as you would when treating an intestinal incision; cleanse and repair it until healed, because the inguinal canal is tight and the hernia is not properly reduced).
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health/healing. (Meaning: Cauterization is preferable here, as it promotes healing.)
Chapter 68.
Concerning the softening of the swelling of the testicles.
Many times the swelling of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh that is between them is softened, and its appearance is foul. (Meaning:  Often, testicular swelling softens because the tissue between the testicles softens, and the appearance is unsightly/infected.)
Then it is necessary for the one who is charged with his cure to make the patient lie on his back, and incise all the swelling which is softened above the natural swelling; and then that he join the two lips with suture. (Meaning: The physician must position the patient supine, incise the softened area of swelling, and then suture the wound.)
And if you wish, sew up in the beginning the superfluity of the softened swelling with three or four stitches and with firm suture. (Meaning: Optionally, begin by removing excess softened tissue with 3-4 strong sutures.)
And then incise between the sutures; and then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall out. (Meaning:  Incise between the sutures, and then treat the wound as other wounds until healed and the stitches can be removed.)
Chapter 69.
On castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, but because of that it is read to me that I remember it in this book; and its remembrance is not necessary except in two ways, of which one is so that this is in the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it, that he may know the treatment of that to which it happens; and the other way is that many times we have need of the castration of other animals for our benefit from them, such as of sheep, and of goats, and of pigs, and of similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by abrasion, or by incision.
But in that which is done by abrasion, the way of the operation is that we cause the animal to be bathed in warm water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. Then grasp them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear below the touch.
But in castration done by incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the scrotum of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament, and incise over each testicle with a cut until the two testicles are exposed.
Then incise those [testicles] after you have flayed each one. And do not place any kind of bandage on them except a fine bandage which is placed over the vessels.
And this manner of castration is better which is done by crushing, because strong crushing leaves no part of the testicles behind, so that the animal desires no more mating.
Then care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Concerning the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is according to two manners: one is when there appears in that which should be the space of the testicles, between the two testicles, a female-like structure, in which there is hair.
And sometimes from that structure urine flows, which is in the area of the testicles.
But in women it is a single type: it is that the vulva, above the mons pubis, is like two testicles of a man, somewhat smaller, externally shaped like a man's prepuce and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you incise those constricted tissues until the compression is released, and then treat them with the treatment for other wounds.
And in the second type in men, from which urine flows which is in the area of the testicles, there is no treatment or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Concerning swelling and prominent flesh due to causes in women.
A slight swelling is constricted due to natural causes until it is pressed and made light by observation; and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it is spread as in men and extends to intercourse.
Then it is necessary that you hold the excess swelling with your hand or with a bandage and cut it.
And do not overdo the incision, especially near the root, so that a flow of blood does not result.
And then cure it with the treatment for wounds until it is healed.
Moreover, a fleshy growth is flesh that grows in the mother's womb until it fills it, and quickly emerges externally resembling a tail (and because of this, some initially call this "tailed disease"); therefore, we must incise it as we incise a swelling, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of sciatica.
Sciatica is when the woman's vagina is not perforated, or the opening is small. And this is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a preceding illness, and that is caused either by insufficiently formed flesh or by a subtle or thick scar.
And it is formed either in the front of the mother, or on her sides, or in her upper part, or in her lower part, and it prohibits coitus, conception, and childbirth, and very quickly it prohibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by observing the womb; if the obstruction is apparent, it is close; but if it is not apparent, then you seek it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin scar, and is close to the two labia, then you incise and break it up.
And it is that you place powders on the two labia, and then place your index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then spread the two labia forcefully until that thin scar is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the area, and keep it moist throughout the day so that the incised area does not consolidate (heal too quickly).
But if the scar is thick and coarse, then you must incise it with a broad spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to proud flesh (exuberant granulation tissue), then suspend it with an uncia (a unit of weight, implying a weight to apply tension), and incise it.
And have with you the medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting (i.e., cauterization), such as acacia, dragon's blood, and incense, mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not close up too quickly.
And keep it there for some days and apply some dry poultice.
And then it should be treated with the other healing methods until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the birth of other growths, and then it is necessary to incise in this manner. But if this is due to a hard abscess, the hard abscess which is in the mother should not be treated with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids and fistulas and red swellings that occur in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the openings of many veins from which much blood continuously flows; and when hemorrhoids are old, fistulas are formed.
And already I have mentioned in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will say thus which ones receive a cure and which ones do not receive a cure.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and fistulas, when they are in the womb of the mother and do not appear externally, then in those cases no treatment should be done with iron (i.e., cautery or surgical instruments).
But those which are at the orifice of the womb, upon which one feels (them), are those that are cured (treatable).
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cool place and then extend the fistula with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them at the roots.
And then sprinkle on those (wounds) to stem the flow of blood one of the incisive powders without biting (i.e., causing further irritation), such as acacia and similar things.
And then bathe her feet for an hour, and then place her in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and weld and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with this and apply it to her back.
And if the blood is stopped, it is good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, to the breasts without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or in houseleek juice or in rue juice with old wine and apply it to the place; and then treat the place with ointment until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of a fistula, an accident in the mother.
Many types of abscesses happen in the mother, such as cancer, and stone abscess, and ulcerations, and buboes, and herpes, and hemorrhoidal fistulas, and fissures, and boils, and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these illnesses, their types, their signs, and their cures in the divisions (chapters/sections).
And it is necessary that I speak in this treatise of a hot abscess which comes in the mother (pregnant woman) when it is among the abscesses which collect pus, and if you wish to know in what manner the operation on it is done with iron (a cautery).
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with throbbing and phlegm and fever, and sometimes it reddens and if it affects the feeling (sensation), then do not treat it with perforation, and cure it with that which helps with maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
And then you must make the woman sit on a stool that has two supports; and she reclines on her side and adjusts her feet to the part just below the belly, and her thighs should be spread, and she places her arms below her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage.
And then the midwife follows from the right side and provides the instrument with which the opening of the mother (the birth canal) is opened, the form of which will come in those matters that are done next.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument that you place with the ray (likely referring to a light source or visual guidance) the cervix of the woman's womb, and that which of the instrument enters the womb should not be more than the cervix of the womb and harms the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the cervix of the womb, then it is necessary that you place powders on the texture of the cervix of the womb so that the entry of any instrument into the cervix of the womb is prevented.
And it is necessary that you place the vertigine (likely a turning or twisting motion) which runs in the instrument from the upper side and that the attendant holds the instrument and revolves the vertigine until the opening of the mother (birth canal) is opened.
And when the incision appears, and is touched with the hand and is soft and moist, then it is necessary that you dry that area with a clean cloth. (The Latin "spatum" seems to have been interpreted as a type of cloth.)
And when the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a wick submerged in rose oil or green oil in which there is some stypticity; and place the compress on the section in the cervix of the womb.
And place outside the womb and on the vulva clean wool submerged in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then it should be cured in about two days with an ointment which is suitable for this, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed in such a way that it is rinsed with water and honey, and then with water in which the root of lily or of birthwort has been boiled, and then returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep inside the concealed womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, taking care of it with what we have said in the division (chapter/section).
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives in what manner living embryos should be treated when they exit in a non-natural way (i.e., miscarriage or premature birth).
It is necessary that the midwife know at the beginning the form of natural childbirth by its signs, and it is that when you see the woman strain in the lower parts and desire to smell the air, and furthermore is lightened by what is upon her of the birth, and hastens the exit of the embryo, then you know that this birth is according to the natural form, and it is the exit of the child head first, and the afterbirth with it or suspended from or hanging from the umbilicus.
Therefore, when you see those signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends easily because when they descend head first, the afterbirth descends with them, and is cleansed of those superfluities with good cleansing.
But that which is other than this birth is unnatural and unfavorable, for when the embryo is expelled feet first and its body is expelled before its head and feet, and one of its hands, or its foot, or its head and hand, or its belly, and very quickly it is turned on its neck, resembling unfavorable presentations.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skillful in all these matters, and to guard herself from error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what skill is needed in them so that it may be signified thereby and be established thereupon.
When the fetus is expelled head first by natural excretion, and this is strenuous for the woman and the birth is difficult, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then have her sit, or have the women support her, and evaporate her genitals with cooked fenugreek and warm oils.
Then the midwife inserts a small, thin spatula between her labia and with it tears the secundines, or scrapes them with her fingernail until the moisture within is removed. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman should be bathed with a poultice of chickpea flour and fenugreek flour with vinegar.
Then, during the bath, instruct her to be compressed and make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, because the fetus will be expelled immediately.
And if both arms of the fetus are expelled first, then you must gently and gradually reduce them. But if it does not obey the treatment, then place the woman on a stool and raise her legs, and then rock the stool gently on the ground; and the woman should be held to prevent her from falling during the rocking.
And if the arms are not returned and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the fetus's remains, or tie its body to its arm with a cloth and extract it gently, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus presents feet first, then you must push them upwards, and gently turn the fetus, and gently grasp it, and gently take one foot and extend it little by little.
But when it has come out between the thighs, then you command her to strain, and make her sneeze forcefully, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recounted, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it in its natural position, for then it will be expelled easily.
And if it is obstructed by all that we have recounted, then take marshmallow root and dissolved gum, and pound it all well in a mortar, and gently apply this to the vulva of the woman, at the lowest part of her belly. And gently make her sit in lukewarm water, up to her hypochondria (the area below the ribs).
And when you see that the lower parts of her are softened, then make a fumigation of myrtle for her and apply it to her. And when she has had the fumigation for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and gently make her sneeze and hold her breath, and lift her up, and press the lower part of her belly with gentle compression, for the fetus will immediately be expelled.
Thus [proceed] with the fetus, holding it laterally with one of your hands. Let [the reduction] be managed with your hand; but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her thighs with a vigorous shaking, and then administer laxatives which I have recommended from mucilages.
And if childbirth has begun, then make her sit on a stool, and then work on the reduction with your hand, and grasp the fetus according to its natural form, and make the woman sneeze and command her to strain until it is expelled.
Thus [manage] the fetus on the neck, spreading your hands, and the surface of it is against the belly of its mother. Let the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and then turn it little by little, and let that be done with ease.
And when it is grasped, then place on the cervix what we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then instruct her to strain little by little, and when you have done that, then make her sit on a stool and instruct her to be inclined on her right side, and then instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze with a concoction [or remedy]. The prepared fetus exits on its side.
When the mother's horror subsides in this manner, consider, and then you incise the secundines with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended over the face and neck, then you incise it at the umbilicus, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then gently push the fetus inwards until you place it as needed, and tell the woman to strain several times, and it will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born, but this is rare and seldom happens; but there are causes for this in nature, and they do not live.
And these, even if they are multiple, share one placenta, and are separated by a membrane, distinguishing them within the umbilical ligament of each one. And sometimes they are expelled as if it were a single fetus by easy natural expulsion, and sometimes they are expelled by difficult expulsion as we have recounted.
And if any of them are difficult to deliver during childbirth and arrive at the state of unnatural presentations we have described, then you should treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and skill, and with patience, and is ingenious according to each presentation as it is prepared for her by her skillful bringing to health.
A recollection of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the mother, and it has been verified by me that one woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten, all formed, which was caused according to the measurements of the glorious wise men (or learned physicians).
And all this must be within the knowledge of the midwife, because it easily appears similar to this, and therefore she should oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat a dead fetus with what we have said in the division on medication and it has not been expelled, and you are forced to use a manual operation, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and is not suffering from any of the accidents which threaten her with loss.
Then the woman should be positioned on the bed on her back, with her head inclined downwards and her thighs elevated.
And the assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
Then you moisten the mother's vulva with humid oils and with mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
Then let the midwife anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and gently insert her hand into the mother, and carefully search with her hand for the location where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus.
And convenient locations for this: therefore you should consider if the fetus is positioned to descend head-first, and then you should grasp the umbilical cord at its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or at its clavicle, or in the appropriate locations near the ribs, or under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is feet-first, then at the heel, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary that you hold the umbilical cord with your right hand, and place its curvature in the space between the fingers of your left hand, and insert your hand gently and place the umbilical cord in any of those locations which we have mentioned, until you reach the empty space [presumably the amniotic sac/vagina].
Then add and place in opposition to it another cord, or a third if necessary, so that the traction is equal, and not solely an extension along its straightness.
Rather, it should be pulled evenly from all sides, so that its extraction is facilitated, just as is done in the extraction of a tooth.
And it is necessary in this that the area between them [presumably the birth canal] be softened; and if any part of it [the baby] is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife lubricate some of her fingers with oil and insert them carefully and loosen what is retained with them.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is expelled, then the cords should be moved to a higher position; and do this until the whole fetus is expelled.
But if one hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then extract it until the whole is expelled, and incise it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus you should proceed with the other hand and the two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or there is constriction in its exit, or there is collected water on its head, then it is necessary to insert a sharpened spatula between the fingers and perforate the head and extract the water, or to break it with an instrument that is called an "alundat," the form of which will come with the forms of other instruments in the chapter which is near this one.
And similarly proceed if the fetus has a naturally large head: and then it is necessary to incise it with a scalpel, or to grasp it with the alundat as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is out but constricted below the clavicle, then it should be incised until the fluid which is in the chest is discharged.
But if it is not complicated, nor does it yield to extraction, then you should incise the head immediately as much as is possible for you.
And if the lower part of the abdomen is abscessed or dropsical, then it is necessary that you perforate it until the fluid that is within it runs out.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction to the mother's birth canal is easy.
But if it is constricted around the abdomen and chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you will have wrapped around your hand, and that you incise the abdomen and chest until that which is within them flows out.
But if the other limbs are obstructed and the head is turned, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's birth canal is open, then she inserts her hand into the womb, and searches with it for the head, and draws it with her fingers towards the mother's birth canal, and then inserts one or two fingers into it, and pulls it with them.
And if the mother's birth canal is constricted by a hot abscess which harms her, then it is necessary that it not be disturbed; rather it is necessary then to administer infusions of humid, oily substances. And administer plasters; and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible, it should be turned: and that which we have said for a living fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then let it be incised in pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave no part of the afterbirth inside.
And when you have completed all your work, then administer that which we have said concerning the treatment of hot abscesses which may occur in the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then bathe in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb was a dead fetus, and soon after that, she became pregnant again, and soon after that, the fetus died again. It happened to him, after a long time, that an abscess formed in his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and it began to discharge pus.
And I was called to his care, and I treated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied plasters of strong attraction to him, and I extracted a bone from him, and after a few days, I extracted another bone; and I was very surprised, since there should be no bones in the belly.
And then I considered that they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I cleansed the wound, and extracted many bones from him, the woman being in good condition, and she lived in this way for a long time,  a small amount of pus still draining from him.
And I did not consider this strange, but because in this there is science and help so that the skillful physician administers a cure with his hand.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
The form of the incision with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a constrictor in which the [uterine] ligaments are grasped, which grasping has two incisions at the two ends of two poles/rods. However, this incision should be finer than the constrictor, and be made either of ivory or of boxwood.
And let the width of each of the said two rods be two fingers, and the thickness of each of the two be one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle space between the two rods are two attachments of the same wood, which are firmly fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb so that it is opened with them when you rotate the two previously described incisions/rods.
Another form similar to that one, but more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of ivory or boxwood, in the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity there are two additions, like branches, and the length of these additions is about a palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you wish to open the womb with them, then make the woman lie on the bed with her legs hanging down, having opened what is between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with scissors, gradually, according to how much you want to open the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
The shape of the instrument with which the fetus is expelled:
The shape of the instrument with which the large head is held back.  (The "2" likely represents a superscript or annotation in the original text, possibly indicating a variant or clarification.)
And it resembles forceps which have teeth at the end, like tongs, and sometimes it is made long like forceps in this shape, like tongs, which have teeth like saw teeth, with which it is incised and held back. The shape of a small instrument:
The shape of a hook having a spine/point.
The shape of a hook having two spines/points.
The shape of a spatula having two ends with which the head is severed/cut.
The shape of two broad spatulas.
All those instruments are exercised, and when the types of those are more multiplied and prepared by the artisans, then it is easier in its operation and more valuable among men because of its quantity/number.
And do not disregard any of those instruments which you may have prepared, for the need for them is not avoidable/inexcusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze forcefully, and press your hand over her mouth and nostrils, and if by this it comes out, it is good.
And if not, then take a pot and pierce a hole in its lid and place herbs inside it, opening the mouth of the mother; herbs such as rue, mint,  anise, chamomile, dried Arabic gum, cassia lignea, and centaury. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the pot, and place that over the fire.
Then place a reed cannula in the mouth of the mother, and hold it there so that the vapor reaches the mother's womb.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if after this treatment it remains and is not expelled, then order the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or mallow poultice, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it; and when it is found, then take it and remove it little by little. But if it is attached to the womb of the mother, then insert her hand as we have recommended, and when she has found the afterbirth, extract it little by little as instructed, so that the mother does not faint from the violent traction. Furthermore, it should be turned to the right and left sides easily.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and herbal oil medication.
But if it is not expelled by all the means we have recommended, then be careful not to tire yourself with repeated attempts at extraction; however, what has come out of her at the mouth of the mother, bind to the woman's vulva, and then cauterize it with ointment and tetrapharmacon; for that will cause it to fester in a few days and it will dissolve and be expelled.
But when it festers, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then fumigations suitable for this should be administered.
But some of the Ancients have already tested fumigation with hellebore and dried figs.
Method for the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and the afterbirth:
Let it be made of glass or brass.
And let the thin end be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation placed on the embers of the fire.
And let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed and then another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus in a child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which are thus narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that stricture with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
And then place on it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then it should be treated with what we have said about the treatment and the lead [likely referring to lead-based ointments].
Concerning the treatment of fistulas that develop below [likely referring to anal fistulas].
The fistulas that develop in the lowest part below are knotty and thick, which develop near the anus externally or in the space of one side [likely referring to the location of the fistula relative to the anus].
And it is one fistula or many.
And when that knot is old and discharges watery white humidity or subtle pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known because of what comes out of them through discharge and by flatulence; and sometimes the patient suffers from discharge, and worms easily come out of them.
And some of these fistulas sometimes penetrate into the space of the bladder, and into the meatus of the penis; and some penetrate into the joint of the hip and into the buttock.
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating into the anus from one that doesn't, is that you insert your finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe of copper or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you don't feel it at all, nor does any matter of discharge, worms, or flatulence proceed from the opening, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then attend to its cure.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meatus of the penis, then its indication is thus: urine from that [area] and prohibition of it so that the place may be consolidated with medicine.
But if it is penetrating into the joint of the hip or into the bone and causes pain in the circumference, then its sign is that the probe penetrates there if there is no tortuosity in it into the bone, and causes pain in the circumference of the part; and that from it comes putridity constantly; and that medication is of no use in it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure, and the cure of these is the labor and vanity of foolish physicians, upon which they are fixed.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for, according to what I will relate to you, and this I have already proven.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back and raises his legs upward, his thighs inclined towards his belly, and then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe penetrates.
And if the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel with your finger the probe already discovered by itself penetrating, other than what you feel between your finger and that abscess or flesh, then you know for certain that this is penetrating; and then do not work on that, for there is no healing in that, as we have said.
However, some say that it is healed slowly in some men.
And the medication by which improvement is hoped for is that you ignite a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been described, and insert that ignited cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those fleshy fistula-like growths resembling a bird's quill are cauterized.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen until all the cauterized flesh sloughs away, and then treat it with flesh-generating and consolidating medicines, and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, and does not penetrate beyond your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a palpable thickness of flesh or abscess, and you see the fistula in such a way that it is the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it dry with the probe, and let it be in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the end of the probe arrives, and through the probe it is freed and removed.
And then cleanse those fistula-like tissues which resemble a bird's quill, and let no part of them remain.
But if you see a flow of blood occur between you and your work when you cauterize those tissues, then the best and most gentle instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire accomplishes two good things: that is, the cauterization of those affected tissues, and the staunching of the blood and the drying of the humors.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen or crushed flax until the area produces pus, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate firm flesh.
And these are medicines in which there is astringency and drying; when that is restored it is healed and we do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula penetrates to the rectum and extends from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and explore it with that.
And so if you feel the fistula and between you and it there is a membrane of fat or flesh, and it is suitable for penetration, then there is no operation on it except by way of trust and hope.
Which cause is to be managed in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or dry it until you reach its cavity so that it is possible for you to insert the poultices and the appropriate cure; and do not proceed much with incision lest you cut the muscle containing the rectum, and that you harm the patient in such a way without their will; and then treat it with what we have said for it will heal quickly; or that you elongate that membrane and clean it after drying it near the rectum, as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp extremity, and then clean those fistulous tissues which are in the incision where you can with probing; and then strive to effect the healing of the whole wound with incision, and if the orifice above is not healed, and the fistula remains open in the part of the rectum, and will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this manner: it is when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the side of the rectum around the surface of the body with the tail and in the margin of the rectum, then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle for preparing skins in this form:
and insert it into that fistula wrapped with five threads or around them; and then insert a probe with thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it is penetrating into the margin of the rectum inwards, then you extract the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the rectum; and extract the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each, and leave it for a day or two, and when you incise the thread further into the flesh, tighten it well so that those tissues are incised which are between the two ends of the thread and that they fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and consolidated.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, however you are prepared to do so, except that it should be very carefully done, because it is not for you to do this so as not to cut the muscle; and then treat it with that until it is healed.
The form of the pointed probe with which the fistula is probed: its curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not incise what is not necessary, as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows in their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, for either they are between the buttocks like charcoal, or they are like bunches of grapes. And of these there are small and large ones, and blood flows from them constantly, and there is one, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the months of little humidity, from which flows citrine water or a little blood with continuous discharge, and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you command the patient to sit and strain until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you should grasp and lift them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, and then incise them down to their roots.
But if the hooks cannot hold them because of their humidity and softness, then grasp them with a rough cloth or with cotton or with a wad of wool, and extract them with your fingers, and then incise them and sprinkle on them some hot powders near the incision, so that they act on them in place of cautery; or cauterize them as is described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatments until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey [the command to] protrude, then stimulate the patient with a small, mildly irritating suppository, and it should be washed with that water which is in the anus and which should gently protrude when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and you should grasp them with your fingernail, or grasp them with a hook, and incise them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And that which you have incised, you must suture as follows: take enveloped thread and insert it into a needle and then extract the hemorrhoids to the upper parts, and make it penetrate with the needle to the root on the other side, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and it should be latitudinally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong suture, and then knot the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all, and leave one of them uncut, so that the superfluity of blood may flow from it.
And then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate; and place that upon the anus and command the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat it with ointment or other treatment until it is healed.
And since they are old and that medicine is not effective, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are moist and the outer layer is removed from them, which prevents their consolidation; and then treat them until they are consolidated.
Then remove them with a more forceful scraping than the first, until they bleed much and are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that a felon, that is, a whitlow, is nothing but a red nodule, according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail, and is found throughout the body and especially in the parts below the feet and on the fingers, and pain arises from them because of the inflammation.
And then it is necessary that what is in the circumference of the whitlow be incised, and held with forceps or with an instrument, and be eradicated from its root; and then treat it.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been described in its chapter.
Moreover, a wart is a small, rough, fistulated, round eminence on the surface of the body, and many times it appears on the hands of children.
And its cure is that you extend and incise it, or that you constrict it with a thread or with a tight bandage so that it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine (caustic).
Moreover, a mole is a small, hairy or fistulated, large eminence on the surface of the body, going far into the skin, and when the cold finds it, it is felt in it similar to the biting of an ant, and it is found all over the body.
And its cure is that you take a cannula of goose quill or vulture quill, and it should be strong, and place it over the mole until the circle of the cannula contains the parts of it; and then rotate your hand with the cannula until you incise what is in the circumference of the mole, and place it into the depth of the flesh, and so you eradicate the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a brass or iron cannula according to this method:
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn out to a fine point, blunt (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that the burning of it is prevented and its rotation (is facilitated).
And if you wish, cauterize the mole as was previously mentioned in the cauterization of a boil in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the instruments that are used to administer a clyster.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or latten (brass), or cast or hammered bronze; and sometimes it is made of these instruments, small and large, according to those to whom they are administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose bowels are weak or painful, the clysters for them should be small.
The form of a large and a small clyster:
The head of its cannula, to which the bag is attached, should be wide in this manner; and let there be a distinction where the bag is tied, like this.
And the lower extremity, which is inserted into the rectum, should be blunt (that is, not open), very smooth, tapering to a point; and on one side of it let there be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the fingers and a little larger.
And let the bag, in which the medicines are placed, be of animal bladder or sheepskin, and its length be one palm (handspan).
And let it be perforated with many holes, thus arranged; and let the space between the holes be the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong, raw flax threads, about ten or so; and attach the bag with them; and when the bag is placed in position, tie it tightly at the head of the clyster with two distinct ligatures, and then cauterize each hole with it.  The method of cauterizing this is that you fill the bag with the medicine, warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then let the patient lie supine on his back, and raise his legs and place a cushion beneath him, upon which is already placed a cloth or linen; and then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or something similar; and then insert it into the rectum easily, and then let the attendant take the bag and squeeze it with both hands and vigorously until everything in the clyster is evacuated into the bowel; and then withdraw the clyster and the patient lowers his legs.
And if the medicine forces him to defecate, hold it as long as you can; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial in its effect.
But if you administer this clyster for diseases of diarrhea and his defecation is frequent, then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the rectum, then the clyster should be very fine and soft, of the kind with which infants are clystered.
Concerning the cure of wounds.
I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds what was appropriate to the subject, and I say thus the treatment of those with hand and with medicines according to their needs.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what causes the wounds and according to the location where the wounds occur.
And the causes by which wounds are often made are such as a fall from a height, or an incision by a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or with a stick, or with an arrow, or similar things from many causes.
But the wounds that are in the locations of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the abdomen, or the thigh, and similar to those of the limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of certain wounds so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, for the discussion of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from a fall from a height or similar, and it has only wounded the skin and is a large wound, and you fear the occurrence of a hot abscess in that patient, then you should immediately bleed him and phlebotomize the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and extract blood according to the patient's strength unless some reason prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has come from the wound is scant.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side from the wounded part; and guard the patient from repletion and from wine and heavy foods.
But if any cause prohibits bloodletting, then let his food be reduced and he should not approach meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs there, a pledget soaked in rose oil alone or in wine in which a styptic has been dissolved.
But if it is certain that a hot abscess will form, then place on the wound, if it is recent, its own blood and, before the air changes it, the powder which I shall soon describe.
And if the air has already changed it, then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or is from a sword cut or the like, and its lips are not joined together by themselves, then join them with sutures according to the method of suturing which I shall describe.
But if the wound has exposed the bone and hangs, and there is not retention of it but a slight suspension, then incise it and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in place of the bone, and order the patient to be fed on foods which are thin:  broths and soft foods and similar, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that which is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood may occur, and it is not stopped by medicines, then you should investigate the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you should cut it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity compels you to do what we have said does not work, then you cauterize until the bleeding is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is light; therefore you should sprinkle on them this powder, for it consolidates them before the air changes them.
And the manner of making the powder is this: take olive oil one part, dragon's blood two parts, and unslaked lime three parts; let it all be well ground and sifted, and with it let the wound be filled, and let it be bound with a good bandage until it adheres well to it, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it above with powders and leave it, and do not unbind it while it is thus unless it becomes suppurated, for the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
And sometimes this alone suffices, when you do not have olive oil and dragon's blood at hand.
And do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary to apply it to them and they are fresh, and are recent wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially if it is in summer, then this powder is not suitable, but rather treat them with what we have said, so that you apply to them some digestive ointments, or that you apply to them powder from barley flour with water and honey until they exude pus; and then treat them with other cures until they are healed.
But if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then you extract it with tweezers.
And I will say the cure for head fractures in what follows.
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in medication between it and a simple head wound.
But if the nerves of the neck or an artery are incised, then if it is a nerve, there is no other remedy but to avoid treating it with something that has strong astringent properties, such as vitriol and things similar to it, because it harms the nerves and counteracts it. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold and continuous with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is healed with mild medicines, such as washing the wound with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or plain oil, and then, after washing with fresh water,  applying other softening poultices in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or draw the edges together, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep, or if there is pus at the lowest point of the wound, then perforate it at the lowest point.
But if an artery is incised in the wound and bleeding ensues, then separate or cut it, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or all of them have been incised, and the neck veins have been saved, then you should join the edges of the wound with sutures over the neck bone and do not touch it; first, equalize it and return it to its natural shape, and then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for some days; and then treat it with ointments which have styptic and healing properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has damaged the bone, then cauterize it, and then if there are bone fragments, extract all that you can; and what you cannot manage, leave it until the wound suppurates, and is separated and the injury is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle upon it the powder which has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with that which will be recalled in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider further if there is a discharge of air from the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is recent with its blood, then in the first hour you apply powder, and do not bind it tightly lest the blood be retained in its depth and return to the heart and kill the patient, but apply attractive ointment, and unbind it twice a day.
And if ointment is not at hand, then place old linen on the opening of the wound to absorb what comes from the humors; and have the patient sleep on the wound so that what is gathered there may drain.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and it has not caused the patient spasms, tremors of the heart, or constriction of the throat, and you see his other dispositions good, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with calls and other treatments until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; treat that then according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a cut by a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with what is prescribed for sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if damage has been done to the bone, and pieces have been cut from it, then you must clean the wound and try to extract those pieces, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound is suppurated, so that their extraction is easier.
And for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the treatment is similar to what we have described.
Of the wounds of the abdomen.
The ailment which happens in the abdomen is either great, or small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is treated differently, and it is such that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not take care of their replacement into their place immediately, because if it opens and swells, their insertion is made difficult.
Therefore the best rupture is moderate, because in that one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two species previously mentioned.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is according to four methods, but two sutures are common which are suitable for the suturing of other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures are specific,  communicating with the others [sutures], however they are more specific in the suturing of the abdomen.
And I will recount to you each one with explanation and clarification.
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has emerged through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore when this is so, then it is necessary that you warm it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone, or that you boil it in water with squill, cyperus, and spikenard, and bathe the intestine with it until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes this is done with vinegar, which has astringent properties, and is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And then, when you see the inflammation resolved, you moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and marshmallow have been boiled, for by this the entry of it is eased with little effort.
But if the entry of it is hindered despite this treatment, then incise the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is appropriate that there is no incision, and there is no need to dry it due to necessity and weakness.
Concerning the instrument, this is its form:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and the end is thin, but not as thin as a spatula; rather, it should be slightly blunt.
And so, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine protrudes, then its reduction should follow its natural form, to its proper place, if possible in this way, for this is better.
But when the rupture is large, and is in the lower part of the belly, then you should make the patient lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you should raise his head and feet higher than the lower parts.
Similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the belly, then always direct your attention and consideration to ensuring that the side where the wound is located is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this treatment in both large and medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, apply what you have prepared, and then have the assistant place their compassionate hands between your hands, holding the entire rupture with their hand and aligning its lips, and then discover from that to that which would be the suture or other appropriate cause.  (This last phrase is a bit ambiguous due to the archaic nature of the text.  It seems to suggest that the assistant should ensure proper alignment for the stitching or other closure technique).
And this is the common method of suturing: first, take the needle, or several needles according to the size of the wound; then, leave the distance from the end of the rupture to the annular finger, and tighten one needle, provided you do not place thread in the two ends of the suture, with two ends of the thread that is below the suture of the inner parts, until you make it penetrate that part; and you have already joined two ends of the suture and two ends of the thread, and thus four orders are made. (This is a difficult sentence to render perfectly into modern English due to the archaic phrasing and imprecise anatomical references. The "four orders" likely refers to some sort of methodical approach to securing the stitches).
Then tighten with double thread in the circuit of the needle, and sometimes on two parts at once, and then join the two lips of the wound with a decent joining; and then leave the thickness of a finger and place another needle in that space, and then tie it with thread as you did with the first needle; and do not cease to do this with needles as needed until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin, for thin needles cut the flesh too easily; and thick needles are difficult to thread, and therefore they should be of a moderate thickness.
And the needle should not be inserted too deeply into the two ends of the suture, lest the flesh be cut too easily and the wound open before it heals.
And the sutures should not be too long, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient during their sleep; and you will place on the suture powdered herbs from all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave those in place until you know that the wound is healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most convenient for small wounds, for in the suturing of these, one or two needles, or thereabouts, are sufficient.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you suture the four ends, of the wound and two ends of the lip, at once, with a needle around which is wound thread of suitable thinness and thickness.
Then, when with the needle you have penetrated these four ends, return the needle to the same side from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the highest part to the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth suture with which cloths are tightened.
And place between each suture the width of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And with such a suture I sewed up the wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than a palm, and about two palms of the middle intestine had come out, and the disruption was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been outside the wound for 24 hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he is healed; and afterwards he lived for many years, and remained in good health.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and it was by a miracle, for I did not cure him with ointment, for it was in a place where no ointment or any medicine was found, but I placed old linen on the wound twice a day and washed it frequently with honey water until it was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of sutures proper, according to the account of Galen. (Assuming "Paraula" is a variant spelling or corruption of Galen)
And it is that you begin with the suture of the [tail] (or possibly refers to a specific type of stitch), and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And then, as the needle penetrates the [tail/stitch] and that same laceration, following its width and length throughout the whole body, leave the end of the suture where you have inserted the needle; and make it penetrate at the other end, the needle from the inside to the outside at the other extremity of the wound.
And then, when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again at that same extremity of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the suture which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate at the other extremity from the inside to the outside.
And make it penetrate with that penetration with which you make it penetrate into the suture at the extremity of the wound which is on his side until all of that penetrates.
And then begin from that same side and sew that with the end that is from the suture on the other side, and extract the needle from the [tail/stitch] which you penetrated, and then return it to that [tail/stitch] and sew the end of the suture which is on the other side with this extremity of the wound; and extract it from the [tail/stitch] which is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this once then another time until you sew all that which is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a skin suture with which you sew skins, so that you sew the suture once from the side of the extremity of the [tail/stitch], and that you leave it another time until you have completed it.
But the second proper type of suture, which I call "Gualia," and this is spoken of by him and recounted by him, is that you sew it according to the similarity with which some physicians sew it, so that you join each part to its corresponding part naturally; and apply the end of one side and the end of the wound to the other end of the side, and this is done as I have recounted to you.
So that you place the needle at the end of the wound near the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner part in that place, and leave two ends of the suture; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside in two ends of the suture.
And then turn each of them, and make each one penetrate from the inside part to the outside part in two other ends of the wound which are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common, light suture, and it is the suture of which I previously made mention.
This is the discourse of Gualia.
And moreover, some say, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, that is, that you insert a thread into each of these, and begin with the insertion of the needle from the side that is towards you, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew hides together.
And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
But the judgment of the medication of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
The reason is that when you cleanse the fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestine and sew it and prepare it decently, then place incarnative powder on it.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then place on it some ointments that are present to you until they form a hard scab and the threads fall out, and they are consolidated with cyprus and myrrh; and then treat it as the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines present, then immediately place on it, as soon as it begins to suppurate, old linen, and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you do not need other medication in many situations when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will communicate infection to the principal members, then it is necessary that you submerge lamb's wool in oil of good quality, or in rose oil, and place it in the area around the armpits and under the arms.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in his intestines, because this often happens, then cauterize it with black, warm styptic wine, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and an opening has been made penetrating its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is of easier healing than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is of difficult healing because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not receive healing from a wound that falls upon it at all; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of the magnitude of those veins, and because of the subtlety of the body of that intestine, and because of its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is the web [likely referring to a membrane or tissue], and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your skill with which you reduce the intestines similarly.
But if it has passed into the space and has already become green or black, then bind it with gall over the place that is blackened, so that a flow of blood may come, because in the web are veins and arteries.
And then incise that which is beyond that ligament, and place two extremities of the gall hanging down from the part below the wound outside it, so that the attraction of it downwards towards the fall of the web and the emission of the arm of the wound may be relieved for you.
A remembrance/reminder of wounds when they happen in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some men, because of this, for I saw one who had been wounded in his belly with a lance thrust and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and had become a fistula, and from it came discharge and flatulence.
Then I pursued his cure, although I was not confident in his healing, but I continued to carefully treat it until it was healed and the place was consolidated (healed completely).
And I, after I saw the place consolidated, feared for the patient that some mishap might befall him in his belly; and no such ill accident occurred, and he remained in his usual good condition, eating and drinking, and then entered a bath and was exercised in his movements.
And some experienced people have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner: that you take ants with large heads; and then bring together the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants, with its mouth open, over the two lips of the wound; then when it bites and clenches its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere and not become detached.
And then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease doing this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the whole wound.
And then reduce (close) and sew the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm will come to the patient.
And it is also possible that the intestine be tied with fine thread which is made from the intestine of an animal, attached to it, since it is easier to thread with a needle; and it is done thus: you take the end of these threads from the intestine, and let it be well scraped clean, and then tie its end with the thread, wrapping it, and then insert this threaded needle and sew the intestine with it, and close it at the rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants is only a way of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, because then it is only a kind of alleviation, and not a complete healing of it.
Of the treatment of fistula and fistula.  (Note:  The word "zuchem" likely represents a variant spelling or a related term for fistula. The repetition suggests a clarification or emphasis on the condition.)
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated and discharges pus constantly and is not excised, then, in whatever member it may be, is universally called a fistula, and we call that a *zuchem*. (Again, *zuchem* seems to be a variant or related term for fistula.)
And a fistula, in truth, is a hardened, durable, white knot, which is painless and which has a concavity like the concavity of a bird's claw; and for this reason it is called a knotted ulcer, that is, a claw.
And in some men it is moist, which discharges pus; and quickly the moisture is excised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and it is little, and it is coarse, and it is subtle. (Describing variations in the consistency of the discharge).
I have already shown all those causes, and their signs, and their treatment with medicines in the division (of the treatise).
And it is necessary that I make you know the treatment of a fistula, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas which reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the diaphragm, or the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints composed by composition, such as those of the hand and foot; and those which cause damage to the proximity of a principal member and similar ones.
Therefore, that one of these fistulas which is according to this manner is one of the illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach those places that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its healing, and want to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, and seek it with it.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, because lead, with the lightness of its body, is eased and bent along the tortuosity.
And if the fistula has many branching paths, it is not possible for you to determine its course with a probe.
Then, inject a cleansing liquid (or apply a medicated wash) through its orifices, because the liquid with which you inject it goes through the other orifices and cleanses them.
And then inquire carefully, in what manner it is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and if the depth of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a fistula which has many orifices and remains there; do all this with the sum of your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain through your compression with your hand on the place, and similar signs and accidental causes to the abscess.
And when you have considered all those causes with true judgment, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and it is that you consider then if it is a fistula apparent and near, or in a safe place, far from a joint, or from a nerve, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from one of the places which I have told you.
Then you dry the fistula as described before in its description, and remove what is in that filtration and of corrupted flesh, and that which is grown in the orifice of the flesh, or of cartilage and the like, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it in the front as much as is possible for you, and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh; and then apply cauteries wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce them into the depth of the fistula, which you have understood with iron (meaning a surgical instrument).
And do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you should investigate it and dry it as we have recounted, if you are not prohibited by any vein, nerve, or principal member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that will cause it to grow flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption; and then uncover it again and meticulously perform the scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength, and then restore it.
And so, if it is healed, good; but if not, then know that that corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which you have not reached, and then for you in that case there is nothing to do but leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to remove it, then remove it with fine forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then meticulously remove all of them, and with your strength leave none of them behind.
But if some of the moist tissues hinder you, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them, then incise those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then place something on the wound that will cause it to suppurate, and leave it until it has reached the bones, flesh, and ligaments, and keep the wound from closing, and keep the incision you made constricted during your operation.
Furthermore, if you are afraid, place on it a cloth soaked in crushed rue with oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in one of the green ointments, for when those ligaments rot, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction is easier.
But if it is a large bone, such as a leg bone or thigh bone or similar, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it with a rasp only superficially until the blackness and corruption are removed, and then repair the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and incise everything up to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh so that you may use this as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a man young in age, around thirty years old, who experienced pain in his thigh, and from the inner parts, a sickness spread through the matter within the body until the matter reached the thigh, and it was a matter of an abscess with a large abscess, and there was no external cause for it.
And then time passed with that because of the mistakes of the physicians until the abscess was opened, and many materials flowed from it, and its healing was delayed until the leg was fistulated, and many orifices were made in it, all of which discharged pus and the humors of the body.
And then many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wisdom in them but in the art, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those orifices in great quantity; and the body of that man was quite emaciated, and his color was jaundiced.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and the probe reached the bone.
And then I examined all the orifices and found that they reached from all parts of the leg.
And then I carefully incised one of those orifices until I uncovered a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted, and it was already earthy, corrupted, and blackened; and a part of the leg was corrupted as far as the marrow.
And then I sawed away that which was exposed and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I believed that in the bone there was only that corruption which I cut away and sawed, and I had already removed it.
And then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidative medicine for a long time, and it did not heal.
And then I again investigated and uncovered the bone a second time, after the first uncovering, and I found continuing corruption in the bone.
And I sawed away what appeared to me to be that corruption, and then I was unable to effect its cure and restoration, and it was not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and did not cease to incise the bone little by little, bit by bit, and forcibly attempted its restoration, and it was not restored until I had incised about a palm's breadth of it, and that I extracted with its marrow; and then I restored that with medicines, and it was lightly consolidated and healed.
And further iteration in its operation and section is not necessary except for the disposition of its fragility and for the lack of its tolerance and fear of death, for syncope afflicted him at all hours due to an excess of evacuation.
And therefore it is healed by a complete healing, and nothing is in place of the hard bone flesh; and its disposition in its body is made good and its strength returned; and it is restored to its functions and caused him no impediment in walking nor harm in any way.
But if a bone protrudes from the body already excised, then you must treat that in this manner: that you take a ligature and bind that to the extremity of that protruding bone, and command someone to extend it upwards; and place that woolen ligature thicker than the first ligature; and then tie that over the flesh that is beneath the bone, and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh to the parts below, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or a board decently beneath the bone, for when you do this, the saw is not prohibited from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted area little by little, for if corruption is in the concavity of the bone and does not appear on its surface to the senses, force the sawing of it another time.
And if the bone is corrupted and not protruding, with one part continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part of it, then you uncover the flesh from all parts completely; and then place wood underneath, and then saw it from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous with the other part.
And let the sawing be according to the location of the corruption, little by little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in the reason but in the ingenuity [or skill/cleverness].
And if the corruption is in the chest of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, it is necessary that you inquire into the corruption in whatever manner appears to you, and that you open that, and clean that according to each disposition which is possible for you, and with each tool it should be rectified for you, when it does not cause you harm to a vein or nerve.
And know that the incisors and saws for incising these bones are many according to the location of the bones, and the preparation of those, and the thickness of those, and the subtlety and the size and the smallness of those, and the hardness and their rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument convenient to that operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the type of instrument of which you have need; when with you there is great study and long and deep knowledge of the ways of this art, and experience of many kinds of illnesses, because then you will already have for yourself that which is convenient for the instruments for every illness.
And I am showing you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will have simply, with which you will proceed to your practice which you will test upon others. Shape of saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of another large saw:
Shape of a ray (or beam/spoke): Let the head of this ray be according to the shape of a star-shaped key head, and its points be according to the shape of the points of a [possibly referring to a specific tool -  "alstefegi" isn't directly translatable, it might be a type of awl or a similar pointed instrument].
And it is only suitable that with that [instrument/tool described above] the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the opening is very wide.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a broad/wide razor:
Shape of another saw decently made: let its arc be made as curved as possible and its sharpness of iron, and its handle of wood, a handle decently made. Its shape/form:
Shape of a razor which has a concavity:
Shape of another, subtle razor:
Shape of another razor with a curved end:
Shape of a small razor similar to a probe:
Shape of another, smaller incisor:
Shape of another incisor; this one resembles a ray, and its end is like a saw, and is used in many places in the treatment of bones:
Shape of a ray which is suitable for the treatment of those bones which are perforated:
And its end is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, it is necessary that all the things we have said about razors, and incisors, and saws.
Of the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
If the extremities become diseased due to an intrinsic or extrinsic cause, or if you have treated that corruption with medicines and the treatment is not effective, or you see the corruption spreading through the limb without any apparent cause, then you must incise that limb to the point where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may escape death or a worse affliction which is a greater impairment of the limb.
And the sign of this affliction is that the limb turns black as if it were burned by fire, or the blackness spreads until the putrefaction reaches that limb, affecting it and potentially the whole body; therefore, treat it with incision.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the impact of some poisonous substance, such as a sea scorpion, viper, or shrew, and the like.
And if the corruption or injury is in the extremity of a finger, then you should incise the finger and not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.
Similarly, if it affects the hand, then you should incise it at the root of the palm, and not allow the corruption to spread to the forearm.
And if it affects the arm, then incise the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption spreads beyond the elbow, then in that case the patient's death is certain; and administering any other treatment beyond that point is futile.
Similarly, if corruption affects a toe, then you should incise it up to one of the ankle bones.
And if it takes hold in the instep of the foot, then you should incise the entire foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you should incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy for him but resignation, and to leave the patient to death.
And the manner of incising a limb or cauterizing it is that you should tighten a ligature on the part below where you wish to incise, and tighten another ligature above the location; and let the assistant extend a ligature to the parts below, and let the assistant extend another ligature above; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures, so that all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be incised or cauterized.
And it is necessary that a clean cloth be placed on all parts so that it does not touch the healthy area, and that the patient receives a proper incision and a hot poultice.
But if a flow of blood occurs while you are working, then you should carefully cauterize the affected area, or apply some styptic powders to it; and then return to your treatment until it is complete.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have recounted to you, which is that a blackness occurred in his foot with a burning that resembled a fire burn.
And that corruption occurred first in his toe until it spread to the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself, because he saw the healing progress in the limb with such vehemence that he suffered from pain and burning, and he incised that foot up to the joint, and it healed.
Long afterwards, the same corruption occurred in the index finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I tried to repel that excess with what I possessed in the way of medicines, for the purification of his body; but the excess was not repelled and began to spread to another finger until it reached his hand.
And he asked me to incise his hand, but I did not want to do that, hoping for the repulsion of that excess, and more than that, I feared death from the incision of his hand, because the patient's strength was failing.
And after he departed from me, he returned to his land, and it came to me that that man prepared and incised his whole hand, and he was healed.
And this narrative is added only so that it may be a help in the treatment of this disease, and that it may be a sign by which it may be recognized and according to which it may be treated.
Concerning the treatment of sinuses and the nature/quality of clysterization with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in fleshy members and the space of the abscess is extended until it forms a collection of pus, and then it is broken and perforated, and the pus comes out of it, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is over it is like thin cloth, and it has not reached further corruption, and does not affect the bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and it is not called a fistula.
But however, if the space is extended so that the corruption affects any member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And its cure is that you incise that skin completely as it is rolled up, especially when it is thinned and made like cloth, and make sure that it does not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin will adhere and that the corruption has not reached a further stage, and there is thickening of the skin, then you treat that with a clyster.
And it is that you consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the pus from it is foul-smelling, then clysterize it with an Egyptian medicine which is made of oil, sour wine, and resin, taking equal parts, and they are mixed in a vessel, and they are heated over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then you take what is necessary from it and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize the sinus with this, and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
And then extract that with a syringe; and do this for so many days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul smell is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with lye water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is that you take the ashes of wood, and put water over them; and then filter that and clysterize with it until you are sure that the sinus is clean.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the lye water, then clysterize it with water and honey, and to which crushed resin is mixed, and clysterize with wine and honey mixed, for it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash, and the wine causes it to adhere to the sinus, and especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are sure that the sinus is clean, then clysterize it with something that causes the flesh to grow there.
And it is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or that you clysterize it with other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written in the treatise of ointments.
And if the orifice of the sinus is narrow, so that the clyster cannula cannot be inserted, then enlarge it little by little with a small iron instrument, and place in it a small tent wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it is enlarged.
And similarly, if the orifice is wide, then you should approximate its lips with sutures and leave an opening sufficient for the clyster to enter without addition [of further enlargement].
And if the orifice from which the pus flows is situated higher than the lower parts, then drain it at the lowest point so that the pus flows downwards, because when the pus is confined in the depth of the sinus, the flesh will not regenerate there.
And if it is not possible for you to drain the sinus into the lowest surrounding bone as desired, then ensure that you prepare the member with a preparation by which the pus flows lightly as is fitting, and that nothing is retained in it to obstruct the flow of pus.
But the cloth that is over the orifice of the sinus, that one you should change every hour so that the pus that accumulates there may exit. And so that you may know if the pus that flows from it is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And with this, consider the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter that is expelled onto the orifice of the sinus is already adhering, or is becoming adherent, then on the third day loosen it; and when you loosen the dressing, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if near the sinus there is a subtle poison, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is near, for there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and there are others in whom the opposite is true.
And if undigested pus has issued from the sinus for many days, then know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause prolonged, then you should adjust the drying quality of the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are dried as with diafinicon ointment when superfluity of addition of zegi is adjusted in it.
And the best remedy with which it is cured, is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and let old wine be mixed into its substance, and mix that well with it, and use that.
And it acts similarly in that case, when there is no pus: diafinicon ointment, honey cooked until it thickens, and use it; or take myrrh, aloes, and incense, grind everything and powder it over the honey while it is on the fire, then apply this on a cloth and bind it over the sinus; and apply that with the honey which you have cooked until it thickens, and powder it on a cloth and bind it.
And sometimes long birthwort and roots of lily of the valley (and it is lily of the valley) and barley flour and centaury are administered with it, and use these simples or compounded, grind those, sift them and powder them over the honey which has been mentioned; and use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the depth of it, and it has already reached the bones or other hard parts or ligaments; then you cure it with fistular treatment, as has been said above.
Concerning the treatment of paronychia, and worn nails, and added finger incision, and section.
Paronychia is an abscess which arises under the nail of the finger or toe of the hand or foot, and quickly arises in other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its cure is less prized, or it is suppurated from a hot abscess, or is corrupt, and pus comes out until it corrodes the root of the nail, and quickly corrupts the whole of it, and quickly its corruption penetrates to the bone until there is a foul odor, and the extremity of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.
And therefore when you have this with that which we have said in the division and you do not find success with your treatment, then it is necessary that you incise with iron all the superfluity that remains of the nail and then cauterize the wound there, because much cautery is beneficial in this.
But if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the additions of the nail, emptied, already compress the flesh in the underlying parts, and begin to prick and injure it, then it is necessary that you place a thin blade under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it up and incise that flesh easily, and put on what remains of the flesh corrosive burning medicines until all is consumed; and then cure that with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption already penetrates the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone and extract it, for at no time is it healed if there is corrupt bone in it.
And if you see the corrosion and corruption go into the finger, then you incise it at one of the joints according to the need, and then cure it until it is healed.
But if a blow or friction happens to the nail, and there is vehement pain in it, then it is necessary that you first bleed the patient, and then cut the nail with a sharp instrument with a transverse cut from above downwards, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause the patient vehement pain, and it will be a cause of the generation of superfluous flesh in the place; and then cure that place with something that alleviates pain.
But a finger that is born in the hands of some men is quickly all fleshy, and quickly has bones in it, or quickly has a nail.
And some of them are born at the root of the joint, or their birth is at some joint of the fingers. But that which is born at some joint of the finger does not hurt, and that which is born at the joints is quickly painful.
And of those that are born fleshy, the excision is easy, and it is that you incise that one below its root with a broad instrument.
But of that which is born at the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of its excision.
But in that which is born on a finger between the joints, it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a round incision down to the bone, and then close it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then treat it until it is healed.
But consolidation which happens to the fingers between their knuckles, either by the birth of a man born thus, or by the consolidation of a wound, or by burning with fire, or similarly, then it is necessary that you cut that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in rose oil so that they are not lightly consolidated, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until it is consolidated as is necessary.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you cut that consolidation according to how it is formed and suitable to the shape of the limb.
Concerning incisions of vices, there are several.
Vices are varicose veins, and they are thick, convoluted veins full of melancholic superfluities which appear in many parts of the body, and most often in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.
But the cure of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are incised and that black blood is drawn out, and the other method is that the vein is raised and entirely extracted.
The incision is done in this manner: first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick, feculent blood is resolved from the leg. Then bind the patient's leg tightly from the highest part of the thigh to the area below the knee with a bandage, and then cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision. Then, with your hand,  raise the black blood from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from above downwards, until the desired quantity of blood has been released—enough to weaken the strength of the disease.
Then bind it up, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the phlebotomy treatment when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
But their elevation is according to this method: you who shave the patient's leg, if there is much hair on it, and then place it in a bath and bathe the leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins become prominent; or, if a bath is not available, have the limb heated through vigorous exercise, until the limb is warmed.
Then cut the vein in the area of the vein, lengthwise or behind it below the knee, or at its lowest point below the ankle.
Then open the vein with an incision and scrape the vein on all sides until it feels sensitive, and it is from its appearance that you see this redness leaning toward blackness.
And then, when you have opened the vein, you see that which is white, like a cord.
Then you place a thread under it so that it is raised and pulled away from the vein, and suspend it with a golden hook.
Then make another incision near that incision for three fingers' breadth, and scrape the vein from the area above the vein until it appears.
Then lift it and incise it in the second incision near the heel, and then extract it and lift it until it comes out through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until it is all extracted; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey you in being extracted and lifted, then insert a needle with strong double thread and tie it and extract it, or insert a thread under it and rotate your hand in all directions until it is pulled out. And be careful that it is not incised; for if it is broken, it is made difficult for you to lift it and it becomes harmful to the patient.
And when you have completely removed it, then place on the wound site wool soaked in rose-wine and olive oil, both rose-scented and unscented, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is contracted, having a tortuosity to which there is a twisting in parts, and it is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary that you make incisions on it at each part of its tortuosity and at the places of its twisting, and then suspend it with hooks until you lift it completely.
And be careful in your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not injure it, for it will be difficult for you to lift it; and use your prudence in this.
The form of the incision with which the intestine is cut:
It is not sharpened like hooks, nor is it of a sharp extremity so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of a thick, flexible lion [likely meaning "shape" or a similar descriptive word; "leon" seems to be a scribal error], for if it were thin, it would cut the vein by its thinness; therefore it has superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as al-Ategi in the land of the Arabs, and in the hot and arid lands of India, of little humidity, and in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And it is easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents, worms, scabies, and maggots are generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the beginning of this vein is that vehement inflammation occurs in the leg; and near the place it is blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blister, which resembles the root of a plant.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one to two drachms, and tie it, leaving the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as there is any cause of it on the outer parts, wrap it in lead and tie it. And if the growth is prolonged, then you should incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise the root until it has emerged, for if you incise it, it is retracted and enters the flesh and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place and a bad ulceration.
Therefore it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is completely expelled and no cause of it remains in the body.
And from this vein has come forth in some men a growth that is five palms and fingers in length, and it has already reached me that one of twenty palms has come forth.
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, then insert a probe into its opening and perforate it with a long opening to the body, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the place for some days with medicines; and then cure it with the cure for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many orifices come to it, and a branch emerges from each orifice.
And therefore cure it in the way we have said in the division and with what has been said above.
Concerning the incision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
This illness is called in some lands bovine illness because it often happens to cattle, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and goes throughout the body rising and falling, and is shown by its movement from limb to limb until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms, snakes, earthworms, and ascarids are generated in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, for when it goes into the body and is elevated to the head, and has reached the eye, then very quickly it enters it and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure this and extract it, then it is done only by observing its movement and appearance to the senses, and then it is necessary that you bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong bandage and constriction, and then dry it above and extract it.
And if it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you do not find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies, and the greatest fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the place, as we have said.
But if you see it has reached the head near the eye, then bind above the eyebrow with a strong constriction, and then dry above it, and extract it; and the patient must purify their body with medicines that evacuate bad putrid humors, and guard against foods that generate putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the disease *nafir*.  (Note: "nafir" appears to be a disease name not readily identifiable in modern medical terminology.  Further context would be helpful.)
This illness is called *nafir* in our land, and it is a pain which comes in some limbs, and then is moved from limb to limb.
And I have seen that, as I will recount to you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small swelling in the superficial vein of the arm, and after it had remained for an hour, I saw that swelling moving like a worm climbing upwards, but more lightly than a worm, as if it were quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and fixed itself in the muscle, and there it remained for about an hour.
And then it ran to the other side until it reached the other arm.
And then I realised that it was moving throughout her body, as I saw; and I was very astonished by its change of location and its speed from limb to limb. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in this manner, however I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my eyes as clearly as in the woman.
And I thought it was because the woman was old, with a dry body and exposed veins, and in this way that shifting windiness appeared noticeable.
And it is necessary that it does not appear according to this observation in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press on that area gently and dry it until that constricted windiness is expelled, and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you treat it with chest percussion and with things that expel windiness, and drive it away with foul-smelling pills and pills of scammony and the like.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in the body where they lodge, for their diversity is such that there are those with large points, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones, that is, solid ones; and those that have three edges, and those which have barbs; and those which have feathers.
And of the signs in the brain, if an arrow lodges there and penetrates the bone, and emerges from the cranium which is over the brain, for it causes sudden faintness, and dimness of vision, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile, and speech is quickly cut off and the voice is destroyed, and there emerges from the place of the wound a white moisture resembling pus, and matter from it similar to the watery substance of flesh.
And therefore if these signs appear to you, then abstain from the cure and the extraction of the arrow, unless it is already outside.
But the signs of the arrow when it lodges in the heart, are that it is near the left breast, and one feels as if it were fixed in something hard, and not in something empty; and very quickly the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting; and therefore know that death follows without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are thus: frothy blood issues from the wound, and the vessels which are near the neck are inflamed, and the patient's color is changed, and he breathes with great difficulty, and desires the inhalation of cool air.
And if the arrow lodges in the diaphragm which is in the chest, then the pain is near the lower ribs, and the breathing is labored with intense pain and with sighing, and not all the muscles of the limbs are affected.
And if the arrow lodges in the stomach, then very quickly some undigested food comes from the wound.
And if the arrow lodges in the abdomen, and is fixed there, some tear comes from the wound, or the membrane, or intestine which is ruptured, and there is no hope of cure without extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow lodges in the bladder, and urine flows out, and some matter progresses from it to the outer parts, and strong pain quickly comes upon the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other members, such as the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the armpits, and the vertebrae of the back, and the clavicle, and the hip, and the leg and similar members, are saved according to the best dispositions when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I recount this to you that I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may signify from this about your cure.
The reason is that in one man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye at the root of his nose, and I extracted it for him from the other side, below the lobe of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which had fallen into him in the lobe of his eye, below the eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden and I found only a small extremity with which it adhered to its shaft, and it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion-shaped head, in which there were no barbs.
And the Jew was healed, and no ill accident befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had fallen into his throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, and it is one which has barbs; and then I incised upon it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I was subtle with it, and I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and therefore, since thirty days had passed and nothing had changed in his condition, I incised over the arrow and extracted it, and he was healed, and no ill accident befell him.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow had fallen in his back, and the wound had healed over him, and after about seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman into whom an arrow had fallen in her belly, and the wound is healed within her, and nothing has changed in her condition, and the woman found no impediment in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow had fallen in his face, and the wound is healed and the arrow broken, finding no great pain, and many similar to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king's man that had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already inclined a little to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to his cure concerning the arrow wound within three days.
And then I found the wound from the arrow very narrow; and then I probed it with a slender probe, and did not feel it; but he felt a prickling under his right ear, and then I suspected that that prickling was from the point of the arrow.
And I plastered the area with a plaster which has attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the area would fester so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could operate on it.
And no significant accident occurred in the area that the arrow had reached; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no accident occurred; and the wound was meanwhile consolidated, and the patient refrained from extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow within his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with a probe I examined it, and found the tip of the arrow, which was very thin and adhered to the shaft.
And then I carefully applied the sharp medicine to the opening of the wound until the point of the arrow appeared visibly to me, and I spent time with this for a period of up to four months.
And then, when the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and remove it, and I did not succeed in this way, then I did not cease to refine and devise methods for this, until one day I managed with ingeniously made forceps, as the form of these will be shown at the end of the chapter, to extract it; and then I restored the wound.
And some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound is healed, and the patient is completely healthy, and he suffered no ill effects.
And I recounted to you the method of extraction of certain arrows so that you may establish a rule and understanding on this matter that I have not described, for the details of this art and its definitions are not comprehensively covered in narrative or included in this book.
And skillful artisans compare the small with the large; and the present with the absent; and find new operations and instruments because of the unforeseen occurrences of strange causes in the art.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not expelled from the members into which they are fixed except in two ways: either by attraction from the place where they are lodged; or by the opposite action from the other side.
And that which is expelled from the place where it entered, is an arrow embedded in fleshy tissue, and is drawn out and expelled.
And if it does not yield to removal at the time it is discovered, then it is necessary that you leave it for some days until the flesh surrounding it softens, and its extraction and removal are facilitated.
And similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not yield to removal, then leave it for some days and repeatedly attempt its extraction and movement each day, and eventually it will be expelled.
And if it does not yield to removal after some days, then it is necessary that you perforate the area around the arrow in that bone on all sides with a thin drill until the area around the arrow is widened, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden in the body and is hidden from sight, then you should search for it with a probe, and if you feel it, then draw it out with some instrument that is suitable for its extraction.
And if you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the projectile, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then you should incise the wound until it is enlarged enough to allow the arrow to be extracted.
And if it is held by barbs, then you should free the flesh in which it is embedded from all sides with all the skill you can muster; and attempt this, if you cannot otherwise, by the excision of the flesh at the barbs and by twisting them until they yield.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use twisting with your hand and forceps in all parts until it yields; and proceed with great subtlety so that the arrow is not broken and that a difficult extraction is not made for you.
And if you cannot manage it immediately, then you should wait for a few days until the parts surrounding it can soften, and then try again, for it will then be easier. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then you should apply the treatments we described in the relevant chapter.
And be careful about cutting a vein or nerve, or tendon, and use all possible skill to remove the arrow; and do this with ease, calmness, slowness and firmness, as I have recommended to you.
And therefore you should make a counter-incision so that the patient is aligned with the position of the arrow, because that is more helpful. But if that is not possible, then administer what you can, according to the circumstances.
But if arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part of it projects outwards, or if the tip of the arrow causes swelling due to the feeling in the part above the deep wound and sometimes that prominence; then you should make an incision there; and the incision should be the size that the forceps can grasp; and then pull it out, for it will then be easily removed.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then twist the blade against it until the arrow is loosened from the bone, and widen the opening yourself, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is within, then push it all the way through.
But if the shaft has fallen off and you want to administer a push, then introduce, if it is blunt, a concave instrument so that the concavity fits onto the arrowhead, and then push it through.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then push it through with a strong instrument entering it, because the arrow is aided by this.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must carefully remove all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow is lodged in the foot, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut it out, then cut it out and be careful to avoid cutting a vein or nerve, and remove it, and then dress the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
The form of forceps with which arrows are extracted:
Let the ends of their jaws be like the beak of a bird, made like a saw when they grip the arrow so that they do not let go of it.
And of these there are many types, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the size of the wound, and the tightness of the location.
like a ray, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins from which it is customary to perform phlebotomy are thirty, of which sixteen are in the head; that is, two pulsating veins which are near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins that are in the two apparent temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called *aspicientz*; and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the end of the nose; and two veins that are at the neck; and two veins that are in the upper lip; and two veins that are in the lower lip; and — these are the veins that are called *algelic* —; and there are two veins that are under the tongue. But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five; for of these there is one cephalic, and it is next to the wild vein; and the people call it "the vein of the head", and it is a thick vein and is composed of a branch of the basilic, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people name that one "vein of the whole body", and the basilic is the vein which is situated in the domestic vein, and is named "citillar", and the common people call it "vein of the belly"; and the vein of the arm, and it is situated on the forearm, and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the elbow by manifest appearance; and the *salvatella*, and it is the vein that is between the auricular finger and the little finger, and it has two branches in it.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of these is below the curvature of the knee of the wild vein; and the second is the saphena, and its location is below the leg of the domestic vein; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg of the wild vein; and in the leg there are other veins similar to those.
The benefit of opening the veins near the ears is for chronic catarrhs, migraine, headaches, and old, malignant head ulcers.
And the method of bleeding those veins is as I have recounted to you: it is that the head of the patient should be raised, and the patient's head should be rubbed at the occiput in the area of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then the patient should tighten their neck with a bandage until the two veins and their locations appear near the ears in two depressed places of the head; and seek them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those veins with your finger, bleed them there cautiously.
Then you take the lancet knife, which is sharp, and you insert it under the vein in the incision until the blood comes out. Then raise your hand with the vein and the incision to the upper parts and incise the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers joined, or thereabouts; and let blood flow as much as you wish.
Then bind it with powders and leave it until it is healed.
And already, at the beginning of the book, the incision of these and their cauterization has been described.
But for the two arteries in the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for chronic and sudden severe migraine, and persistent ophthalmia, and a flow of acute superfluities effused into the eyes.
And the way to phlebotomize those is as I recounted to you:  constrain the patient's neck so that the two veins appear to the touch by manifest appearance and their pulse is felt beneath your finger; and then you bleed with a lancet.
Then you raise the skin above the vein at the upper part with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy instrument underneath, and raise the vein upward; and incise it just as you did the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your need.
And then loosen the patient's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then place cotton and powder on it and bind it tightly above, and leave it until it is healed.
And already the recollection of them, and their incision, and the drawing (of blood) has been preceded at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, bloodletting from the frontal vein is useful for old facial ailments, and for migraine, redness, and foul-smelling ulcers.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is as I relate to you; that is, that the patient should tighten his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is called a fossor, of which this is the form:
Place the prominent point, which is at the head of the fossor, upon that vein and strike it with a hammer or other similar object, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you desire; and then loosen the patient's binding and tighten it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lancet, however, it is not fitting that the lancet be of a sharp point like the other lancets, rather it should be of a broad point, and bleed according to the crosswise direction, because the bone is near and would easily be broken by the lancet when it is sharp.
But bloodletting from the two veins that are at the lacrimal ducts of the two eyes is useful for scabies of the eyes, for redness and swelling in the eyes, and for facial ailments.
And the manner of the phlebotomy is that the patient should tighten his neck with a bandage, and then you should bleed him, and you should be standing above his head.
And let the phlebotomy be done transversely rather than lengthwise, with a small lancet, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the lancet is sharp, its point will be easily broken.
And then make the blood flow as much as is necessary for you, and place cotton on it, and bind it for a night, and then unbind it.
But phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and severe headache, and for facial ailments, migraine, and redness that occurs in the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient should tighten his neck and then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin lancet and insert it into the middle of the nasal bridge in a straight line, because the vein is not palpable there, and because the blood will immediately begin to flow.
So that you gently move your hand with the small lancet and let the blood flow according to your need; and then bind it for a night, for it is lightly restored.
But bloodletting from the two jugular veins is helpful for the constriction of the throat, the beginning of leprosy, many diseases, impetigo, and bad, corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the manner of bloodletting from these veins is that the patient should tighten each one with a bandage below his neck; and the surgeon should stand above the patient's head, and the patient should be seated on a stool.
Then bleed the vein lengthwise with a wide lancet little by little; and then extract blood according to a measured quantity or according to what the need requires; and then do likewise with the other vein.
Then untie the bandage and tighten the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning, for the wound is healed.
And bloodletting from the alveolar veins benefits small abscesses and pustules of the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of bloodletting from these veins is that you make the patient sit before you, and tighten his neck with a bandage, and then roll back his lips and look for two veins, one of which is on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the identification of each is by the blackness of each of the two, and this is more so because in the vicinity of these are small black veins; and then incise each with an appropriate incision.
But if you are in doubt, and do not know which is which, then you should incise the larger and more evident of them.
And do the same for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of the two veins below the tongue, bloodletting is beneficial for the cephalalgia (headache) that are in the throat, for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing these is that you hold the patient between your hands in front of the sun, and elevate his tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side you will see a vein and on the other side a vein, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to overuse your hand in phlebotomizing these, because below these are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the neck are those that run customarily in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either they use a lancet or olive-shaped phlebotomy instrument with a thin point; or they incise with a cupping phlebotomy instrument, and they call this alnessil (a possible misspelling or regional term), and this is its form:
Let its width be like this, as you see, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy instrument is of lesser width and a more subtle point, and is suitable for phlebotomy of thin veins containing thin, clear blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: because it draws out the blood of the illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and of that which affects the feet and the belly.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, that he guards it well and is very careful, because beneath it is an artery, and if he errs and is inaccurate in the puncture with the phlebotomy instrument, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood, so that it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a sharp phlebotomy instrument, before it is cut with a lancet.
And if the basilic vein does not appear in manifest form, then it is necessary that you leave that one and that you move to another, or that you seek some branch of it; or that you phlebotomize in the place of its end in the arm, for that one is manifest; and cut it with a lancet phlebotomy instrument as we have said.
But if you wish phlebotomy in the same place, then before the constriction of the arm, it is necessary that you touch the place until you know the location of the pulse, and then mark it with a marker; and then bind the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision with a lancet phlebotomy instrument, as we have said; and be careful that the incision does not fall into the space of the artery's location.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, inflation in the place you have marked with the marker, then that inflation is inflation of the artery, and therefore avoid that.
And if you see the blood flow from the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then you will know that it is from the artery; and then you watch and place your finger on it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood is cut off (because many times it is), then you tighten the arm and leave it.
And watch the patient for their mucus, and be vigilant over them and do not anger them for some days until they are healed.
But if the blood is not cut off, and you see that you do not have a remedy for this, then you incise the artery, if it seems appropriate to you; because its extremity is constricted, and the blood is cut off; or that you take bark of a fig tree, and make it into powder, and take one half and apply it tightly to the place of the vein with a descending constriction using a ligature and powders until the next day.
And then if the blood is cut off, it is good; and if not, then treat it with that which is mentioned previously in the recollection of the place concerning the powders that stop the flow of blood.
And the stopping of the patient's blood is difficult in many cases because of the small size of the wound and the difficulty in binding the arm.
But in the dark vein, phlebotomy is helpful to extract blood from the superior part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed of branches of the basilica and branches of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it behooves the phlebotomist to be very careful in phlebotomy, for beneath it is a nerve; and if it is pierced during phlebotomy and the nerve is found, the patient will suffer numbness, and healing will be difficult, and very rarely is it ever completely healed.  And this nerve often appears clearly; and if it is hidden from some men and is subtle and not visible, then you should place the phlebotomy instrument with which you perform phlebotomy with a slanting incision, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should open the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and provides relief for diseases of the eyes.
And it is proper in this case, if you wish the phlebotomist to puncture with an olive-shaped phlebotomy instrument or a myrtle-shaped phlebotomy instrument; because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
However, in some men, an abscess forms very quickly when it is not phlebotomized on the first attempt, but this abscess does no harm.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and for its hope and caution against the onset of diseases, and that phlebotomy should be performed in one of the veins that are in the arm, that is: cephalic, median, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtime, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the third day or the first, after three hours have passed from the day.
But phlebotomy, which is administered, more when it provokes convenience and necessity for it, either by night or by day, at all hours and at all times.
And it is necessary that a child not be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be phlebotomized except from the fourth month until the seventh, and old women who have passed sixty years should not be phlebotomized.
And if someone wants to be phlebotomized in any way, they must cleanse their bowels before phlebotomy with a cleansing enema, if there is much retained waste in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities into the phlebotomy from the bowels, which are putrid, and that they do not harm the principal members.
And let not patients with persistent nausea and diarrhea be phlebotomized, nor those recovering from illness or fever until that is removed from them, nor those suffering from dropsy; and moreover, phlebotomy should be avoided near colicky pain, and near vomiting, and near abdominal pain, and near excessive coitus and exertion and exercise, fasting or vigils, and every cause that diminishes strength, whether corporeal or animal.
And consider carefully the thinning of humors beforehand, if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines, if that is possible for him.
And then enter a bath if no cause prohibits it, or be exercised by some activity so that the blood is thinned.
And perform the phlebotomy in the middle of the day, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all harmful accidents, both animal, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and from all bodily accidents, such as excessive work and pain, and coitus, and things similar to them.
And at his bedside, let there be present things whose use is customary among men, with aromatics and perfumes and with balsams and things similar to them, according to what is possible.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be phlebotomized.
Then, let the phlebotomist pull out his arm, and rub it with his hand two or three times; and then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is not equal, or the constriction is excessive, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it prevents the blood from flowing out.
And near the constriction, it is necessary that the one who is to be phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly visible.
Then the phlebotomist should anoint his fleam with a little old oil; and then place the index finger of his left hand on the vein, below the place where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein moves slightly, and the percussion is stopped because some veins are like a fleeing string; you must avoid phlebotomy on those veins that are full of wind, and when you place the fleam on such a vein, it shrinks away from the fleam, and is rejected by the phlebotomist; and the fleam does not open the vein, and if it does open it, then it is constricted.
Therefore, the phlebotomist must be skilled and attentive to all these matters.
Then apply the fleam; but if the vein is opened at once, it is good; and if not, repeat the process in another place a little below, or above it with haste, if the area is not inflamed.
And if the area is inflamed, or the patient is frightened, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, because it will quickly draw hot pus, nor should the patient enter a bath.
Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows slowly, and you fear that you will not obtain the desired quantity of blood, then repeat the phlebotomy in that incision according to its straightness, and enlarge the opening a little, and do this quickly before the area becomes inflamed, because the area becomes inflamed in many men even with a small opening.
But if you see that it is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it will not help you at all; and place on it some part of a split olive, for it relieves the body of blood. And olive oil is better in this instance than other oils.
Similarly, administer a split olive in all phlebotomies with which you phlebotomize veins, in order to prevent the clotting of blood; and they do this with theriac and sagapenum when one of these is placed on the area, because the blood is thinned and its thickness is reduced.
And if a large abscess is generated at the site of the phlebotomy—for this often happens, especially to one who has not been bled before, or when the vein opening is small—then consider this, and place on the area a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water, and compress it for an hour, for it will dissolve [the abscess].
And it is necessary to do this immediately after the bleeding from that vein, in conjunction with it or another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the place for some days, do not worry; and if you wish, place on it some dissolved aloes and myrrh, or some mint juice or calamint, or something similar.
And abscesses and swellings often occur after phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And then place your hand on it, and if then you find softness under your compression on it, then that swelling is malignant and bad; and then take care that you place on it something of what we have said, for blood will very quickly flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has styptic properties, so that the place is hardened, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract blood from every man according to the quantity of his strength and according to the color predominating in the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for him who is full and strong and needs bloodletting at once, that the phlebotomy of the vein be amplified and the phlebotomy be wide.
And in one who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to extract [blood] in several times, and that the opening be narrow.
And the best way to administer venesection is that the incision be transverse, not a puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safe from blood flow and nerve incision, and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to breadth and length.
And to whom syncope is accustomed to occur after phlebotomy, it is necessary that you treat that person before phlebotomy with a little bread infused in pomegranate wine or simple warmed oxymel; and extract the blood in three or four times.
And if there is coldness of complexion, then take before phlebotomy bread infused in syrup of myrrh or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and the like, or in an aromatized and very fragrant syrup.
And if syncope occurs after phlebotomy, and it is caused by the loss of much blood, then it is necessary that [the patient] take as a drink meat broth and a very subtly fragrant syrup; and use aromatics with rue, and let his feet be warmed with it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope by evacuation.
And whoever wishes to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time, it is necessary for him, for whom phlebotomy is for the purpose of evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he evacuate the blood little by little, that is, according to the amount of strength over continuous days.
But whoever wishes to bleed his arm and shed his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do so after seven or nine hours from the first phlebotomy.
But whoever wishes to draw blood from his body away from the part to which it declines, it is necessary that he be bled on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much already heated blood, and is acute and causes fever to arise, it is necessary that blood be shed from him at once and that a large quantity be shed from him and the opening be widened until syncope occurs, provided that you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on his pulse below the heart, so that death does not result instead of syncope, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not necessary, when you wish to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, that since the opening of the vein is already closed and the exit of the blood is made difficult, that you press on it with vehemence and that it be bent and extended lightly, for this is very bad.
Having left it until he is bled a second time; or remove it with the sharpness of the phlebotomy instrument, which is coagulated blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it theriac, or  aloe, and compress it with a light compression until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is abscessed, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess is subsided.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed him in that place or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "the rope of the arm" is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic or basilic vein, when they are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of them.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient should immerse his hand in warm water until the vein reddens and appears manifestly.
Then it should be bound above with a bandage of moderate tightness; and then phlebotomize according to the small transversal, neither latitudinally nor longitudinally.
And let the opening be wide, and perform your phlebotomy with which you bleed him above the joint of the hand a little.
And if the flow of blood is impeded, then immerse the hand again in warm water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your objective.
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from re-immersion of the hand in warm water, and the same is prescribed for placing the blood basin in warm water in winter time.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than of all other veins, for beneath it there is neither pulsating vein nor nerve.
And phlebotomy of the little vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the manner of this phlebotomy is that you bind the hand tightly with a ligature or with your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you cut it completely, it will not harm in any way.
And be careful not to extend your cut too far with the phlebotomy, for beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, denuded of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water and let the blood flow into it, for if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and [the flow] is prohibited [from happening].
And when the blood has been drawn according to the necessary amount, then you place oil and salt on the vein, so that it is not quickly sealed; and similarly you should do in every narrow vein.
But the benefit of phlebotomy in the left hand is that it is helpful for diseases of the spleen.
And perform phlebotomy on him similarly as you have done on the other [person/side].
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and for the retention of menstrual flow, and for illnesses of old sores and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the method of phlebotomy for him is that the patient should put his foot in warm water and rub it until the veins appear well; and bind above the joint of the foot with a strap; and the location of the vein is apparent, usually below the little toe, and from there it is branched into many branches on the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize the largest branch below the leg, below the ankle, near its articulation, for it is better and more salutary.
And if you phlebotomize that [vein] on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are below it on the surface of the foot, and perform your phlebotomy so that you phlebotomize across, as if you wanted to incise it.
And let the phlebotomy be skillful.
But if the drawing of blood is prohibited; then immerse his foot in warm water and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs on the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, for the location is safe; and do not fear to harm him, but beware of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same to the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
And of the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, beneath the ankle bone on the inner side.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for him is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the method of his phlebotomy is that the patient enter a bath, and tightly bind his thigh from the hip to above the ankle with a long, thin bandage for four fingers' width, for it will not appear otherwise.
And then when it appears, then you phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you and according to the transverse, and that is better; or incise it by incision or cut it by section, because its location is safe.
And it is often very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch at all, then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the inside of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood flow that you desire.
Then loosen the binding and place a cotton pad over the phlebotomy site and bind the area tightly, for it heals easily.
Concerning cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and blood extraction, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping that is without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And the cupping glasses that are administered with scarification and blood extraction are applied to fourteen places of the body, of which one in which cupping glasses are placed is the occiput, and that is the back part of the head; and the middle of the neck on both sides together; and cupping glasses on the chin below the jaw, below the mouth; and cupping glasses on the two shoulder blades; and cupping glasses on the hypochondrium, and that is above the end of the ribs; and cupping glasses on the two flanks, and these are on the two sides; and cupping glasses on the two hips; and cupping glasses on the two thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of this it does not diminish the vital force in the same way as it does with phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity requires cupping for illness or for a continuous condition, we administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at any time.
Therefore, when you see any of these conditions, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we order that cupping be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it is applied, it relieves heaviness in the head and that which is settled in the eyes; but this should be done after evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not advisable to use it on one who is of cold constitution, or in whom there is a catarrh, for it causes great harm to such a person.
And therefore it is not advisable to use this on the elderly, and on those whose heads are afflicted with cold illnesses.
But to the one on whom this is continuously applied, forgetfulness is caused; and therefore you must instruct the cupper to place his hand slightly below the cupping area, fearing the production of forgetfulness.
But cupping with alkahel (likely referring to a specific substance or method) is in the place of phlebotomy of the dark vein (vena fusca) and the basilic vein: and therefore it benefits asthma, and the constriction of the throat, and the tearing of the throat's muscles, and cough, and fullness.
And it is necessary that the alkahel cupping be applied slightly higher, for if it is placed lower, it produces weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And cupping with alhagdahan (likely another specific substance or method) benefits accidental pains in the head and ophthalmia, and migraine, and suffocation, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to press his hand during scarification, lest he cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin benefits ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar oral diseases, and is in place of phlebotomy of the veins in the two lips (aliheric likely refers to the labial veins).
But cupping that is done over the two shoulder blades benefits caphatan (likely a specific ailment or symptom), which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping of the two inner parts of the ankles benefits as much as phlebotomy of three veins: that is, the basilic, median cubital (fusca likely refers to this, as it is a darker vein), and cephalic veins; because it draws blood from all those smaller veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed excessively in scarification, because the area is devoid of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cupping glass with which one cups over the buttocks, and it benefits hemorrhoids of the anus and deeper ulcers.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that it be a large cupping glass, and that it be of brass, because the location requires strong suction; and thin cupping glasses are quickly detached and should be scarified with scarification.
But cupping of the legs diminishes pain through manifest depletion, for they draw blood from the whole body, and benefit chronic pains of the joints and of the uterus, and of the bladder; and they provoke menstruation, and benefit boils and swellings; and they stand in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and of the two popliteal veins (alahorcoben likely refers to the popliteal space).
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause syncope in many men.
And of the popliteal cuppings, the benefit is similar to the benefit of cuppings of the two legs.
And the quality of the placement of the cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass initially empty and draw it by moderate suction, and do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them lightly, and remove them carefully, so that the humors come to the place by equal distribution. And do not cease to iterate this and continue until you see the place redden and swell and the redness of the blood appear.
And then you scarify and repeat the suction little by little, and consider the patient's constitution.
Because that man who is of tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once and no more, lest the place be ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to enlarge the scarification a little, and to moderate the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary that you scarify twice, for in the first time the way of thinning is opened to the blood and to its watery part. But in the second [scarification], to the thorough investigation acquired by the extraction of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then let a third scarification be made so that it achieves the desired outcome/effect.
Finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, one scarification is enough for us.
And if we want extraction of much blood, we make many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that we scarify with a deep scarification.
And the term "scarification" refers only to the depth of the incision.
And if the one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places for cupping be anointed with emollient, aperient, and resolvent ointments; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil, or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or blood oil, and similar ones.
And if the excess [humor] is thick and cold, then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balm mint oil, or aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
But if the patient has large pores and tender flesh, then the use of oil should be prohibited, and for such patients, the cupping sites should be washed with vinegar or cold water with henbane, or poppy water, or bordelais water, and similar things.
And he whose blood is of excessive humidity, wash his cupping sites with sour wine, or with myrtle and sumac water, and similar things.
And for the one whose superfluities are thick, wash his cupping sites with old wine, or with  water of self-heal (or sanicle), which is majoram, or a decoction of anise, or chamomile, and similar things.
And the cupping should be done before a bath; rather, it should be administered about an hour or two before the bath, and he should sleep after the cupping.
What is it that the person to be cupped or bled ought to observe before cupping?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the person to be cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp blood and inflammation, then he should take cooling things, such as sour pomegranates, and endive in sour wine, and lettuce, and dried borage, and julep, and similar things.
And give him foods such as poultry, and the meat of domestic birds, and foods seasoned with acids, and the like.
And for the one whose complexion is cold, he should drink syrup of almonds, or syrup of dried borage seeds, and sumac, and very fragrant wine between the months of November and December; and he should be advised to eat and drink sparingly, and give him foods such as poultry and hempseed and peas and small birds and doves.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, his drink should be greater than his food.
And it is necessary that at certain hours, some men be given theriac alpharac, or medicines of musk, that is, nutmeg, or theriac before cupping or before bloodletting or afterwards, so that the principal members are comforted and the blood is thinned; and they should not take those things hot.
But the cuppings that are without scarification should be cuppings that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen and gout, and on the navel, in the areas of the knees, and the urinary bladder, because these members do not tolerate scarification on themselves.
And it is not desired for those [members] except the drawing of blood from a member, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in the illness of a blood flow from the nose; and we use this so that cold, invisible windiness of the member is dissolved, just as we place it on the belly and navel; because this rarefies the member and warms it and reduces the pain because it resolves windiness.
And it is placed on the bronchi when they suffer from obstruction or swelling, for by virtue of strong attraction it easily opens the obstruction and removes the swelling from its place.
And similarly it acts when it is placed on the liver and spleen because of windiness enclosed within them.
And these cuppings are administered empty with suction alone; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and is larger; that is, with hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Method of cupping administered with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, according to how we have formed it; and the quantity of the depth be half a palm; and let it be on the side of him, in the place that is in the circumference, half of him, the hole be small according to the quantity that a needle enters into it.
Let it be made of bronze, copper, or citrus [possibly referring to a type of metal or alloy], with thick edges, smooth, even, and polished so that it does not injure the limb because of its placement on it.
And let there be in the middle of it a transverse bar of bronze or iron, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And now let this cupping glass be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses for infants and thin people are different from the cupping glasses for young people and those with large bodies.
And the manner of placing this cupping glass with fire on the limb is that you should extend the wick with a decent wood fire before a small wax candle, and place that on the middle of the transverse bar in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is lit around the area underneath, so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be on the hole that we have mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glass and do not need to remove the finger and the vapor escapes through that hole, then the cupping glass will immediately be detached.
And then ignite the wick according to its nature, and repeat this if you need to.
But a cupping glass that is used in the illness of pleurisy, with water, which has no transverse bar or hole, and is not used unless it is filled with water, and is placed on the limb only.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leech application is not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs where the application of cupping glasses is not possible, because of their small size, such as the fingers and gums and similar; or to a limb devoid of flesh, such as the fingers and nose and similar.
And the quality of using those leeches is that you have found leeches that are in clean, sweet waters of a stagnant pool.
And then they should be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and so that no matter remains in their bellies; and then the body should be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and cupping glasses; and then rub the patient's limb until it reddens; and then they should be applied to it.
And when they are full and fall off.
And if it is possible to draw blood from the area with a cupping glass, it is even more beneficial.
And if not, then wash the area with wine vinegar and then with lukewarm water; and it should be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged near the application of the leeches, and it is oozing, then you dip a linen cloth in cold water, and place that on top until the oozing is stopped.
And if the bleeding is excessive, then powder crushed vitriol, or gallnuts and similar styptic substances, over it until the bleeding stops; or  halves of roasted beans are placed on the area, and left until the beans adhere to the place, and the bleeding is stopped.
And it is necessary, if needed, to iterate the leeches, when it is possible to change them.
And if the leeches are prevented from attaching, then rub the area with fresh blood or prick the area with a needle until blood appears; and then apply them, because when they sense blood they immediately attach.
And when you want them to fall off, powder a little crushed aloes, or salt, or ash, on them, and they will immediately fall off.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: On Restoration. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
Oh, son, know that foolish physicians and the common people boast of this chapter, those who never looked at the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter of them.
And for this reason, the manner of the learned in our land is kept private; and I have never forgotten this at any time; and I have not acquired this knowledge except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and study of their understanding, until I extracted the science from them.
And I have applied myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
And I have described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and upon which my experience is based; since I have abridged it for you and freed it from lengthy occupation; and I have abridged it for the sake of brevity; and I have shown it for the sake of clarity; and I have formed in it many forms of instruments that are administered in it, as is done by way of added explanation, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
Summaries and collections concerning bone fractures, those which are necessary to preface before we begin the discussion of broken limbs and their various types. Therefore, I will say in the prologue of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters concerning the understanding of which, at the beginning, the artisan and practitioner must be grounded in the truth of these things; that is, you and those who are ready to know or learn this noble art other than yourselves.
Therefore I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall occurs to someone, then you must initially attend to it with phlebotomy or purging, or both together, unless some cause prohibits it, such as weakness of constitution, or if the one to whom it happened is a child, or an old person in decrepitude, or if it is a time of intense heat or intense cold.
And furthermore, let him be content with a diet of cold herbs and the flesh of birds and rabbits; and we prohibit rich meats and filling foods and all food that fills the veins with blood, until you are sure of a hot abscess, and if you do not fear an effusion of matter in the limb.
And then return the patient to their former regimen, with which they are accustomed.
And so, as the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient should be fed nutritious foods, thick, heavy, and viscous, such as foods made from wheat boiled in water, and rice, and heads [presumably heads of grain], and feet [likely animal feet], and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine, and similar things; and with this regimen, the consolidation of the fracture is made more lightly and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in their first youth and in the decrepit, cannot be rejoined and consolidated according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs.
However, nature adjusts and brings to the broken bone from every part some substance similar to glue, in which there is thickness that adheres and binds it until they are completely conjoined and bound together, until they reach the end of strength and firmness, like fire at the beginning, until some cause does not prohibit it from its work.
And for this reason it is necessary that you give the patient foods in which there is heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the bone of the foot is different from a fracture of the bone of the arm; and similarly all the other limbs are different from each other.
And I come with a remembrance of every type of fracture, explained in its own distinct chapter.
Many different kinds of fracture in themselves. And the types of bone fracture are diversified in themselves; for there is an arcuate fracture, besides those that happen in the stars; and sometimes a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of the sagitta (arrow) and stars and additions proceeding and not proceeding, just as it is done in the pen when it is prepared to write, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And to each type belongs its own appropriate remedy or treatment in its restoration, as will be its remembrance distinctly in its own place [chapter].
Many signs of bone fracture. And by this a bone fracture is known: its crookedness, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and that which we perceive when we compress it with the hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor is anything felt by your touch when you touch the bone with agitation and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
However, it is possible that there is a crookedness or small fissure, so it is not necessary that you move it with your hand and with complete compression; however, place upon it the medicines of which you will find mention near this point which is suitable for the place; and then let it be held tightly by a subtle bandage.
And know that if the place is curved and is not split in two, or another thing which does not happen to it as a result of being moved, as if the whole part were separated from its counterpart, then you should begin at your leisure to rectify it before an abscess occurs there.
And if a hot abscess occurs there, then leave it for some days until the abscess ceases; and then dress it according to whatever manner you can, with lightness and skill.
And know that the restoration and healing of it is easier than of a bone in which a wound has occurred.
And then bind it as the remedy for it suggests.
But if the bone is wounded, then extension of that broken limb is necessary from two sides, if it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two cords or with one cord and your hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb in a dressing according to its natural shape; while the parts of the broken limb are extended, then you must make those additions return to their places with skill and in whatever way you can.
And take care, according to your strength, that no pain or injury to the patient occurs through your operation; and strive to the best of your ability to apply one bone to its counterpart, according to their best fit.
And it is necessary that at that time you skillfully touch that with your hand, and if you see anything amiss there, rectify it and dress it to the best of your ability.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, as many foolish physicians do, who often cause a hot abscess by their operation, or cause a contraction in the limb, as we have seen happen through their operation many times.
And the quality of the binding of the quieted limb is that which I recommend; so that you know that broken limbs are diversified in their smallness and in their largeness and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the penis and similar to those, then the wrapping should be of very fine soft cloth.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, there should be a broad and firm wrapping, because the broad bandage connects the large limb and binds it on all sides with an even constriction, so that no blemish enters it.
Then begin, after your equalization evacuation, to place a bandage suitable for this, over the place of the fracture with three or four wrappings depending on what the limb requires; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
And then come with that to the most superior part of the fracture site, and tighten less than you did your binding with which you bound the fracture site. And then lengthen yourself with a wrapping of the fracture site a little, and soften the binding little by little, until you take from the site a large part.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with a wrapping, and then come with the wrappings to the lower part of the fracture; and let your operation in the tightening of the wrapping and in the softening of that be as we have said in the first wrapping above.
And then place between the layers of bandage linen or cloth with which the crookedness of the fracture is padded, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, do not place anything there.
And then place another bandage over it, and then bind over these bandages well-made splints immediately, if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the place, and then place on it that which dries the abscess and which reduces the inflammation; and leave that for some days; and then you tighten the splints over it.
And let the splints be of half a reed of smooth, wisely-formed cane; or let them be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint which is placed over the fracture be a little thicker and smoother than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to how much it is needed for the limb in size and smallness; and then tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then bind over it with thread decently as we have said of tightening, and it is so that your tightening should be greatest at the place of the fracture, and the farther it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen by the operation of some fools placing their threads of twisted rope, and it is a great error, when the tightening lacks equality.
And likewise, very fine threads are not convenient, because you will not be able to achieve with them what you want by tightening, and it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth between splint and splint.
And if the patient is harmed by the ends of the splints near the binding in those places, then place under those some carded flax or wool until it no longer causes him harm.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption occurs in the skin, and I will return with a discussion of that in the chapter according to its singularity.
And know that not every broken limb is bound with splints on the first day; the reason for this is that when the limb is large, it is not necessary to place splints on it until about five days or seven or more, according to your assurance of the advent of a hot abscess.
And this is the manner of the plasters with which the Ancients restored, which are placed on fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
A method of common plaster, a shortening of the restoration of fractures, suitable for many complexions and especially for women and children, because it is of that which neither heat nor cold overcomes: and it is that you take powdered mill dust, and this is the pith of the flour that falls from the movement of the millstone against the walls of the mill.
And make it thus as it is, except that you sift it with egg white, and make the confection of it neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of plaster restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take of asafoetida, of labdanum, of acacia, of elecampane, and wild pomegranate root, of each one dram; of myrrh and aloes, half a dram; of aloes wood, two drams; all should be crushed and sifted and mixed with aloe water or with egg white if the patient's complexion is warm; and then use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores lightly broken bones, and benefits many men.
Another method of plaster which benefits fractures and sprains: take wild pomegranate root and marshmallow root, one dram; of myrrh and aloes, half a dram; of acacia, six drams; of Armenian bole, two drams.
All should be crushed in a mortar with much grinding, and be sifted, and be mixed with water or with egg white and be administered.
A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and if pain occurs in those and in fissures and fractures: let soiled wool be taken and submerged in sour wine and boiled oil and be placed on the area.
But in this plaster there is no restorative virtue, it rather draws out hot abscesses and expels pain.
Another method of plaster that restores a broken bone: take fresh fig leaves and wild poppy leaves; pound everything and make a plaster from them.
A method of a brief plaster administered for the restoration of a bone fracture and when you want resolution of the remainder of an abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, and violet flowers,  pea flour, of each one part; let all be crushed and mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then mix that with moist coriander water or with water and use it.
Another method of a stronger plaster for resolution than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb: take roots of marshmallow and flaxseed, and pomegranate, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, of each one equal part; let all be crushed and mixed with willow water or with fresh water or with wine, all this according to the quality of the limb and the restoration of its color.
However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommends that it be of medium consistency between thickness and thinness.
But in Wales it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb during its restoration, and the substances which are drying with little heat are like myrrh, incense, and similar to those substances which we have mentioned.
Method for a plaster that helps with injury and pain: take millet, linseed, shaved human hair or bird down, and marshmallow, and salt, in equal parts; let them be crushed and sifted and mixed, and let a plaster be made.
But the amount of time the bandage should remain and when it should be loosened, is that you should consider if no pain or itching has occurred and the bone is not broken or dislocated; then you should not loosen it for many days. And if severe pain, itching, or inflammation occurs at the site, then you should carefully loosen or unbind it immediately, and remove the plaster.
And take linen cloth and a moist sea sponge, and submerge it in lukewarm water, and with it wash the area until the itching ceases and the pain is calmed; and then let the limb rest for an hour; and then place on it clean wool submerged in sour wine and oil or rose oil, and bind it on for a night until you are sure of a hot abscess, and that the inflammation of the limb is reduced, and its pain is eased.
And then repeat that subtle binding and small plaster, and do not tighten it as much as your first constriction, but refine it until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess, redness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms are completely reduced, and you judge that plaster and binding are necessary, then you should repeat it in the same way as you did at the beginning.
And if none of the conditions we have mentioned occur in the limb, then do not unbind it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days, depending on what appears to you upon unbinding the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and approaches the coagulation of the flesh upon it.
And then adjust the binding more tightly than in your first binding, and adjust it to the thickening of the patient's flesh, as the healing progresses.
But if you see the site of the fracture drying and thinning more than is appropriate, then you should know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it; and therefore, moisten it with lukewarm water every time you unbind it; and do this every three days; and loosen the binding a little, and through this operation, nourishment will flow to the limb, and it will heal easily.
But what foolish restorers of a fractured limb do, when it is not set correctly at the beginning, and is set crookedly, is a mistake according to their practice, and a great danger, and if it were right, the Ancients would have enlarged upon it in their books and would have worked with it.
And I have not seen anyone among them do this, wherefore it is more reasonable not to do it.
Chapter Two: On fractures when they occur in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are made by a blow from a sword, and the blow breaks the bone completely into pieces, which are below the bone, just as it happens in a tree trunk, and for this reason this type is called *ascial* (a type of fracture); or the sword cuts into a part of the bone, and cuts into the flesh but the incision does not pass to the back of it; and this type of fracture is called *levatio absoluta* (a type of fracture).
And the wound of these two fractures is either large or small, and of a fracture that is comminuted or attrited; and its cause is a blow with a blunt object or a fall on a stone, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the periosteum which is under the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the wound of these two fractures is either large or small.
And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone, as fine as a small hair, and for this reason this type is called a capillary fracture.
And there is a fracture that is made either by a fall or by a blow from a stone and the like, which causes some lamina of the bone to enter the inner parts, and is made in a concave place, just as happens to the thin plates of bronze when they receive a blow and a part of them is driven into the inner parts.
And this happens mostly in the bodies of moist bones, such as the skulls of infants.
And in all these types of comminuted fractures, the pieces are like separated stars. And I will bring everything back to its place with repositioning.
And we will know all these types of fractures by detection on those and by investigation of them with probes and removal of corrupted flesh that is on them.
And a hairline fracture is known because it is uncovered on the bone, and is cleaned, and we pass a probe over it, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of a fracture, consider the patient's symptoms first, and then if you see by the symptoms that it signifies by manifest signs of danger, such as vomiting of bile, and prostration, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and swelling of the eyes and redness of them, and similar symptoms in greater intensity, without doubt it is not healing.
And if you see no unusual symptoms, and you expect recovery, then you begin its treatment.
The reason is that if the wounded person has come to you at the beginning as wounded, and this is in the winter days, then you must study the setting of the bone before the fourteenth day, according to all conditions.
And if it is in the summer days, then you must attempt to set the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone is corrupted by the pus, and before the symptoms that we have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the membrane covering the brain, and is with small, ground-down pieces, then you must incise the comminuted and ground-down part, as I shall explain to you.
And so you shave the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone according to custom and manner as much as possible according to the shape of the wound, and that it is light on the patient.
And if you encounter, after the uncovering of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then you oppose it with what is necessary, and that is to fill the place with cloths soaked in rose-wine and oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess is settled and you are sure of the flow of blood; and then begin with the circling of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow incisor, and this is its shape:  And then use another incisor like this one, a little wider than that one; and this is its shape:
And then use yet wider incisors than the second.
And it is necessary that you have several different incisors, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others, and let their ends be sharp, and let them be of Indian or hardened iron.
And use them easily with percussion on the incisor so that you do not hit the head and injure it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary that you perforate its circumference before you use the incisors with the drills, which are called non-penetrating drills.
And they are not called so except because those do not reach the limit of the skull bone next to it, because the drill has a round end or edge on what is below its sharp head, similar to an edge or a small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of each bone, so that you have at your disposal for all parts of the skull a drill whose end is sharp, the length and shortness being according to the thickness of that part of the skull.
And this is the method for three types of drills:  The way to perforate the circumference of the broken bone is to place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated; then move the drill to another location, and place them so that the distance between each hole is the width of a finger or thereabouts.
Then incise with incisors what is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as possible in order to remove it easily, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument that you will have prepared for this, such as small pincers and forceps.
And you must take great care that the incisor does not touch anything in the brain.
Then, when you have encircled the bone by drilling, and it is separated from the brain if it is continuous with it, and you have extracted it, you must scrape and smooth its roughness and any remaining bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and finer than the other incisors.
And if any small, splintered bone fragments remain, then remove them easily with whatever instrument you have; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments that we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is easier, less frightening, which Galen and others praise highly; and this is his discourse: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin to uncover the part of the bone at the location where the fracture is most severe and most evident, until, when you have uncovered that part and have placed under it the tip of this slow and careful incisor, of which this is the form:
And it is such that the lenticular part is broad and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is divided into two edges lengthwise, like a saw; so that the lenticular part is applied to the brain with its surface, the sharp edge cutting into the bone.
Then strike the incisor on one side with a small mallet until you have incised all the bone easily as it is turned, and you are certain of the periosteum so that no accident occurs in any way, even if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, even if he were asleep.
Then, if any matter attached to the bone remains in some part of the bone, incise it with the lenticular end of that incisor, and remove it easily, for it is removed without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate the periosteum, and what is severed or removed from the bone is its surface, and roughness and small splinters remain, then you must shave off that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number, of different sizes, so that you may be able to use the most suitable ones in each place and the most appropriate of them according to the way you carry out your operation on that broken bone and its shape.
And you must use in your work with which you rasp the bone, at first the broadest of those rasps, and then use successively the finer ones, and do not cease to do this continuously until you come to using the finest and most delicate of all those.
But in all other small, hairline fractures and subtle fractures, you must administer treatment according to what you are doing to rectify them.
And it is a matter that is not hidden from all those who have studied this art. And this is what we have shown in writing concerning large fractures.
And if the panniculus (skin and subcutaneous tissue) is retracted when you reduce the bone, then you must take linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place that over the opening of the wound; and then take another folded or tripled cloth and immerse it in wine and rose oil and place that over the first cloth and do this as gently as you can, so that you do not press on the wound; and then apply a broad bandage over that, and do not bind it tightly but only enough to hold the wound in place.
And leave it with this treatment for one or two days until you are sure there is no hot abscess; and then unbind it and then apply medicines that draw out excess moisture, such as flaxseed, barley flour, and powder of henbane and birthwort, and similar things.
And it is that you make a powder of these medicines to be sprinkled on the wound, once they are dry; and in general, apply to it any medicine whose property it is to cleanse and not to bite (i.e., cause further irritation).
And take care, according to your skill, that the wound in your treatment be clean; and that there be no dirt from ointment or anything else; nor allow any virulence to gather there; for when it settles on the panniculus of the brain, it corrupts and poisons it, and from this, a malignant evil will befall the patient.
And it happens in the wound of the head, as the bone is cleaned and especially when its care is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, consider then if the accidents that we have mentioned befall the patient, know that it is perilous without a doubt.
And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine that is placed on top, and it is by the virtue of that medicine that this blackness is produced, then you should take one part honey and three parts of rose oil, and with these, moisten a cloth, and then place it over the wound; and then treat it with the appropriate healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken except in two parts together, or one of them sometimes, because in it there are two bones, for the lower part is cartilaginous, and it is not broken and nothing happens to it except abrasion, twisting, and contusion.
But if one of its two parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger into the nose, and you should adjust that fracture inside with your index finger, and with your thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with care, and be watchful that you do not cause the patient pain through your operation.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it should be set with the end of a rod which has a small thickness.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do likewise.
And strive for its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the seventh or tenth day you should treat the resulting abscess with cautery.
And then insert into the end of the nose a pledget of linen, if the fracture is in one part, or two pledgets, if the fracture is in two parts; and let the pledget be of such size that it fills the opening of the nose.
And I say that some of the ancient restorers said that the pledgets should be soaked in boiled oil and changed every day, but I have not seen this; rather, the pledget should be soaked in egg white mixed with powdered barley; and then leave the pledget until the bone is set and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a pledget, a goose feather, enveloped in linen cloth, is inserted into the nose; and let it be [done] when you have a more severe nasal fracture and the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this [use the feather], and if you wish, do [use] pledgets.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, plaster the nose with cerate or with cotton soaked in sour wine and rose oil, or with diachylon [plaster].
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then you should plaster that [the nose] externally with sesame flour and cooked lentil powder with egg white; and then place linen cloth over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted, then you should make an incision over them and extract them with instruments suitable for this; and then sew the incision, and treat it with that which incarnates and consolidates, and with plasters suitable for this.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then you should treat it with pledgets and administer lead canulae until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Concerning the restoration of the mandible when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and its fracture is without a wound, observe then if the fracture is only external, and is not broken in two and is bent inwards at the broken parts, then its recognition is easy.
And it is necessary, therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is in the left mandible, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with that the hump of the fracture inwards, easily towards the outer parts, with your other hand on the outer part of the bone; thus decently equalizing that.
And if the fracture of the mandible is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from both sides according to straightness until its equalization is possible.
And if there occurs concussion of teeth with disruption, then strengthen those which you hope will remain with gold or silver wire or silk; and then place over the broken mandible a cerate, and then place over it a doubled cloth, and place over the cloth a well-made large splint, or a piece of sole leather equal to the length of the mandible; and then bind that above according to how the binding is prepared for you and how the application is appropriate, until it is healed.
And command the patient to use rest and quiet, and give him sorbitive foods.
And if you estimate that the shape is already altered in some way, then you should examine it and unbind it on the third day; and then rectify what is already altered in it and plaster it with powdered millet, with egg white, or with bean flour, after you have removed the cerate, and place wool over the plaster.
And then, when this plaster is attached and adjusted over it, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not unbind it until it is healed and strengthens the fracture; for many times this fracture is healed in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its sedation until it is healed, and the abscess is resolved.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of bone is separated or splintered; then subtly remove those splinters with whatever is suitable for removing them from the wound.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then widen it with phlebotomy according to your need.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then sew the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters that is suitable for it and heals it, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken.
Often the clavicle is broken in the front part above the muscle, and this fracture is done in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is so that splinters occur in it, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is so that the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the aid and follows the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards that part.
Then align the fracture with your fingers until its shape is properly made, and there is neither a small prominence nor a concavity in it.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the armpit of the patient a roll of cloth or wool, and let its size be according to your need; and extend and elevate the clavicle and tighten the roll with your hand until you align the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the extremity of the clavicle to the outer parts, because it has reached the acromion, then the patient should be supine on their neck, and you should place a moderately sized cushion on their muscle.
And the assistant presses the muscle downwards until the bone of the clavicle which is on the acromion above is elevated, and then you rectify the fracture and align it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the clavicle and they are bothersome, then you should incise over it and extract those splinters easily.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you should carefully incise it with one of the scalpels which you have prepared for this, after having placed under the clavicle the instrument that serves as a support; and this instrument is of wood or iron, of which this is the form:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size of the bone or the smallness thereof.
But its length should be as long as is possible for you during the operation; that it has two ends like you see, and one end is wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and there is a risk of a hot abscess, then you should approximate the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's opening.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then dip a cloth in sour wine and rose oil and wine, and place it on that.
And ensure that the splint is not moved from over the broken bone; and for this reason you must see the patient each day, that when the ligature is softened or you see that the splint has been moved, then you rectify this and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's pillow under their neck, and place a small cushion under their shin at night on top of the pillow; so that with this the injured limb is raised, and thus the fractured clavicle is elevated by the muscle; or let their arm be tied to their neck.
And do not untie the bandage unless a boil or abscess occurs at the site, until twelve days have passed.
And then renew the plaster if you see the need, and adjust the bandage and restore it, and leave it until the fracture is healed and the clavicle is consolidated.
And it is strengthened and healed, depending on the case, in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some people it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is broken at its lateral point, and not shattered, only the edges [are broken].
And so when the point of it is broken—and it is broken in the middle of its point—and is only known by touch, then according to what the form of the fracture is, force the preparation of it and reduce it to its natural form in every way possible to you.
Then apply to the area a powder made from finely ground egg white and lion's wool; and then apply a powder of doubled cloth; and then apply to it a thin, smoothly-laid bandage of fine linen, according to the size of the whole shoulder blade or a little more.
But if the bandage leaves a cavity in any part of the shoulder blade, then you fill that cavity with lion's wool, and then tighten the bandage evenly.
And then bind it above with a long bandage, with decent constriction and firmness of the bandage until it is not moved from its place.
And examine the binding each day; and whenever it is loosened, bind it again and tighten it, and even out the bandage if it has moved from its place.
And lay the patient on his healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five.
And so when this number is complete, then you loosen the binding, and you should know for certain that this is of the bones whose beginning is not feared nor their dissolution.
And if it proceeds from the location of the collarbone and extends under the armpit, then you incise over it, and remove it, and proceed as we have said in the fracture of the clavicle, with cautery of the abscess if it occurs there.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of a fractured foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this heals slowly; but its extremities heal much faster because they are more compact and less fragmented.
And among the accidents of a fractured middle of the foot is that it inclines inwards, causing great pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, a strong fever, and vomiting blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is evident and not hidden from perception.
And its restoration is that the patient should be placed supine on his back, with a cushion placed between his shoulders; then press on his muscles, and adjust his bones with hands on both sides, and be careful in the operation and in the setting, in every way possible and appropriate, until the bone's shape is restored as it should be.
Then apply a plaster and lint, and over that place a splint of thin willow or alder wood, or something similar in lightness, after wrapping it in cloth; and be careful in binding it over the broken bone so that it is not too tight; and bind it in a circular manner around the back of the foot sometimes, and tighten it with a suitable binding; and check the binding frequently, and tighten it when it loosens.
And if necessity demands loosening of the bandage due to corrosion, itching, pain, or an abscess that develops in the area, then loosen and unbind it, remove the plaster, and rectify the problem with appropriate treatment; and reapply the plaster, if it is necessary; and adjust the binding until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs only happens in the thicker parts where there are two; and in their extremities in the front part, no injury happens to them except because they are cartilaginous. And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the feeling of its examination with the fingers.
And the restoration should be such that you equalize the fracture with your fingers as much as possible, until it is set as needed, and then plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if you need to do that.
And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the inner parts, then the patient suffers vehement pain and a stabbing sensation, like the stabbing pain that happens to someone with pleurisy, and because the bone pierces the membrane; and it causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And already the Ancients have devised many ingenious things for this.
And of them it is said: it is necessary that you give the patient foods that produce inflation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and extended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we would avoid this so that it does not lightly cause a hot abscess, if it does not happen; and if it already happens, then help with it.
And some of them say that a cupping glass should be placed on top and that it should draw strongly; and it seems reasonable, but however, it is feared that the cupping glass will draw superfluities to the place because of the weakness.
And some of them say: the place should be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is even as it envelops that roundness; and then the patient should be treated with a treatment for pleurisy with diet and medicine.
And if a vehement cause constricts the patient, which he does not suffer, and the bone pushes the skin with a painful puncture, threatening the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the place, uncover the broken rib, and then place over it an instrument that preserves the callus, the remembrance of which is mentioned before, and that we incise the bone easily, and extract it.
And then we adjust the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitching, and we treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then you should take and mix powders in rose oil and place it on the area, and the patient should be treated with what is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him be supine on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Chapter 9: On the restoration of fractures of the spine and neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and later leads to their attrition, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider: for if you see his hands already softened and numb and dead, and he cannot move them, nor extend nor flex them, and when you constrict them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and he feels no pain in them, then know that he is not healed, and in most cases this is mortal.
And if he moves them and feels constriction with the fingers and puncture, then know that the marrow of the bone is saved and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if he has something similar in the vertebrae of the neck and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then observe his feet.
Then if you see that they are already softened, the same thing has happened to them as happened to the hands, and moreover, when he lies on his back, he experiences flatulence and defecation without his will, and sometimes he lies on his back and wants to urinate and cannot, then know that it is mortal, and then do not work on his cure.
But if none of these things happen, the cause is better and milder.
And the cure for him is that you should, to calm the hot abscess, put on the affected vertebra plain rose oil, or with boiled egg yolks; apply this several times a day until the hot abscess is calmed.
And then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, and bind it tightly; and order the patient to rest and remain tranquil and not to sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed.
And if, due to the erosion of the bone, a splinter or something that has separated from it occurs, then you must saw it off at the bone and remove that bone; and then join the two edges of the wound with a suture if it is large; and then treat it with some incarnative ointment until it is healed.
But if the back of the hip bone is broken, and it is the end of the [hip] socket, then you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the anus, and with your other hand, set the broken bone as evenly as possible; and then apply a plaster and bandage, if you have them, and then bind it tightly.
And if you feel splinters broken inside, then you should make an incision there, and remove them, and treat the wound with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the hip.
The hip bones are rarely broken, and if they are broken, then their fracture is nothing but a separation at the extremities of those bones and they are split lengthwise and lean inwards; and the patient experiences pain and numbness at the location, and the leg is numb when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you bind that according to what is prepared for you by equal binding until it is similar to its natural form.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or inclines downwards, then you make the patient lie on their stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared by you. And then when you have bound it, place a plaster on it, and then place a splint of wood or whalebone over that, and bind it tightly so that you do not fear a puncture of the fracture or movement of the splint.
And bind the concavity with something that fills it until it takes the binding equally, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease the extension of it and its restoration until the hot abscess is calmed, and place on it that which calms it as is previously described; and then return to its restoration, and bind it as is necessary.
And if splinters occur in the bone or are comminuted, then you remove them.
Chapter 11.
On the restoration of a fracture of the clavicle (collarbone).
The clavicle is that which is between the shoulder and the neck.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a piece of wood of moderate thickness according to this form:
And let two bandages be tied at both ends, and then let it be suspended from a raised place.
And seat the patient on a stool; and then place his broken arm on the wood until it reaches his armpit, in the middle of which the curvature of the wood should be attached.
And then hang some heavy object from it, or let the assistant stretch it downwards; and then let the physician hold the fracture together with his hands until the fracture is properly reset.
And the other method is that the patient lies supine on his back and suspends his arm from his neck with a bandage; and then order two assistants, that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands; and the other hold the lower part; and each of them should extend to his part.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then tighten a bandage around the fracture, and another bandage over that, and let each of the two assistants extend towards their respective parts.
And so if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the armpit and the other below the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed on that place and on that elbow.
Swallow it easily and without difficulty, and then, when it is swallowed as it should be and is applied with good application, tighten it unless a hot abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day, and place on it soiled wool soaked in sour wine and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you tighten it.
And the manner of tightening it is that you place a plaster on the fracture, and then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm on that support, and place your open hand over its muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the arm on the support so that the arm is in a stellar position, unless some cause of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And it is that you place on the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is that your bandage over the fracture site should be tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be.
And so if you see the placement of the splints and the bandage as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper place, then you do so.
And if you fear a boil forming, then leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then examine the bandage in all parts for three days so that no itching or inflammation occurs at the site; or it is forbidden for food to reach the limb due to the tightness of the bandage; and then correct all this as we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not untie the bandage until three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place on the splint a poultice full of wool, evenly spread, and check every hour of the night and day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or dissolved, or that the bandage is not softened; therefore correct all this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order which we have previously mentioned, so that the food is light at the beginning until healing begins; and then it is appropriate to make their food thicker.
For it is customary for the splint and his leg to be bound for forty days; and then they should be unbound, and a bath should be administered, and it should be medicated with ointments which rectify that.
And if the fracture is badly crushed, then you should not unbind the bandage and splints before ten days or before two months.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two focils; of which one is small, and it is that which is next to the little finger, and the other is large and it is that which is placed below the little finger, on the lower side.  (Note: "focils" likely refers to the radius and ulna.)
And very easily the larger focil is broken alone, or the smaller one, and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small focil is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the focil is broken below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller focil above, then it is convenient for the physician, before its restoration, to apply slight extension easily until it is aligned.
But if it is the larger focil that is broken, then it is necessary to apply a more forceful extension.
And if both focils are broken together, then you must apply the extension much more strongly.
And it is necessary that you place the shape of your hand during its restoration and extension stretched out on a cushion, and let the thumb of the hand be in the upper parts, higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient be lying on a square cushion.
And let there be a cushion in front of him at his height or level, so that the patient does not suffer strain.
Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant extend it from above similarly.
Then the physician should align the bone until he reduces it according to the best configuration he can.
And if in the fracture of the bone there is a jagged edge, then you must forcefully reduce all the pieces to their place with your skill.
And if a separated, jagged piece appears which punctures the skin and there is no hope for its restoration, then you should saw it off and remove it according to the manner which we have described above.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already devoted a separate chapter to this, and therefore take the treatment from that.
And if an abscess occurs near the beginning of your restoration, then you should apply a cloth with a cerate made of rose oil and white wax, and let it be of medium consistency between thick and thin, and bind the cloth tightly over it with a thin bandage until the abscess subsides; and then remove the cerate and apply a plaster prepared from powdered millet with egg white, and then apply a compress; and let the compress which is placed over the fracture be thicker and firmer.
And know that the number of compresses on the arm varies in the major arrangements, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
Then apply your bandage over the fracture site firmly and forcefully, and wherever the bandage is closer to the parts above the fracture or to the parts below it, apply the bandage a little more loosely, as was previously mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist cloths, and not hard or rough, and the thread with which it is bound should be of a consistency midway between fine and thick, as we have already recommended.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any cause arises that requires rectification, such as itching that occurs in the limb, then you should bathe the limb with warm water until that itching ceases.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the fracture is now softened and the bone is reset and similar to the others, then rectify all this with your skill.
And further consider whether nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb by an overly tight bandage, for then you must loosen it a little and leave it so for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient does not experience any of the conditions we have mentioned, then the bandage should not be loosened for about twenty days or thereabouts.
Then the patient's hand should be suspended by its own agitated movement, and make the patient sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or very quickly in twenty-eight days, and all this depends on the constitution and the disposition of the [patient's] strength/vitality.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the little finger and of the fingers.
Know that the little finger and the knuckles of the fingers rarely suffer fracture, and what happens to them is mostly attrition (wear and tear).
And when a fracture or attrition happens to the hand, then it is necessary that the patient be seated and lie down before him evenly, and then place his hand upon that which is extended [i.e., the injured hand].
And then the assistant extends the broken bones, and the physician joins them until they are joined with a good union.
And then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, unless a hot abscess occurs; and then apply a bandage over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen.
But if the fracture is in the inner parts of the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball of cloth, and instruct the patient to hold it with his fractured palm; then it should be bound with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be of leather with cloth in which it is softened, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tighten it as necessary.
But if the fracture is in the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a bandage above and another bandage below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the splint, as the hand is rolled in a small cradle between the fingers with bandages.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be straightened as necessary and then bound to the palm; and if you wish, place a small straight splint on it so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or in the index finger, or in the ring finger, or in the little finger, then it should be straightened and tied to the finger next to it; or all should be tied together continuously, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your treatment, and regarding it, the disposition of hot abscesses and oppose — with your operation — that which is necessary when any of those conditions occur, as the description of them iterates.
Chapter 14.
On the treatment of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and is felt according to whether it is broken in the front or the back part.
And its treatment is done in this way: a bandage is tightened above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on their stomach and face.
Then the attendant stretches the entire bandage to its proper extent, according to the nature of the fracture, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is closer to the hip joint, then let the bandage be close to the knee on the side of the patella, so that the extension is upward, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the knee, then let the bandage be placed near the knee, and let the extension be towards the lower parts.
And then the doctor aligns the bone with both hands until it is reduced to its natural form and the bone is joined by a good union; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, unless an abscess occurs in the limb. But if an abscess occurs there, then you leave it for a few days until the abscess has matured and subsided, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be made thus: you must wrap a firm bandage around the fracture, and fold it two or three times, removing any excess; and then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the hip joint.
And insert a long piece of felt between the thigh and the leg near the knee on the lower parts, and let the ends of the felt come from the upper part of both sides, and then wrap around the leg and thigh whatever excess bandage remains.
And then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is secure.
Then begin with a firm bandage in the middle over the fracture site with three or four wraps, and the farther you move from the fracture site, the looser, lighter, and softer your bandage should be.
And then extend the two ends of the felt to the lower parts until it reaches the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage is not moved from its place.
And then leave the bandage on it, provided that it does not cause corrosion, hot abscess, swelling or anything similar to those in the limb; and if any of those things occur, then carefully loosen it, and rectify what happened as soon as possible, as we have said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone in the bone that protrudes, then you must reset it as best you can; and if not, cover it and keep it in place, and treat it with what was mentioned before until it heals.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is tightened even after splints have been applied, as we have said in the case of the arm and shoulder.
However, in the restoration done in this way, lameness does not occur to the patient; and if it is restored alone, without the other leg being applied to it, then it is necessary that he limps from that time on.
And know that the thigh is held tight for 40 days or a little more or a little less, and all this depends on the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
On the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap heals slowly, but it often causes attrition (or wearing away).
But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a wound, and everything about this is accompanied by sensation.
And its restoration is such that what is broken of its parts is joined together with said parts until it is aggregated and conjoined as much as possible by equalization, ease, and fabrication.
Then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you need one; and bind it above with a suitable bandage.
And then consider all the provisions which we have recommended in other fractures, such as hot poultices and similar things, so that all accidents are opposed with what is convenient for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the restoration of a leg fracture.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is thick and is called by the name of the tibia; and the other is thin and is called the fibula.
And the same kinds of fractures happen to these [two leg bones] as happen to the two bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is the same.
And if the two bones are broken together, the leg is deformed in all parts.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is deformed in the front parts.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it below, and it is one of those things that are not easily managed.
Then administer extension, reduction (setting), and ligation of the splints according to that method.
However, if the leg fracture is large with many splinters, the extension should be less and gentler, and relieve it with your skill.
And in the leg, there is a certain procedure similar to that for the arm.  When you have set the splints and completed your operation, then you will take pieces of pine wood which are placed under the bandages that are placed on the splints and are made of palm branches; choose those of small thickness and not the thin ones, and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the ankle.
Then wrap each one in two cloths according to its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side, and they should extend from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then tie the two splints in three places: at the two ends and in the middle. For with this construction the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and remains in a good position.
And now a small wooden splint, according to the length of the leg, is applied; and let the leg be placed on it so that it preserves its position.
And especially it is necessary that you do this in a fracture, and when there is a wound specifically.
And then examine the leg each day and study it carefully, and watch it for abscesses and inflammation or other similar conditions; and if any of these conditions occur, then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the talus and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the whole talus does not often occur; but fractures of the bones of the foot do occur sometimes; and fractures of the toes occur rarely, and they only suffer attrition in cases of injury.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and sometimes those bones are elevated above each other, then the patient should place his foot on the ground prepared as previously described.
Then place one foot on the elevated part of those bones, and then press and manipulate them until they return to their places.
Then apply a plaster and lint on top, and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two flat ends.
Then bind that with the foot with a descending bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other necessary things.
And when three or four days have passed, then untie the bandage, for you will find the bones set, whether they were fractured or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if some say they are fractured, then restore them and manipulate them as I have recounted to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place a splint on the fractured finger according to its length, and let it be a little longer than it; and place under the foot that board which I have described to you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
But if what is fractured of the bones is two or three or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its size wrapped in linen cloth, and bind the board to the lowest part of the foot, and let it rest on one of the ends of the board, outside the sole of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
And it is convenient for you that you not forget that you consider all the things that I have told you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose yourself to every accident with what is appropriate.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the woman's hip and of the pubic bone and of the man's penis.
When the hip of a woman is fractured, then make her lie down in a reclining position, and gently incline her to one side, and she should be supported from behind.
And then the midwife fills the hip with cotton, and it should be made into a ball in her hip; and then the woman should be bandaged, and her hip raised little by little, for all this is dislocated until the part of the hip is brought back into place like a ball and the broken bone is set.
And then apply powders to her hip, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and then she urinates, and reposition and return it according to the method by which you set it initially, and then return it to its first position.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it will be healed.
And if you wish, take a pig's bladder and attach a reed tube to its opening; and insert the whole bladder into her hip, and then inflate it through the tube until the bladder is inflated inside the hip, for this will help the fracture to reset.
And then it should be filled with cotton and remain so for some days as we have recommended, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the pubis of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and healing that which we have recommended for the hip bone.
And that which is right is not hidden in these nearby fractures which happen infrequently, especially to one who studies and uses and understands this my book well; for that fracture shows you the best methods in its restoration and binding, and therefore understand well.
But in the case of a broken penis, take the gum of a gooseberry, and place the penis in it; and then place a cloth bandage over it, and let it be wrapped, and then let it remain for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractured bones when there is a wound.
It is convenient for one who suffers a fracture with a wound, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar, that you take care of and bleed him immediately if the conditions for bloodletting testify to this as we have said above.
And if the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary that you attend to stopping it such that you sprinkle crushed egg whites on it, if no other cause is present.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not prolong it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, uncovered, then it is necessary that you carefully reduce it and align it with your hands easily and with little extension.
But if extension is not prepared for you and the alignment of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands with this instrument; and it is an instrument which is made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight fingers, and the width of which is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of these, according to the quantity needed for it in the treatment in every kind of fracture.
And let it be round, and let it be of little thickness so that it is not bent by the compression on it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp end which has a margin at its ends; and let the upper part of it be of a tapering thickness, and from the middle of it to the ends.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem," that is, a small spatula.
Therefore it is necessary that its sharp end be placed raised above the end of the prominent bone.
And push that in at once until the bone returns, and let it be equalized with some instrument.
And then strive to equalize the ends of the fracture between them, and if the broken end of the bone is thin, and does not receive the instrument well, then it is necessary that you incise the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recommended, then incise it with whatever is suitable from the incisors which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient finds vehement, persistent pain, then know that the bone is not returned to its natural place; and then do what you can to provide great relief to the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete, then submerge a cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption there.
And then administer stitches at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you may incise the opening with forceps and use dressings according to the size of the wound.
And guard yourself with all caution that you do not constrict the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish physicians have done this, and caused death or corrosive illness, that is, gangrene, upon their patients. And if your stricture is light, soften it, differently from the stricture of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have recounted, and you find pain in the place, then it is not fitting that you place stitches there, but apply a dressing of firm cloths instead of stitches and bind it with those.
And when, after a day or two, the wound begins to generate pus, then remove the cloth which you had placed upon it with wine, and then administer poultices, ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar things.
And it behooves you to unbind the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and closed, and it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows downwards easily.
If many days pass and the wound is neither consolidated nor is the pus discharged from it, then know that here there are collections of small particles, for which it is necessary to explore the wound with a probe. And of those collections, remove and extract those which are separated; those which are not separated and press upon the limb and cause pain, you must incise as far as is possible for you.
And if there happens to be swelling or inflammation in the wound—that is, *stiomenios*—or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary that you treat each of those things with what is appropriate, the treatment of which is described in its chapter.
And this is what my discourse should address, and you should pay attention: when a large bone is fractured, such as the bone of the thigh or the humerus and similar large limb bones, and there is no traction or extraction of it, for many times death ensues from this; therefore leave it until it suppurates, for it will soon fall away by itself after twenty or thirty days; and then treat the wound if it seems right to you, and if not leave it.
Chapter 20.
Chapter 20: On the treatment of the swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.
Often this swelling occurs at the site of a healing fracture, especially near the joints, and it distorts the shape of the limb; and it quickly prevents the limb from its natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and apply to it medicines that are styptic, such as aloe, incense, myrrh, cerecloth, and acacia, and similar ones; so that you take some or all of these, and mix them with styptic wine, or with egg white, or with sour wine, and apply this to the swelling on a pledget, and bind it firmly in place.
And leave the bandage tight; do not loosen it for many days; then loosen it and apply another, until the swelling is reduced; or bind a thin sheet of lead over it, because lead has the property of reducing anything that is swollen in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already become hardened and constricted, and necessity compels its removal carefully, then incise it in its most superior part, and incise the superfluous and prominent part, or scrape it with some instrument until it is reduced; and treat this until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Chapter 21: Of the restoration of a fracture, when it is restored and the limb remains thin and weak, not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is set, and the limb remains thin and weak, this happens for many reasons: one of which is excessive loosening of the ligaments and their binding not as it should be; or by excessive tightness of the bandages, such that nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb; or by excessive and superfluous embrocation; or by excessive movement not at the proper time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the cure for this is to give the patient nourishing food and to make his heart cheerful so that his blood is multiplied; and administer baths; and instill joy and happiness in him.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continue embrocation with warm water until nourishment flows and returns it to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Chapter 22. Of the treatment of fractured bones when they are set crookedly and the proper operation is prevented.
When, after a limb has been set, there is a return of crookedness and swelling at the fractured bone and joint, and because of this the limb is deformed, but the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not accept the word of someone who believes that limb is newly fractured.
But there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land; and this operation is very reprehensible, leading to great fear, the sign of which is mortal.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed with tepid water in which are boiled softening herbs, such as mallow leaves and roots, melilot, and similar things; and a softening plaster should be applied, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of mallow root should be made and mixed with white clay or with oil of chamomile, and applied as a plaster; or ripe figs should be crushed with pigeon droppings, and similar things from among the medicines called consolidating emollients.
And sometimes it is resolved with gentle, frequent rubbing with moist hands, and movement of the limb in every direction should be administered at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become severe and hardened, and there is need to treat it with iron, then the overlying skin should be incised and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and that which superfluously swells with the bone should be cut away with fine scalpels, and relief should be provided with care and attention.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the discourse on dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of one of the joints from its place, wherefore movement is prevented, and the shape of the limb is distorted, causing great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, it is necessary to immediately strive for its reduction, and not delay that reduction, for if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and very quickly the reduction of the dislocation becomes difficult.
And for this reason, it should not be moved or stretched at the time of inflammation, because many times it causes spasms and intense pain.
But when this happens, then you should attend to the phlebotomy of the patient, and allow it until the inflammation subsides; and then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated in such a way that it will return to its proper place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what preceded on fracture; from the uppermost part of the body down to the lowermost part.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are moved from their places by slight movement, and are softened a little; or they are dislocated by complete and full dislocation, to the extent that they are softened at the joint, until saliva flows from the patient and they cannot retain it nor close their mouth, and their tongue is entangled in their speech.
But when the dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete and full, then it is necessary that reduction be administered lightly, and not delayed at all.
And it is that the assistant holds the head of the patient, and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocation of the jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he inserts both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands are outside with which he pulls; and he commands the patient to relax their jaws and allow them to move from each side; and the physician pulls the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer a vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easy and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And when they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place on those powders of cloth with cerate, and let it be made of wax and rose oil; and then it should be tied easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head should be between two pillows, so that it does not hurt on the right or left side; and do not force them to chew anything; before their food should be very soft, until when the pains are lessened and the jaws are healed, then let them eat what they want.
And this should be administered easily, and do not work on opening the mouth during eating and drinking and speaking, until the jaw is healed and healthy.
And if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and are not returned to their places, then many times fevers and persistent thirst occur, and the patient's abdomen is quickly bloated, and they quickly vomit pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is dangerous; and many times the one to whom this happens dies within a few days.
Chapter 25.
On the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and the extremity of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated inwards by its connection with the ribs; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is evident to the touch.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. Then compress the area with your palm with firm compression, for it will return.
Then apply a plaster and powders to that area and bind it tightly.
But the extremity of that which is the elbow and is continuous with it, is not dislocated in any way; then it must be reduced and bandaged as we have said and as is appropriate for you.
Then apply a plaster, powders, and a bandage to it, and instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until it is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that a muscle is dislocated in only three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated to the upper part of the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated to the back parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the front parts by the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and protrudes from the lower parts below the nipple, and especially in those who have little flesh, it is easily dislocated; but in those who have much flesh, it protrudes with difficulty.
And it quickly happens to some men through a blow or fall, and their muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is thought to be dislocated because of this.
Then you must prove this before you are completely certain of it, and then you proceed with its cure.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts below the nipple; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, because you find a manifest difference between them; and you find in the head of the muscle a concavity, and below the nipple, near the touch of the head of the muscle, like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
If it is dislocated near the feet or above, and you then find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easily done when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises his hand to the upper parts; and then places his hands below his nipple, and raises the joint strongly up to its place, and the minister raises his hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it below because it returns easily.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and from the beginning that the dislocation happened, many days have passed, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water and an emollient and softening embrocation be administered, such as cooked roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered.
And then the patient should lie supine on his back and a wool cushion be placed under his nipple, which should be of a consistency between softness and firmness, and then the physician should place his heel on the cushion, and raise the head of the muscle with force, and pull the patient's hand so that it is not pulled downwards, and another minister should hold the patient's head so that it is not pulled downwards, because it immediately returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method:  that you have a man present who is taller than the patient, and he stands on that side, and inserts his arm under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the patient's hand from under his belly. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down, because the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reduced easily according to another method: that a long pole be fixed in the earth, the head of which is round in shape, like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, and then it is placed under the patient; after cloths are placed on top of the pole, and the patient stands along the length of the pole, and then his hand is extended downwards on the other side; and his body is pulled strongly from the other side, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if its reduction is difficult for all the reasons we have mentioned, then use this treatment: that you take a pole whose length is two arm-lengths, and its width is four fingers, and its thickness is reduced at the end near the armpit in this shape:
And then, on the round head, soft cloths should be tied so that the pole does not injure the patient.
And then it is placed under the armpit of the patient, and the hand or arm is extended over the pole down to the lower parts, and the pole is tied above the shoulder and arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a step of a ladder according to its width, and the hand is extended to the lower parts, and the rest of the body is suspended from the other side, for the joint enters immediately.
And when its entry is complete in whichever way is possible for you, then you should place under the armpit a ball of wool of equal quantity; and then apply a plaster prepared from powdered mollium [likely a softening agent] and egg white over all the muscle, so that it is wrapped around, and then tighten under the armpit with a decent bandage; and the bandage should be wrapped over the plaster, and the patient's hand should be attached to their neck, and left, and the patient's hand should not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's diet be meager until the limb is strengthened, for it is easier for its healing.
And then the diet should be increased after seven or five days, and some movement should be exercised; and then if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity that affects it or another cause, then a cautery with three holes should be administered to it, as previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is untied and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and the bandage are reapplied several times, and it is not firm and falls and cannot raise that arm to the upper parts, then know that its nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are incised or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Of the dislocation that is made between the foot and the ankle or the back parts, the reduction is made with impulse and extension with the hands, until it returns [to its place].
And let another bandage be applied to it, and treat it until it is healed.
And if during the healing process heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement occur, then let the patient use a bath many times until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its former nature.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the treatment of a hip dislocation.
Know that the hip joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and more so to the front than to the back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is evident to the sight or to the touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated. And when you align the dislocated hip with the healthy one, this is clearly evident to you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the leg, nor touch with it its own muscle (thigh).
And it is necessary that you attend to it, and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess develops, for if a hot abscess develops, its reduction is difficult, and it is not easily completely healed; and especially when it is in the posterior parts, for it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and more painful, and often death results from it.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's leg should be extended with two hands, and their thigh should be expanded, and the doctor's hands should be above and below the hip, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front, then return it by bending the leg with your hand, until you strike the hip with the base of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous and very strong extension.
And it is so that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it firmly so that it is not moved during the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, after it has been wrapped with a long, folded cloth over the patient's hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that this may aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease; and then push the joint with strong pressure until it returns to place.
And after the reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be applied which possesses styptic and drying properties with egg white, and it should be tightly bound with a descending bandage, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left thus for some days.
And afterwards it should be unbound; and then if the joint is set in its place, then you untie its bandage and leave it.
And if you see that the joint is not well-knit, then you should reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it for some days until it is firm; and afterwards unbind it.
But if  severe pain occurs during the reduction of the joint, and the patient's condition is agitated, then administer moist heat in a bath and gentle friction, and compression, until relief is obtained; or apply a poultice of marshmallow, that is, something very fatty; and then bandage it, and leave it on the bone day and night. And afterwards remove it, and place it in a bath; and when it is sufficiently softened, then rub the joint with a temperate friction, and afterwards reapply the marshmallow, that is, a very soft poultice, once, and a second time, and a third. with the application of a bath, until it is calmed.
And if you wish, place over it a moist and warmed ox-hide, bound tightly over it; and do this several times, because it is moist and restores it to its proper state.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated wrist, that is, of the joint that is between the arm and the hand.
A dislocated wrist is sometimes easily reduced, unlike other joints; however, speed in reduction is necessary at the time of dislocation, before the area becomes inflamed or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's wrist joint on a table, and the assistant extends the patient's hand, and the physician places his hand or palm over the prominence of the joint, and manipulates it until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered whether the palm is already facing the belly of the hand; then the patient places the back of his hand on a table during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then the position of the patient's hand should be inward on the table, so that the physician's hand rests on that prominence of the joint.
And so if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then compress it with a poultice to reduce the inflammation and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, you will not be able to reduce it once several days have passed.
However, if the joint remains crooked and the patient experiences no pain other than a weakened hand unable to grasp anything, then you should know that the nerves are pinched or crushed. In this case, there is no remedy except to cauterize near the affected area, and quickly apply a bandage.
Then, once the limb is set, apply the poultice we have described, and let it remain compressed for five days; afterwards, unbind it and let the patient's hand be exercised.
But if movement is restricted and some swelling occurs, then soothe it with warm water and massage several times until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes fingers are dislocated in every direction/part.
And when a finger is dislocated towards the back of the palm or the belly of the hand, then extend the finger and reduce the dislocation with your hands until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it downwards from the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened on that same day.
And when night comes, bind it according to that method, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for some days until it is tight/strong.
And do similarly if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform your first operation until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter 30.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation happens to any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are dislodged from their places, then in that case there is no cure, for death threatens the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excrement is expelled involuntarily, and they cannot retain it; and many times some of their limbs are weakened, or both legs, or both arms, or one of these; or one vertebra is dislodged from its place, because many times it is dislodged and many times the displacement of these happens in four parts.
Therefore, that is already dislodged to the rear parts and is called yellowness (jaundice, or possibly referring to a discoloration).
But the cure for him is that then you consider if the yellowness (jaundice) comes from purulence (pus), because then in that case there is no cure, nor is there any healing at all.
But in that which comes from a fall or from a blow or similar to those, the Ancients already described the methods of cure with extensive discourse, of which the most returns with profit; but I have already abbreviated that, whose brevity excuses the excess of it, because of my proximity to my intention in my exposition, with which I have exposed and formulated this from various instruments of that with which I will show this and expound that.
And of those, only that which occurs in the two (presumably referring to specific body parts mentioned earlier) properly is cured with what I recounted.
And it is that the patient should be extended on his face on a suitable, flat surface near a wall, and a soft underlayment should be placed under him so that his feet are not pressed.
And then a straight pole should be placed, fixed in the earth at the head end of the bed near the patient's head, and another pole at the foot end of the bed near his feet.
And the attendant should hold the pole, and it should not be fixed in a pit; and another attendant should hold the other in the same manner.
Then wrap a strong linen bandage around the patient's head and below the ears; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole which is by his head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage around his hips, thighs, and legs; and then fasten all the bandages and tie them to the other pole which is by his feet.
Then each attendant should extend the bandages to the poles, and the two poles and the bandages should not be removed from their places where they are fixed, but nevertheless, they should not be fixed as we have said [previously - implying a level of tension and adjustability].
And the physician should place his palms on the spine with firmness until it returns [to its proper position], or place a board on it, and then adjust his feet on the board until it returns [to its proper position].
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board whose width or length is about three braccia, and make a hole in the wall which we have said is near the patient, into which the end of the board fits. Then place half of the board on the spine, and the physician place his feet on the other end, and press firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you wish, use a lathe which is turned by hand; and you should place in the ground near the patient's head, at the back of the neck, two poles, the length of each being one arm's length, and similarly two poles near the patient's head, at the back of the neck; and the distance between each pole should be one palm, and a hole should be made in each pole through which the lathe passes, and each should be firmly fixed in the ground so that it is not moved.
And there should be a round pole on which the lathe is mounted, and it should be rotated in the two holes of the two poles.
And at its end is a hole in which the pole is fitted, the length of which is one palm, together with that which is rotated; and the other two poles are similar to that one.
Then tighten the bandages that you have tied around the patient's feet at the hole which is near their head, and the bandages that you have tied around their thighs at the lathe which is near their feet.
And then near each lathe there should be a minister who turns the lathe with his hand, and the physician manipulates the vertebra as we have said.
Then, once the vertebra is returned and the area is manipulated, you should apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then lint; and then place over the plaster a piece of linen cloth whose width is three fingers or thereabouts, and whose length is sufficient to cover the area of the swelling, and the part of the healthy vertebra.
Then it should be bound with the bandage that we have mentioned, and the patient should be given light nourishment until they are healed.
And if any swelling remains in the area at the end of healing, then medicines should be administered that soften and smooth, with the application of the linen cloth for a long time, which we have recommended; and a lead plate is applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the back of the spinal vertebrae, and it is caused by that dislocation; and that is a bone that already swells, so that no attempt should be made to treat it with this medicine, for it will quickly cause death.
Chapter 31.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint suffer only dislocation, and that does not happen to them which happens to other joints of small movement and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards.
And a sign of its inward dislocation is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg is longer and the knee more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot without pain, and it is in that place that the pain is often inflamed with a hot abscess, because the head of the femur has already reached there.
And the sign of that to which dislocation happens outwards, is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And the sign of that to which dislocation happens forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but nevertheless cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he forces himself to walk he cannot do so on the front part; and his urine is retained and his groin is inflamed, and he walks on his heel.
And the sign of that to which dislocation happens backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the hip, and his leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is in that place.
But reduction of the types of this dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and longstanding, that it is already set with having that nearby you administer its reduction and it remains according to its disposition, then it is not in that cure of everything; and therefore it is not fitting that in that case a presumption should be made.
But in the case of one whose dislocation is recent, and is one of the four types of dislocation, then attend to this that you return the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, for it quickly returns and does not need other treatment.
But, if it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part, either with his hands, or with a bandage which is tied above the knee; and another assistant extend the hand of that one from above so that he places his hands below the testicles; and then tighten with a strong bandage on the head of the femur, and let another assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be from him or from the inside part to the groin towards the part of the fork (presumably the pubic region), or from the back part to the part of the back.
And let the extension of all those be at once until the patient is lifted with his body from the earth and remains suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four (types of dislocation).
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type that which we shall say of its proper cure.
In the reduction of the hip itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is in the inward parts, it is necessary that the patient lie supine on his sound side; and then place the ligatures on the root of the thigh in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the place which is below the groin; and then extend the ligature upward from the part of the groin to the highest part of the fork (pubic region).
And then another strong assistant grasps his arms, and presses the thick part of the affected thigh and extends it outwards with a strong extension, because then it returns to its place.
And this type is of easier cure, with which this limb is reduced, than the other types.
But if it is difficult for you and you do not succeed with this type of cure at all, then it is necessary that the patient's two feet be tied together with a strong, light ligature, above both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each part be the quantity of four digits, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two digits.
And then the patient should be suspended from the head of the beam, and let him be in the house; and let his height from the ground be the quantity of two arms' lengths.
And then command a strong young man to reduce the head of the thigh, and let another young man support the patient, and the other young man, reducing the thigh with strong pushes, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the patient lie on his back as we have recommended in the case of the yellow fever; and let the ligature be tightened around the affected leg properly and around his feet.
And then two beams should be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head; and then let adjusted beams be placed in the middle of the elevation on which wet cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the beam is between his thighs, so that during the extension to the lower parts it is not pulled.
And then each attendant should extend on his side, and the physician with his hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and it is according to this same narrative on an elevation; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the dislocated joint of the patient, and then grasps it with the other hand, and with that grasp places that [leg] extended to the lower parts at the part of the knee.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended to the lower parts, and it is elevated above the earth; rather it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary for the elevation if his hip is dislocated to the outside parts, according to what we have said of his lying on two hips; and it is on his face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, there is hardly any [harm].
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a cloth on the place where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as it should be — and the sign of his reduction is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see those equal and the patient flexes his leg and extends it without difficulty, then know that the limb is returned as it should be — and then you adjust the two thighs and apply a plaster and bind it tightly so that the hip is not moved in any of the parts; and let the patient rest for three or four days.
And then untie the bandage and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then know that the dislocation is now healed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause for softening (or loosening), then you return and plaster that, and bind it according to your first binding, and leave it for three days.
And then untie it, and have him delay ambulation (walking) for some days, until it is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated to the outside parts, and to the inside parts, and to the lower parts, more to the back parts; and to the front parts it is not dislocated.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply his leg to his thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its types is that you make the patient lie down straight, so that he extends his leg, if he can do so; adhere your two hands to his face, and place his foot between your feet; and then make the patient's knee adhere to your palms, and hold those between your fingers over his knee with strength, and another attendant extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that his leg adheres to the thigh with light, painless ease.
And then plaster that and make the leg adhere to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for some days, until he is healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction is difficult for you, then administer strong extension with bandages, the use of which in the treatment of the hip was described previously.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the talus. (Talus refers to the ankle bone)
The talus is sometimes dislocated by a slight movement, and sometimes completely dislocated; and its dislocation is either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the talus swells, extending towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its slight displacement is gentle reduction, and that is to extend it easily with the hands and to manipulate it until it returns to its place.
But in the treatment of it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient lie straight, and that a strong and capable assistant hold him from behind, at the level of his back.
And then you, with your right hand, grasp the foot from the upper part, and with your left hand, from the lower part of the foot at the ankle.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left hand, twice, and then extend with the left; and push the bones of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice, as we have described.
And then push the bones of the foot to the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
Then it returns in one or two attempts according to this method, and if you see the foot set correctly, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, for it will return.
But if the reduction by the method we have described is forbidden to you, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and tie a strong rope firmly to the ground, so that it lies between his thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around him so that it does not hurt the patient.
And then let his attendant hold his thighs, and then another attendant extend the foot with his hands or with a bandage that he ties around the ankle; and then let each attendant extend against the extension of his opposite number, and the rope should be between the patient's thighs, holding it, so that his body is not pulled down from his extension.
And then the doctor sets the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh downwards, because the dislocation returns easily.
And so when the dislocation is reduced and the success of the reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with bandages.
And it is necessary that you fear or guard against the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage on it is not tight and does not strongly injure them.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is loosened, tighten it.
And then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be loosened and worsened, and then it will not receive a cure.
And if a hot abscess happens to him, then it is necessary that you administer to its suppuration that which precedes our narration, in another place of treatment and application, until it is healed.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocations of the toes.
It is necessary that the one who is dislocated be bandaged with slight extension without effort; and this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
But if the dislocation is in some of the bones of the instep, then it is necessary that you make the patient place his foot on the ground or on a table, and remain like that as if he were walking.
And then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from the joints, and then press that with your foot with force until it returns, and you see that it is already set and no prominence appears in the place.
And then place under the sole of his foot a board that covers the whole foot, to which are attached two ends, and then bind it with a decent and firm bandage for three days; and then untie it and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and its restoration is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that are made with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When any of these causes occurs, and you engage in its cure and restoration, death often ensues.
And therefore it is not fitting that one should presume to treat it, except one who is wise in the art, of long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not rash or presumptuous; and who uses at the beginning only such medicines as reduce hot abscesses, and leaves the patient to divine judgment, except for him in whom you see hope of recovery, with alleviation of the disease, and in whom some hope appears. And then strive immediately to reduce it at the beginning of the cause, before a hot abscess develops.
And then if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regime which reduces hot abscesses and treat the wound with what is suitable, of drying ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and the jagged ends of the bone are separated, then you must bind them firmly together, and do in this as we have said in simple diseases, which has been preceded in those places.
And guard and avoid, according to your ability, that entry into paths of fear as my preaching has preceded for you; for that is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and more wholesome for your true body in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
