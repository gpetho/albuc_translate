On the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from inside the head.	On the treatment of tears and defluxions in the eyes arising from within the head.	0.8747674
When someone experiences copious, sharp, pungent, and persistent discharges, and you see their eyes weakened and small, their vision impaired, their eyelids ulcerated, and their eyelashes falling out. And there is a sharp, painful ache deep in the head, and continuous sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from numerous, deep vessels, and the best treatment for them is this treatment:  You order the patient to shave his forehead, then you make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.	When anyone has a quantity of painful defluxions, acrid and continuous, and you see the eyes wasted and sunken and their sight is weakened and the eyelids are ulcerated and lose their eyelashes; while deep in the head there may be a vehement and grievous pain with incessant sneezing, then you may know from these occurrences that those humours and catarrhs arise from many deep blood-vessels.	0.841843
And there is a sharp, painful ache deep in the head, and continuous sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from numerous, deep vessels, and the best treatment for them is this treatment:  You order the patient to shave his forehead, then you make a single incision in the middle of the forehead. Or slightly higher horizontally, and you begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and the incision should reach the bone. Keep your hand away from the temple muscles that move during chewing until the bone is exposed and you have dried all the blood with a sponge.	The best treatment in this case is that which follows: you bid the patient shave his forehead; then you make one incision in the middle of his forehead or a little above, crosswise (begin the incision from the left temple going toward the right temple; the incision should be down to bone; and avoid the temporal muscles that move during mastication) until the bone is laid bare.	0.6695297
Then separate the edges of the incision with absorbent cotton or a linen wick, then bandage over it with compresses soaked in wine and oil to prevent a hot swelling. When you remove the bandage and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should scrape the bone until the flesh begins to grow in it.	Wipe away all the blood with a sponge and separate the edges of the incision with teased-out cotton wool or with rolls of linen; then bind up with pads over; the pads should be soaked in wine and oil to guard against an effusion. When you undo it, if you see that an effusion has erupted, you should scrape the bone until a growth of flesh begins in it; then treat with a drying treatment which generates flesh.	0.8487843
Then treat it with the drying method that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, preparing an ointment from them, and using it for flesh growth in such wounds.	For example, two parts of wheat flour are taken and of colophonia four parts, and of them a salve is made which may be used to encourage the growth of flesh in wounds of this sort.	0.82216525
