of the abscess of the testicles
This is an abscess enveloped in an envelope similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he walks; and the treatment of this disease is almost as daunting as the one before, and yet we will tell you the procedure for it, according to what the ancients did.
You must have the patient sit on a raised seat, then lower the suspensory of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels that are near the penis, and have the assistant hold them and stretch them tightly; then cut with a sharp scalpel widely across near the vessels, until they are exposed, and then peel them back on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples; then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the growth has appeared, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, along the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted fluids; then treat the wound like the others where one removes rot, even if some vessel that nourishes one of the testicles falls off; for no harm comes from this, and if the growth comes to all the vessels, it is necessary to remove the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and they dry up and cannot be helped.
