of the fingers
When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without force, and this is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any joint of the back of the foot, you must make the patient sit on a flat surface or on a table, completely upright, and place your foot on the part of the joint that sticks out, then press firmly with your foot, until it returns;
and when it is even, and nothing sticks out, place a two-legged table under the sole of the foot, then bind it tightly, and leave it for three days, then untie it;
and let him rest until he is healed.
