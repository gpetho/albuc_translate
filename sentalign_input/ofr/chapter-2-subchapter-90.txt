Worms are large convoluted veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in several parts of the body;
and occurs more in the legs of those who walk and who work and carry things, than in others.
It is therefore necessary that you sometimes administer a purgative of bile, and then heal it with basil.
The iron cure is done in two ways:
one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out;
and the other way is that you lift the vein, and pull it all the way out.
The cut is made in this way:
first bathe the leg with very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then tighten the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one place, or in two or in three, with a wide cut, then lift and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear;
and then tie it off, and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The raising of it is in this manner:
Raise the patient's leg, if there is a lot of hair, then put it in the bath, and sprinkle the leg with hot water until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you don't have a bath, warm it by the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the thigh to the top of the knee, or in the lower part at the ankle;
then open the skin with the hook, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when you feel it;
and it appears red and black, and when it enters the skin it looks like a white cord; 
then push the thread underneath, until it is lifted from the skin, and then hang it on the hook gently, then cut it in another place about three fingers above;
then scrape the skin above the vein until it appears, then lift it with the thread, as you did before, and hang it on another hook, as you did the first time;
then make another cut, or several if you need them, then lift it and cut it with your toe, then pull and lift it up to the second cut;
then pull it from cut to cut, until it comes out completely, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it and pull it, and put a thread underneath, and turn your hand from side to side, until it comes out;
and be careful not to cut it, because if it is cut, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and it will harm the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if the penis is contracted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must split it carefully, but do not cut it;
and pull it as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which the penis is cut is curved, and does not cut, so that it does not cut the vein; 
and it has a large curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the shape:
