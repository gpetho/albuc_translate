Know that the nail (pterygium) is of two kinds: one is fibrous and resembles a hard wen, and the other is not fibrous, but resembles a frozen white moisture, so that when one touches it with iron and tries to grasp it with tweezers, one cannot; and both kinds begin near the tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover all the sight and all the light and the movement of the eye.	Ungula occurs in two forms: either the nervous, which resembles a fine hard membrane; or the non-nervous, like a white congealed humidity; which, when the iron touches it or you try to pick it up with a hook, is cut through and the hook has no hold on it. Both kinds grow from the greater angle of the eye, whence they spread little by little until they cover the pupil and block both the vision and the movements of the eye.	0.70465213
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the fleshy membrane and tear it, and that the pupil is not pierced; and after the incision throw a little crushed salt into the eye, and some eyewash made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.	But beware lest the scalpel touch the corneal covering and cause a fissure in it and the pupil protrude. Then after the incision put into the eye a little powdered salt or an eye-lotion of verdigris, and leave it till the following day; then treat as may be necessary till it heals.	0.81374174
And if the nail (pterygium) is not fibrous, and you cannot push the needle in, and the hook cannot enter, this kind of nail (pterygium) is often treated with medicines; and they arise as I have described in the division, and if you wish to cut it, open the eye of the patient, and take a light, slightly sharp spatula of this shape:	If the ungula is non-nervous in origin and you cannot transfix it with a needle nor get a hook to hold fast in it, this sort is often successfully treated by medical means. So treat as described in the section.	0.6665044
And scrape the nail (pterygium) off subtly, and if you see that it diminishes a little and the scraping is effective, then drip from your mouth into the eye an eyewash made of litharge and red eyewash and crushed salt, and cover the eye until the next day; then resume the other work according to this same method, until it is all removed.	So treat as described in the section. But if you prefer to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take a fine smooth scalpel, rather blunt, like this and with this gently scrape away the ungula from above; and if you see that it is crumbling away and breaking down under the scraping, then immediately instil into the eye some eye-lotion of verdigris, or the red eye-lotion, or a little powdered salt, and bind the eye up till next day.	0.7546582
If something is wrong in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then resume the work as before, until it is healed.	Then repeat the operation on it till you have removed it all, unless an abscess forms in the eye, in which case cease the operation and treat the abscess till cured. Then repeat the treatment with the same scraping till healed.	0.69033694
And if the appearance of the flesh of the caruncle hinders the eye significantly, then lift it with a hook, and cut a part of it and not all, so that a flow of tears does not occur; then instill into the eye a red eyewash which is made of litharge.	As for a protuberance of flesh in the angle, if it causes great hurt pick it up with a hook and cut part of it away, with not too big an incision lest there be a flux of tears. Then into the canthus instil red eye-lotion or lotion of verdigris till healed.	0.74389094
