Chapter thirty-eight on cauterizing the bladder.
If there occurs in the bladder weakness and laxity from cold and humors, so that the sick person cannot hold their urine
then cauterize him with a cautery below the navel, over the bladder, where the pubic hair begins
and with a cautery to the right of the navel and another to its left
and let the distance after the cauterization, from each side, be the extent of a thumb-joint
and cauterize him with a cautery in the lower back or two cauteries if there is need for that
and let the cautery instrument be nail-shaped, as mentioned previously.
