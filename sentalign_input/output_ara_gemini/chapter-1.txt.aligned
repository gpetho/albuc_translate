And before we mention the procedure with it, it is necessary that we mention the nature of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.	Before we expatiate on the actual operation of cautery it is necessary to mention its advantages and disadvantages and the temperament upon which it is to be used.	0.8043557
So I say that the discussion about the nature of the benefit and harm of cautery is a long discussion, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and a group of sages have spoken about it and differed about it.	I say that a discourse on the advantage and disadvantage of cautery is a long one, a subtle learning, a hidden secret. A great number of wise men have spoken on the subject with differing opinions.	0.8262423
And I have summarized from their words the little, for fear of prolixity.	Lest I should be over long I have reduced their opinions to a summary.	0.44901335
So I say that cautery is generally useful for every bad temperament that is with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments, which are the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.	Now I say that the cautery has universal application for every ill constitution, whether organic or functional, with the exception of two: the functional hot temperament and the functional dry temperament.	0.72814155
As for the dry temperament with matter, they have differed about it, so some of them said that cautery is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite of that, that cautery is not suitable for a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is impossible to be cured from a hot dry disease with a hot dry remedy.	About the organic dry temperament the Ancients differed, some saying that cautery helps in a constitution of this kind, while others said the opposite: that cautery is of no use in a disease caused by heat or dryness; for fire is naturally hot and dry and it is obviously absurd to treat a hot dry sickness with a hot dry remedy.	0.83829606
And the one who says the opposite of that said that cautery with fire may benefit from a hot dry disease that occurs in people's bodies, because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the human body cold.	But he who holds the opposite view says that actual cautery may help in the case of such hot dry illnesses as arise in the human body; for when you compare the human body, humid as it is, with the nature of fire you find the human body cold.	0.8396865
And I say according to his saying because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that it is not appropriate for anyone to imagine about that matter except one who has practiced and trained in the field of cautery with extensive training and has observed the difference in people's temperaments and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and their duration.	I myself from much experience agree with this last opinion. However, no one should attempt this operation unless he has had long training and practice in the use of the cautery, and is fully acquainted with the various human temperaments, and the character of the complaints in themselves; their causes, symptoms, and duration.	0.7175012
And as for the other temperaments, there is no fear for you from them, especially the cold, moist diseases, for all the physicians have agreed on them and have not differed about the benefit of cautery in them.	Concerning the rest of the temperaments there is no reason for fear, particularly the cold and humid distempers; all medical men are agreed and none differs concerning the utility of the cautery in such cases.	0.8034338
And know, my sons, that among the secrets of treatment is cautery with fire, and its superiority over cautery with burning medicine, because fire is a simple substance whose action does not exceed the organ that is cauterized, and it does not harm another organ connected to it except with slight harm.	Now you should know, my sons, that the actual cautery and its superiority over cauterization with chemical caustics is one of the secrets of medicine. For fire is a simple substance having no action except upon the actual part cauterized; nor does it do more than slightly harm any adjacent part.	0.8657717
And cautery with burning medicine, its action may extend to what is beyond the organs, and perhaps it causes in the organ a disease whose treatment is difficult, and perhaps it kills.	But the effect of cauterization with caustic may spread to parts at a distance from that burnt; and also in the part cauterized it may give rise to a disease difficult to cure or even fatal.	0.72134715
And fire, due to its nobility and the generosity of its substance, does not do that unless it is excessive.	Whereas fire, on the other hand, on account of the nobility of its nature and its superiority has no such effect unless it is overdone.	0.8126112
And that has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of service and care for the craft and observing the realities of the matter, and for this reason I have dispensed with lengthy speech.	That has become clear to us by experience through length of service, devotion to the art, and acquaintance with the facts of the matter. So I need not prolong this discourse.	0.8048677
And were it not that it is not appropriate for this book of mine, I would have presented to you regarding fire a mysterious secret and the nature of its action in bodies and its expulsion of diseases, with philosophical, demonstrative words that are too subtle for your understanding.	Were it not inappropriate to this my book I should relate to you a deep secret concerning fire, the manner of its action on bodies and its expulsion of diseases; with a reasoned philosophical discourse too subtle for your understanding.	0.8949469
And know, my sons, that they have differed about the time in which cautery is suitable, and they have considered the best time to be the time of spring.	Know also, my sons, that the Ancients disagreed also as to the fit time for cautery, affirming that spring was the best.	0.80433714
And I say that cautery may be suitable in every time, because the harm that occurs from the time is absorbed in the benefit that is brought about by cautery, especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong, urgent pains that do not tolerate delay, because it is feared that they will be followed by a calamity that is greater than the slight harm that comes from the time.	Myself, I say that the cautery is suitable at all times; for whatever harm may arise from the season of the operation is utterly outdone by the benefit deriving from the cauterization itself; especially if the cautery is applied to pains that are severe, grievous, and swift, brooking no delay, because of the fear that the consequences may be more grave than the slight harm from the season.	0.87781686
And do not let it occur to your minds, my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that the cautery that cures from a certain disease will never return, and you consider it blameworthy.	Nor let enter your minds, my sons, the groundless notion of the laity and of ignorant doctors, that the complaint cured by the cautery never comes back later; do not cleave to this opinion.	0.82462025
And the matter is not as you thought, because cautery is just like the medicine that alters the temperament and dries the moistures that are the cause of the occurrence of pains, except that cautery is superior to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.	The fact is not as they think; for the cautery is homologous to the drug which alters the constitution and dries up the humidities that give rise to disorders. But the cautery excels the drug by the rapidity of its success, the strength of its action, and the potency of its powers.	0.84123373
And it is possible that the disease will return at some point in time, depending on the temperament of the patient, the establishment of his disease, its strength, and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities in it, and his neglect of himself in acquiring them from foods and such causes.	It may be that the disease will return at some time according to the temperament of the patient, and the persistence and virulence of the disease; and from the formation of a mass of superfluities in the body; from his neglect of himself in acquiring them from food; and from causes of a similar nature.	0.86384416
However, unless the disease in which cautery is used is a mild disease and in an organ with few superfluities and moistures, such as cauterizing the tooth for pain and the like, it is possible that the pain will not return in it, and that is in the minority of cases.	Of course, if the disease to which the cautery is applied be a slight one, and in a part only slightly liable to superfluities and humidities, as, for example, the cauterization of a molar tooth for toothache, and the like, then it may happen that the pain does not return; but that happens rarely.	0.83809817
And I have arranged this chapter on cautery into sections that I have organized from head to toe, to facilitate for the student what he wants from it, God willing.	Now I have arranged this book on cauterization by chapters, set in order from the head to the foot, to make it easy for the seeker to find what he wants.	0.7252053
